											By raising your hand,
											how many of you know
at least one person on the screen?
											Wow, it&#39;s almost a full house.
											It&#39;s true, they are very famous
in their fields.
											And do you know what
all of them have in common?
											They all died of pancreatic cancer.
											However, although it&#39;s very,
very sad this news,
											it&#39;s also thanks to their personal stories
											that we have raised awareness
of how lethal this disease can be.

											It&#39;s become the third cause
of cancer deaths,
											and only eight percent of the patients
will survive beyond five years.
											That&#39;s a very tiny number,
											especially if you compare it
with breast cancer,
											where the survival rate
is almost 90 percent.
											So it doesn&#39;t really come as a surprise
											that being diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer
											means facing an almost
certain death sentence.
											What&#39;s shocking, though,
is that in the last 40 years,
											this number hasn&#39;t changed a bit,
											while much more progress has been made
											with other types of tumors.
											So how can we make pancreatic cancer
treatment more effective?
											As a biomedical entrepreneur,
											I like to work on problems
that seem impossible,
											understanding their limitations
											and trying to find new,
innovative solutions
											that can change their outcome.

											The first piece of bad news
with pancreatic cancer
											is that your pancreas is in the middle
of your belly, literally.
											It&#39;s depicted in orange on the screen.
											But you can barely see it
											until I remove all the other
organs in front.
											It&#39;s also surrounded
by many other vital organs,
											like the liver, the stomach,
the bile duct.
											And the ability of the tumor
to grow into those organs
											is the reason why pancreatic cancer
											is one of the most painful tumor types.
											The hard-to-reach location
also prevents the doctor
											from surgically removing it,
											as is routinely done
for breast cancer, for example.
											So all of these reasons leave
chemotherapy as the only option
											for the pancreatic cancer patient.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This brings us to the second
piece of bad news.
											Pancreatic cancer tumors have
very few blood vessels.
											Why should we care
about the blood vessel of a tumor?
											Let&#39;s think for a second
how chemotherapy works.
											The drug is injected in the vein
											and it navigates throughout the body
until it reaches the tumor site.
											It&#39;s like driving on a highway,
trying to reach a destination.
											But what if your destination
doesn&#39;t have an exit on the highway?
											You will never get there.
											And that&#39;s exactly the same problem
											for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.
											The drugs navigate
throughout all of your body.
											They will reach healthy organs,
											resulting in high toxic effect
for the patients overall,
											but very little will go to the tumor.
											Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.

									<p>
											To me, it seems very counterintuitive
to have a whole-body treatment
											to target a specific organ.
											However, in the last 40 years,
											a lot of money, research
and effort have gone towards
											finding new, powerful drugs
to treat pancreatic cancer,
											but nothing has been done
in changing the way
											we deliver them to the patient.

											So after two pieces of bad news,
											I&#39;m going to give you
good news, hopefully.
											With a collaborator at MIT
											and the Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston,
											we have revolutionized
the way we treat cancer
											by making localized
drug delivery a reality.
											We are basically parachuting you
on top of your destination,
											avoiding your having to drive
all around the highway.
											We have embedded the drug
into devices that look like this one.
											They are flexible enough
that they can be folded
											to fit into the catheter,
											so the doctor can implant it
directly on top of the tumor
											with minimally invasive surgery.
											But they are solid enough
that once they are positioned
											on top of the tumor,
											they will act as a cage.
											They will actually
physically prevent the tumor
											from entering other organs,
											controlling the metastasis.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The devices are also biodegradable.
											That means that once in the body,
											they start dissolving,
											delivering the drug only locally,
slowly and more effectively
											than what is done with the current
whole-body treatment.
											In pre-clinical study,
we have demonstrated
											that this localized approach
											is able to improve by 12 times
the response to treatment.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we took a drug that is already known
											and by just delivering it locally
where it&#39;s needed the most,
											we allow a response
that is 12 times more powerful,
											reducing the systemic toxic effect.
											We are working relentlessly to bring
this technology to the next level.
											We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing
											and the animal model required
prior to asking the FDA for approval
											for clinical trials.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Currently, the majority of patients
will die from pancreatic cancer.
											We are hoping that one day,
											we can reduce their pain,
extend their life
											and potentially make pancreatic cancer
											a curable disease.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,
											we don&#39;t only make it
more powerful and less toxic,
											we are also opening the door
to finding new innovative solutions
											for almost all other impossible problems
											in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.
