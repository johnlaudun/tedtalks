Laura Indolfi,PT6M3S,2016-05-17T14:46:20+00:00,1246654,"Anyone who has lost a loved one to pancreatic cancer knows the devastating speed with which it can affect an otherwise healthy person. TED Fellow and biomedical entrepreneur Laura Indolfi is developing a revolutionary way to treat this complex and lethal disease: a drug delivery device that acts as a cage at the site of a tumor, preventing it from spreading and delivering medicine only where it's needed. ""We are hoping that one day we can make pancreatic cancer a curable disease,"" she says.","

By raising your hand,
how many of you know
at least one person on the screen?
Wow, it's almost a full house.
It's true, they are very famous
in their fields.
And do you know what
all of them have in common?
They all died of pancreatic cancer.
However, although it's very,
very sad this news,
it's also thanks to their personal stories
that we have raised awareness
of how lethal this disease can be.



It's become the third cause
of cancer deaths,
and only eight percent of the patients
will survive beyond five years.
That's a very tiny number,
especially if you compare it
with breast cancer,
where the survival rate
is almost 90 percent.
So it doesn't really come as a surprise
that being diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer
means facing an almost
certain death sentence.
What's shocking, though,
is that in the last 40 years,
this number hasn't changed a bit,
while much more progress has been made
with other types of tumors.
So how can we make pancreatic cancer
treatment more effective?
As a biomedical entrepreneur,
I like to work on problems
that seem impossible,
understanding their limitations
and trying to find new,
innovative solutions
that can change their outcome.



The first piece of bad news
with pancreatic cancer
is that your pancreas is in the middle
of your belly, literally.
It's depicted in orange on the screen.
But you can barely see it
until I remove all the other
organs in front.
It's also surrounded
by many other vital organs,
like the liver, the stomach,
the bile duct.
And the ability of the tumor
to grow into those organs
is the reason why pancreatic cancer
is one of the most painful tumor types.
The hard-to-reach location
also prevents the doctor
from surgically removing it,
as is routinely done
for breast cancer, for example.
So all of these reasons leave
chemotherapy as the only option
for the pancreatic cancer patient.



This brings us to the second
piece of bad news.
Pancreatic cancer tumors have
very few blood vessels.
Why should we care
about the blood vessel of a tumor?
Let's think for a second
how chemotherapy works.
The drug is injected in the vein
and it navigates throughout the body
until it reaches the tumor site.
It's like driving on a highway,
trying to reach a destination.
But what if your destination
doesn't have an exit on the highway?
You will never get there.
And that's exactly the same problem
for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.
The drugs navigate
throughout all of your body.
They will reach healthy organs,
resulting in high toxic effect
for the patients overall,
but very little will go to the tumor.
Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.



To me, it seems very counterintuitive
to have a whole-body treatment
to target a specific organ.
However, in the last 40 years,
a lot of money, research
and effort have gone towards
finding new, powerful drugs
to treat pancreatic cancer,
but nothing has been done
in changing the way
we deliver them to the patient.



So after two pieces of bad news,
I'm going to give you
good news, hopefully.
With a collaborator at MIT
and the Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston,
we have revolutionized
the way we treat cancer
by making localized
drug delivery a reality.
We are basically parachuting you
on top of your destination,
avoiding your having to drive
all around the highway.
We have embedded the drug
into devices that look like this one.
They are flexible enough
that they can be folded
to fit into the catheter,
so the doctor can implant it
directly on top of the tumor
with minimally invasive surgery.
But they are solid enough
that once they are positioned
on top of the tumor,
they will act as a cage.
They will actually
physically prevent the tumor
from entering other organs,
controlling the metastasis.



The devices are also biodegradable.
That means that once in the body,
they start dissolving,
delivering the drug only locally,
slowly and more effectively
than what is done with the current
whole-body treatment.
In pre-clinical study,
we have demonstrated
that this localized approach
is able to improve by 12 times
the response to treatment.



So we took a drug that is already known
and by just delivering it locally
where it's needed the most,
we allow a response
that is 12 times more powerful,
reducing the systemic toxic effect.
We are working relentlessly to bring
this technology to the next level.
We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing
and the animal model required
prior to asking the FDA for approval
for clinical trials.



Currently, the majority of patients
will die from pancreatic cancer.
We are hoping that one day,
we can reduce their pain,
extend their life
and potentially make pancreatic cancer
a curable disease.



By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,
we don't only make it
more powerful and less toxic,
we are also opening the door
to finding new innovative solutions
for almost all other impossible problems
in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.



Thank you very much.



(Applause)

Sebastian Junger,PT13M28S,2016-05-18T14:22:09+00:00,866459,"Sebastian Junger has seen war up close, and he knows the impact that battlefield trauma has on soldiers. But he suggests there's another major cause of pain for veterans when they come home: the experience of leaving the tribal closeness of the military and returning to an alienating and bitterly divided modern society. ""Sometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the vets,"" Junger says. ""I think the real question is if we can save ourselves."" (This talk comes from the PBS special ""TED Talks: War & Peace,"" which premieres Monday, May 30 at 9 p.m. EST.)","

I worked as a war reporter for 15 years
before I realized
that I really had a problem.
There was something really wrong with me.



This was about a year before 9/11,
and America wasn't at war yet.
We weren't talking about PTSD.
We were not yet talking
about the effect of trauma and war
on the human psyche.
I'd been in Afghanistan
for a couple of months
with the Northern Alliance
as they were fighting the Taliban.
And at that point the Taliban
had an air force,
they had fighter planes,
they had tanks, they had artillery,
and we really got hammered
pretty badly a couple of times.
We saw some very ugly things.
But I didn't really think it affected me.
I didn't think much about it.



I came home to New York, where I live.
Then one day I went down into the subway,
and for the first time in my life,
I knew real fear.
I had a massive panic attack.
I was way more scared
than I had ever been in Afghanistan.
Everything I was looking at seemed like
it was going to kill me,
but I couldn't explain why.
The trains were going too fast.
There were too many people.
The lights were too bright.
Everything was too loud,
everything was moving too quickly.
I backed up against a support column
and just waited for it.
When I couldn't take it any longer,
I ran out of the subway station
and walked wherever I was going.



Later, I found out that what I had
was short-term PTSD:
post-traumatic stress disorder.
We evolved as animals, as primates,
to survive periods of danger,
and if your life has been in danger,
you want to react to unfamiliar noises.
You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.
You want to have nightmares and flashbacks
of the thing that could kill you.
You want to be angry because it makes you
predisposed to fight,
or depressed, because it keeps you out
of circulation a little bit.
Keeps you safe.
It's not very pleasant,
but it's better than getting eaten.



Most people recover
from that pretty quickly.
It takes a few weeks, a few months.
I kept having panic attacks,
but they eventually went away.
I had no idea it was connected
to the war that I'd seen.
I just thought I was going crazy,
and then I thought, well,
now I'm not going crazy anymore.



About 20 percent of people, however,
wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.
They are not adapted to temporary danger.
They are maladapted for everyday life,
unless they get help.
We know that the people
who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD
are people who were abused as children,
who suffered trauma as children,
people who have low education levels,
people who have psychiatric
disorders in their family.
If you served in Vietnam
and your brother is schizophrenic,
you're way more likely to get
long-term PTSD from Vietnam.



So I started to study this
as a journalist,
and I realized that there was something
really strange going on.
The numbers seemed to be going
in the wrong direction.
Every war that we have
fought as a country,
starting with the Civil War,
the intensity of the combat has gone down.
As a result, the casualty rates
have gone down.
But disability rates have gone up.
They should be going
in the same direction,
but they're going in different directions.



The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
have produced, thank God,
a casualty rate about one third
of what it was in Vietnam.
But they've also created —
they've also produced
three times the disability rates.
Around 10 percent of the US military
is actively engaged in combat,
10 percent or under.
They're shooting at people,
killing people,
getting shot at,
seeing their friends get killed.
It's incredibly traumatic.
But it's only about 10 percent
of our military.
But about half of our military has filed
for some kind of PTSD compensation
from the government.



And suicide doesn't even fit into this
in a very logical way.
We've all heard the tragic statistic
of 22 vets a day, on average,
in this country, killing themselves.
Most people don't realize
that the majority of those suicides
are veterans of the Vietnam War,
that generation,
and their decision to take their own lives
actually might not be related
to the war they fought 50 years earlier.
In fact, there's no statistical connection
between combat and suicide.
If you're in the military
and you're in a lot of combat,
you're no more likely to kill yourself
than if you weren't.
In fact, one study found
that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,
you're actually slightly less likely
to commit suicide later.



I studied anthropology in college.
I did my fieldwork
on the Navajo reservation.
I wrote a thesis on Navajo
long-distance runners.
And recently, while
I was researching PTSD,
I had this thought.
I thought back to the work
I did when I was young,
and I thought, I bet the Navajo,
the Apache, the Comanche —
I mean, these are very warlike nations —
I bet they weren't getting
PTSD like we do.
When their warriors came back
from fighting the US military
or fighting each other,
I bet they pretty much just slipped
right back into tribal life.



And maybe what determines
the rate of long-term PTSD
isn't what happened out there,
but the kind of society you come back to.
And maybe if you come back
to a close, cohesive, tribal society,
you can get over trauma pretty quickly.
And if you come back
to an alienating, modern society,
you might remain traumatized
your entire life.
In other words, maybe the problem
isn't them, the vets;
maybe the problem is us.



Certainly, modern society
is hard on the human psyche
by every metric that we have.
As wealth goes up in a society,
the suicide rate goes up instead of down.
If you live in modern society,
you're up to eight times more likely
to suffer from depression in your lifetime
than if you live in a poor,
agrarian society.
Modern society has probably produced
the highest rates of suicide
and depression and anxiety
and loneliness and child abuse
ever in human history.
I saw one study
that compared women in Nigeria,
one of the most chaotic
and violent and corrupt
and poorest countries in Africa,
to women in North America.
And the highest rates of depression
were urban women in North America.
That was also the wealthiest group.



So let's go back to the US military.
Ten percent are in combat.
Around 50 percent have filed
for PTSD compensation.
So about 40 percent of veterans
really were not traumatized overseas
but have come home to discover
they are dangerously alienated
and depressed.
So what is happening with them?
What's going on with those people,
the phantom 40 percent that are troubled
but don't understand why?



Maybe it's this:
maybe they had an experience
of sort of tribal closeness
in their unit when they were overseas.
They were eating together,
sleeping together,
doing tasks and missions together.
They were trusting each other
with their lives.
And then they come home
and they have to give all that up
and they're coming back
to a society, a modern society,
which is hard on people
who weren't even in the military.
It's just hard on everybody.



And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.
But for a lot of these people,
maybe it's not trauma.
I mean, certainly,
soldiers are traumatized
and the ones who are
have to be treated for that.
But a lot of them —
maybe what's bothering them
is actually a kind of alienation.
I mean, maybe we just have
the wrong word for some of it,
and just changing our language,
our understanding,
would help a little bit.
""Post-deployment alienation disorder.""
Maybe even just calling it that
for some of these people
would allow them to stop imagining
trying to imagine a trauma
that didn't really happen
in order to explain a feeling
that really is happening.
And in fact, it's an extremely
dangerous feeling.
That alienation and depression
can lead to suicide.
These people are in danger.
It's very important to understand why.



The Israeli military has a PTSD rate
of around one percent.
The theory is that everyone in Israel
is supposed to serve in the military.
When soldiers come back
from the front line,
they're not going from a military
environment to a civilian environment.
They're coming back to a community
where everyone understands
about the military.
Everyone's been in it
or is going to be in it.
Everyone understands
the situation they're all in.
It's as if they're all in one big tribe.



We know that if you take a lab rat
and traumatize it and put it
in a cage by itself,
you can maintain its trauma symptoms
almost indefinitely.
And if you take that same lab rat
and put it in a cage with other rats,
after a couple of weeks,
it's pretty much OK.



After 9/11,
the murder rate in New York City
went down by 40 percent.
The suicide rate went down.
The violent crime rate in New York
went down after 9/11.
Even combat veterans of previous wars
who suffered from PTSD
said that their symptoms went down
after 9/11 happened.
The reason is that if you traumatize
an entire society,
we don't fall apart
and turn on one another.
We come together. We unify.
Basically, we tribalize,
and that process of unifying
feels so good and is so good for us,
that it even helps people
who are struggling
with mental health issues.
During the blitz in London,
admissions to psychiatric wards
went down during the bombings.



For a while, that was the kind of country
that American soldiers came
back to — a unified country.
We were sticking together.
We were trying to understand
the threat against us.
We were trying to help
ourselves and the world.
But that's changed.
Now, American soldiers,
American veterans are coming back
to a country that is so bitterly divided
that the two political parties
are literally accusing each other
of treason, of being
an enemy of the state,
of trying to undermine the security
and the welfare of their own country.
The gap between rich and poor
is the biggest it's ever been.
It's just getting worse.
Race relations are terrible.
There are demonstrations
and even riots in the streets
because of racial injustice.
And veterans know that any tribe
that treated itself that way — in fact,
any platoon that treated itself
that way — would never survive.
We've gotten used to it.
Veterans have gone away
and are coming back
and seeing their own country
with fresh eyes.
And they see what's going on.
This is the country they fought for.
No wonder they're depressed.
No wonder they're scared.



Sometimes, we ask ourselves
if we can save the vets.
I think the real question
is if we can save ourselves.
If we can,
I think the vets are going to be fine.
It's time for this country to unite,
if only to help the men and women
who fought to protect us.



Thank you very much.

Juno Mac,PT17M50S,2016-05-19T15:09:27+00:00,1964067,"Everyone has an opinion about how to legislate sex work (whether to legalize it, ban it or even tax it) ... but what do workers themselves think would work best? Activist Juno Mac explains four legal models that are being used around the world and shows us the model that she believes will work best to keep sex workers safe and offer greater self-determination. ""If you care about gender equality or poverty or migration or public health, then sex worker rights matter to you,"" she says. ""Make space for us in your movements."" (Adult themes)","

I'm not like most of the people
you'll have heard speaking
about prostitution before.
I'm not a police officer
or a social worker.
I'm not an academic,
a journalist or a politician.
And as you'll probably have
picked up from Maryam's blurb,
I'm not a nun, either.



(Laughter)



Most of those people would tell you
that selling sex is degrading;
that no one would ever choose to do it;
that it's dangerous;
women get abused and killed.
In fact, most of those people would say,
""There should be a law against it!""
Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.
It sounded reasonable to me
until the closing months of 2009,
when I was working two dead-end,
minimum-wage jobs.
Every month my wages would just
replenish my overdraft.
I was exhausted and my life
was going nowhere.
Like many others before me,
I decided sex for money
was a better option.
Now don't get me wrong —
I would have loved
to have won the lottery instead.
But it wasn't going
to happen anytime soon,
and my rent needed paying.
So I signed up for my first
shift in a brothel.



In the years that have passed,
I've had a lot of time to think.
I've reconsidered the ideas
I once had about prostitution.
I've given a lot of thought to consent
and the nature of work under capitalism.
I've thought about gender inequality
and the sexual and reproductive
labor of women.
I've experienced exploitation
and violence at work.
I've thought about what's needed
to protect other sex workers
from these things.
Maybe you've thought about them, too.
In this talk,
I'll take you through
the four main legal approaches
applied to sex work throughout the world,
and explain why they don't work;
why prohibiting the sex industry
actually exacerbates every harm
that sex workers are vulnerable to.
Then I'm going tell you about what we,
as sex workers, actually want.



The first approach
is full criminalization.
Half the world,
including Russia, South Africa
and most of the US,
regulates sex work by criminalizing
everyone involved.
So that's seller, buyer and third parties.
Lawmakers in these countries
apparently hope
that the fear of getting arrested
will deter people from selling sex.
But if you're forced to choose
between obeying the law
and feeding yourself or your family,
you're going to do the work anyway,
and take the risk.



Criminalization is a trap.
It's hard to get a conventional job
when you have a criminal record.
Potential employers won't hire you.
Assuming you still need money,
you'll stay in the more flexible,
informal economy.
The law forces you to keep selling sex,
which is the exact opposite
of its intended effect.
Being criminalized leaves you exposed
to mistreatment by the state itself.
In many places you may be coerced
into paying a bribe
or even into having sex
with a police officer
to avoid arrest.
Police and prison guards
in Cambodia, for example,
have been documented
subjecting sex workers
to what can only be described as torture:
threats at gunpoint,
beatings, electric shocks, rape
and denial of food.



Another worrying thing:
if you're selling sex in places
like Kenya, South Africa or New York,
a police officer can arrest you
if you're caught carrying condoms,
because condoms can legally be used
as evidence that you're selling sex.
Obviously, this increases HIV risk.
Imagine knowing if you're busted
carrying condoms,
it'll be used against you.
It's a pretty strong incentive
to leave them at home, right?
Sex workers working in these places
are forced to make a tough choice
between risking arrest
or having risky sex.
What would you choose?
Would you pack condoms to go to work?
How about if you're worried
the police officer would rape you
when he got you in the van?



The second approach to regulating
sex work seen in these countries
is partial criminalization,
where the buying and selling
of sex are legal,
but surrounding activities,
like brothel-keeping or soliciting
on the street, are banned.
Laws like these —
we have them in the UK and in France —
essentially say to us sex workers,
""Hey, we don't mind you selling sex,
just make sure it's done
behind closed doors
and all alone.""
And brothel-keeping, by the way,
is defined as just two or more
sex workers working together.
Making that illegal means
that many of us work alone,
which obviously makes us
vulnerable to violent offenders.
But we're also vulnerable
if we choose to break the law
by working together.
A couple of years ago,
a friend of mine was nervous
after she was attacked at work,
so I said that she could see her clients
from my place for a while.
During that time,
we had another guy turn nasty.
I told the guy to leave
or I'd call the police.
And he looked at the two of us and said,
""You girls can't call the cops.
You're working together,
this place is illegal.""
He was right.
He eventually left
without getting physically violent,
but the knowledge
that we were breaking the law
empowered that man to threaten us.
He felt confident he'd get away with it.



The prohibition of street prostitution
also causes more harm
than it prevents.
Firstly, to avoid getting arrested,
street workers take risks
to avoid detection,
and that means working alone
or in isolated locations like dark forests
where they're vulnerable to attack.
If you're caught selling sex outdoors,
you pay a fine.
How do you pay that fine
without going back to the streets?
It was the need for money
that saw you in the streets
in the first place.
And so the fines stack up,
and you're caught in a vicious cycle
of selling sex to pay the fines
you got for selling sex.



Let me tell you about Mariana Popa
who worked in Redbridge, East London.
The street workers on her patch
would normally wait for clients in groups
for safety in numbers
and to warn each other about how
to avoid dangerous guys.
But during a police crackdown
on sex workers and their clients,
she was forced to work alone
to avoid being arrested.
She was stabbed to death
in the early hours of October 29, 2013.
She had been working later than usual
to try to pay off a fine
she had received for soliciting.



So if criminalizing
sex workers hurts them,
why not just criminalize
the people who buy sex?
This is the aim of the third approach
I want to talk about —
the Swedish or Nordic
model of sex-work law.
The idea behind this law
is that selling sex
is intrinsically harmful
and so you're, in fact, helping
sex workers by removing the option.
Despite growing support
for what's often described
as the ""end demand"" approach,
there's no evidence that it works.
There's just as much prostitution
in Sweden as there was before.
Why might that be?
It's because people selling sex
often don't have other options for income.
If you need that money,
the only effect that a drop
in business is going have
is to force you to lower your prices
or offer more risky sexual services.
If you need to find more clients,
you might seek the help of a manager.
So you see, rather than putting a stop
to what's often descried as pimping,
a law like this actually gives oxygen
to potentially abusive third parties.



To keep safe in my work,
I try not to take bookings from someone
who calls me from a withheld number.
If it's a home or a hotel visit,
I try to get a full name and details.
If I worked under the Swedish model,
a client would be too scared
to give me that information.
I might have no other choice
but to accept a booking
from a man who is untraceable
if he later turns out to be violent.
If you need their money,
you need to protect
your clients from the police.
If you work outdoors,
that means working alone
or in isolated locations,
just as if you were criminalized yourself.
It might mean getting into cars quicker,
less negotiating time
means snap decisions.
Is this guy dangerous or just nervous?
Can you afford to take the risk?
Can you afford not to?



Something I'm often hearing is,
""Prostitution would be fine
if we made it legal and regulated it.""
We call that approach legalization,
and it's used by countries
like the Netherlands, Germany
and Nevada in the US.
But it's not a great
model for human rights.
And in state-controlled prostitution,
commercial sex can only happen
in certain legally-designated
areas or venues,
and sex workers are made to comply
with special restrictions,
like registration
and forced health checks.
Regulation sounds great on paper,
but politicians deliberately make
regulation around the sex industry
expensive and difficult to comply with.
It creates a two-tiered system:
legal and illegal work.
We sometimes call it
""backdoor criminalization.""
Rich, well-connected brothel owners
can comply with the regulations,
but more marginalized people
find those hoops
impossible to jump through.
And even if it's possible in principle,
getting a license or proper venue
takes time and costs money.
It's not going to be an option
for someone who's desperate
and needs money tonight.
They might be a refugee
or fleeing domestic abuse.
In this two-tiered system,
the most vulnerable people
are forced to work illegally,
so they're still exposed to all
the dangers of criminalization
I mentioned earlier.



So.
It's looking like all attempts to control
or prevent sex work from happening
makes things more dangerous
for people selling sex.
Fear of law enforcement makes them
work alone in isolated locations,
and allows clients and even cops
to get abusive in the knowledge
they'll get away with it.
Fines and criminal records force
people to keep selling sex,
rather than enabling them to stop.
Crackdowns on buyers drive sellers
to take dangerous risks
and into the arms
of potentially abusive managers.



These laws also reinforce stigma
and hatred against sex workers.
When France temporarily brought in
the Swedish model two years ago,
ordinary citizens took it as a cue
to start carrying out vigilante attacks
against people working on the street.
In Sweden, opinion surveys show
that significantly more people want
sex workers to be arrested now
than before the law was brought in.
If prohibition is this harmful,
you might ask, why it so popular?



Firstly, sex work is and always
has been a survival strategy
for all kinds of unpopular
minority groups:
people of color,
migrants,
people with disabilities,
LGBTQ people,
particularly trans women.
These are the groups most heavily profiled
and punished through prohibitionist law.
I don't think this is an accident.
These laws have political support
precisely because they target people
that voters don't want
to see or know about.



Why else might people support prohibition?
Well, lots of people have
understandable fears about trafficking.
Folks think that foreign women
kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery
can be saved by shutting
a whole industry down.
So let's talk about trafficking.
Forced labor does occur
in many industries,
especially those where the workers
are migrants or otherwise vulnerable,
and this needs to be addressed.
But it's best addressed with legislation
targeting those specific abuses,
not an entire industry.
When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants
drowned while picking cockles
in Morecambe Bay in 2004,
there were no calls to outlaw
the entire seafood industry
to save trafficking victims.
The solution is clearly to give
workers more legal protections,
allowing them to resist abuse
and report it to authorities
without fear of arrest.



The way the term trafficking
is thrown around
implies that all undocumented
migration into prostitution is forced.
In fact, many migrants
have made a decision,
out of economic need,
to place themselves into the hands
of people smugglers.
Many do this with the full knowledge
that they'll be selling sex
when they reach their destination.
And yes, it can often be the case
that these people smugglers
demand exorbitant fees,
coerce migrants into work
they don't want to do
and abuse them when they're vulnerable.
That's true of prostitution,
but it's also true of agricultural work,
hospitality work and domestic work.
Ultimately, nobody wants
to be forced to do any kind of work,
but that's a risk many migrants
are willing to take,
because of what they're leaving behind.
If people were allowed to migrate legally
they wouldn't have to place their lives
into the hands of people smugglers.
The problems arise
from the criminalization of migration,
just as they do from the criminalization
of sex work itself.



This is a lesson of history.
If you try to prohibit something
that people want or need to do,
whether that's drinking alcohol
or crossing borders
or getting an abortion
or selling sex,
you create more problems than you solve.
Prohibition barely makes a difference
to the amount of people
actually doing those things.
But it makes a huge difference
as to whether or not
they're safe when they do them.



Why else might people support prohibition?
As a feminist, I know
that the sex industry is a site
of deeply entrenched social inequality.
It's a fact that most buyers of sex
are men with money,
and most sellers are women without.
You can agree with all that — I do —
and still think prohibition
is a terrible policy.
In a better, more equal world,
maybe there would be far fewer
people selling sex to survive,
but you can't simply legislate
a better world into existence.
If someone needs to sell sex
because they're poor
or because they're homeless
or because they're undocumented
and they can't find legal work,
taking away that option
doesn't make them any less poor
or house them
or change their immigration status.



People worry that selling
sex is degrading.
Ask yourself: is it more degrading
than going hungry
or seeing your children go hungry?
There's no call to ban rich people
from hiring nannies
or getting manicures,
even though most of the people
doing that labor are poor, migrant women.
It's the fact of poor migrant women
selling sex specifically
that has some feminists uncomfortable.
And I can understand
why the sex industry provokes
strong feelings.
People have all kinds
of complicated feelings
when it comes to sex.
But we can't make policy
on the basis of mere feelings,
especially not over
the heads of the people
actually effected by those policies.
If we get fixated on
the abolition of sex work,
we end up worrying more
about a particular manifestation
of gender inequality,
rather than about the underlying causes.



People get really hung up on the question,
""Well, would you want
your daughter doing it?""
That's the wrong question.
Instead, imagine she is doing it.
How safe is she at work tonight?
Why isn't she safer?



So we've looked at full criminalization,
partial criminalization,
the Swedish or Nordic Model
and legalization,
and how they all cause harm.
Something I never hear asked is:
""What do sex workers want?""
After all, we're the ones
most affected by these laws.



New Zealand decriminalized
sex work in 2003.
It's crucial to remember
that decriminalization and legalization
are not the same thing.
Decriminalization means
the removal of laws
that punitively target the sex industry,
instead treating sex work
much like any other kind of work.
In New Zealand, people
can work together for safety,
and employers of sex workers
are accountable to the state.
A sex worker can refuse
to see a client at any time,
for any reason,
and 96 percent of street workers
report that they feel the law
protects their rights.
New Zealand hasn't actually
seen an increase
in the amount of people doing sex work,
but decriminalizing it
has made it a lot safer.
But the lesson from New Zealand
isn't just that its particular
legislation is good,
but that crucially,
it was written in collaboration
with sex workers;
namely, the New Zealand
Prostitutes' Collective.
When it came to making sex work safer,
they were ready to hear it straight
from sex workers themselves.



Here in the UK,
I'm part of sex worker-led groups
like the Sex Worker Open University
and the English Collective of Prostitutes.
And we form part of a global movement
demanding decriminalization
and self-determination.
The universal symbol of our movement
is the red umbrella.
We're supported in our demands
by global bodies like UNAIDS,
the World Health Organization
and Amnesty International.
But we need more allies.
If you care about gender equality
or poverty or migration or public health,
then sex worker rights matter to you.
Make space for us in your movements.
That means not only listening
to sex workers when we speak
but amplifying our voices.
Resist those who silence us,
those who say that a prostitute
is either too victimized,
too damaged to know
what's best for herself,
or else too privileged
and too removed from real hardship,
not representative of the millions
of voiceless victims.
This distinction between victim
and empowered is imaginary.
It exists purely to discredit sex workers
and make it easy to ignore us.



No doubt many of you work for a living.
Well, sex work is work, too.
Just like you,
some of us like our jobs,
some of us hate them.
Ultimately, most of us
have mixed feelings.
But how we feel about our work
isn't the point.
And how others feel
about our work certainly isn't.
What's important is that we have
the right to work safely
and on our own terms.



Sex workers are real people.
We've had complicated experiences
and complicated responses
to those experiences.
But our demands are not complicated.
You can ask expensive
escorts in New York City,
brothel workers in Cambodia,
street workers in South Africa
and every girl on the roster
at my old job in Soho,
and they will all tell you the same thing.
You can speak to millions of sex workers
and countless sex work-led organizations.
We want full decriminalization
and labor rights as workers.



I'm just one sex worker
on the stage today,
but I'm bringing a message
from all over the world.



Thank you.



(Applause)
