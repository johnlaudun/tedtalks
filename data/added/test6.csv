Laura Indolfi,PT6M3S,2016-05-17T14:46:20+00:00,1246654,"Anyone who has lost a loved one to pancreatic cancer knows the devastating speed with which it can affect an otherwise healthy person. TED Fellow and biomedical entrepreneur Laura Indolfi is developing a revolutionary way to treat this complex and lethal disease: a drug delivery device that acts as a cage at the site of a tumor, preventing it from spreading and delivering medicine only where it's needed. ""We are hoping that one day we can make pancreatic cancer a curable disease,"" she says.","By raising your hand,how many of you knowat least one person on the screen?Wow, it's almost a full house.It's true, they are very famousin their fields.And do you know whatall of them have in common?They all died of pancreatic cancer.However, although it's very,very sad this news,it's also thanks to their personal storiesthat we have raised awarenessof how lethal this disease can be.It's become the third causeof cancer deaths,and only eight percent of the patientswill survive beyond five years.That's a very tiny number,especially if you compare itwith breast cancer,where the survival rateis almost 90 percent.So it doesn't really come as a surprisethat being diagnosedwith pancreatic cancermeans facing an almostcertain death sentence.What's shocking, though,is that in the last 40 years,this number hasn't changed a bit,while much more progress has been madewith other types of tumors.So how can we make pancreatic cancertreatment more effective?As a biomedical entrepreneur,I like to work on problemsthat seem impossible,understanding their limitationsand trying to find new,innovative solutionsthat can change their outcome.The first piece of bad newswith pancreatic canceris that your pancreas is in the middleof your belly, literally.It's depicted in orange on the screen.But you can barely see ituntil I remove all the otherorgans in front.It's also surroundedby many other vital organs,like the liver, the stomach,the bile duct.And the ability of the tumorto grow into those organsis the reason why pancreatic canceris one of the most painful tumor types.The hard-to-reach locationalso prevents the doctorfrom surgically removing it,as is routinely donefor breast cancer, for example.So all of these reasons leavechemotherapy as the only optionfor the pancreatic cancer patient.This brings us to the secondpiece of bad news.Pancreatic cancer tumors havevery few blood vessels.Why should we careabout the blood vessel of a tumor?Let's think for a secondhow chemotherapy works.The drug is injected in the veinand it navigates throughout the bodyuntil it reaches the tumor site.It's like driving on a highway,trying to reach a destination.But what if your destinationdoesn't have an exit on the highway?You will never get there.And that's exactly the same problemfor chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.The drugs navigatethroughout all of your body.They will reach healthy organs,resulting in high toxic effectfor the patients overall,but very little will go to the tumor.Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.To me, it seems very counterintuitiveto have a whole-body treatmentto target a specific organ.However, in the last 40 years,a lot of money, researchand effort have gone towardsfinding new, powerful drugsto treat pancreatic cancer,but nothing has been donein changing the waywe deliver them to the patient.So after two pieces of bad news,I'm going to give yougood news, hopefully.With a collaborator at MITand the MassachusettsGeneral Hospital in Boston,we have revolutionizedthe way we treat cancerby making localizeddrug delivery a reality.We are basically parachuting youon top of your destination,avoiding your having to driveall around the highway.We have embedded the druginto devices that look like this one.They are flexible enoughthat they can be foldedto fit into the catheter,so the doctor can implant itdirectly on top of the tumorwith minimally invasive surgery.But they are solid enoughthat once they are positionedon top of the tumor,they will act as a cage.They will actuallyphysically prevent the tumorfrom entering other organs,controlling the metastasis.The devices are also biodegradable.That means that once in the body,they start dissolving,delivering the drug only locally,slowly and more effectivelythan what is done with the currentwhole-body treatment.In pre-clinical study,we have demonstratedthat this localized approachis able to improve by 12 timesthe response to treatment.So we took a drug that is already knownand by just delivering it locallywhere it's needed the most,we allow a responsethat is 12 times more powerful,reducing the systemic toxic effect.We are working relentlessly to bringthis technology to the next level.We are finalizing the pre-clinical testingand the animal model requiredprior to asking the FDA for approvalfor clinical trials.Currently, the majority of patientswill die from pancreatic cancer.We are hoping that one day,we can reduce their pain,extend their lifeand potentially make pancreatic cancera curable disease.By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,we don't only make itmore powerful and less toxic,we are also opening the doorto finding new innovative solutionsfor almost all other impossible problemsin pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.Thank you very much.(Applause)"
Sebastian Junger,PT13M28S,2016-05-18T14:22:09+00:00,866459,"Sebastian Junger has seen war up close, and he knows the impact that battlefield trauma has on soldiers. But he suggests there's another major cause of pain for veterans when they come home: the experience of leaving the tribal closeness of the military and returning to an alienating and bitterly divided modern society. ""Sometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the vets,"" Junger says. ""I think the real question is if we can save ourselves."" (This talk comes from the PBS special ""TED Talks: War & Peace,"" which premieres Monday, May 30 at 9 p.m. EST.)","I worked as a war reporter for 15 yearsbefore I realizedthat I really had a problem.There was something really wrong with me.This was about a year before 9/11,and America wasn't at war yet.We weren't talking about PTSD.We were not yet talkingabout the effect of trauma and waron the human psyche.I'd been in Afghanistanfor a couple of monthswith the Northern Allianceas they were fighting the Taliban.And at that point the Talibanhad an air force,they had fighter planes,they had tanks, they had artillery,and we really got hammeredpretty badly a couple of times.We saw some very ugly things.But I didn't really think it affected me.I didn't think much about it.I came home to New York, where I live.Then one day I went down into the subway,and for the first time in my life,I knew real fear.I had a massive panic attack.I was way more scaredthan I had ever been in Afghanistan.Everything I was looking at seemed likeit was going to kill me,but I couldn't explain why.The trains were going too fast.There were too many people.The lights were too bright.Everything was too loud,everything was moving too quickly.I backed up against a support columnand just waited for it.When I couldn't take it any longer,I ran out of the subway stationand walked wherever I was going.Later, I found out that what I hadwas short-term PTSD:post-traumatic stress disorder.We evolved as animals, as primates,to survive periods of danger,and if your life has been in danger,you want to react to unfamiliar noises.You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.You want to have nightmares and flashbacksof the thing that could kill you.You want to be angry because it makes youpredisposed to fight,or depressed, because it keeps you outof circulation a little bit.Keeps you safe.It's not very pleasant,but it's better than getting eaten.Most people recoverfrom that pretty quickly.It takes a few weeks, a few months.I kept having panic attacks,but they eventually went away.I had no idea it was connectedto the war that I'd seen.I just thought I was going crazy,and then I thought, well,now I'm not going crazy anymore.About 20 percent of people, however,wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.They are not adapted to temporary danger.They are maladapted for everyday life,unless they get help.We know that the peoplewho are vulnerable to long-term PTSDare people who were abused as children,who suffered trauma as children,people who have low education levels,people who have psychiatricdisorders in their family.If you served in Vietnamand your brother is schizophrenic,you're way more likely to getlong-term PTSD from Vietnam.So I started to study thisas a journalist,and I realized that there was somethingreally strange going on.The numbers seemed to be goingin the wrong direction.Every war that we havefought as a country,starting with the Civil War,the intensity of the combat has gone down.As a result, the casualty rateshave gone down.But disability rates have gone up.They should be goingin the same direction,but they're going in different directions.The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistanhave produced, thank God,a casualty rate about one thirdof what it was in Vietnam.But they've also created â€”they've also producedthree times the disability rates.Around 10 percent of the US militaryis actively engaged in combat,10 percent or under.They're shooting at people,killing people,getting shot at,seeing their friends get killed.It's incredibly traumatic.But it's only about 10 percentof our military.But about half of our military has filedfor some kind of PTSD compensationfrom the government.And suicide doesn't even fit into thisin a very logical way.We've all heard the tragic statisticof 22 vets a day, on average,in this country, killing themselves.Most people don't realizethat the majority of those suicidesare veterans of the Vietnam War,that generation,and their decision to take their own livesactually might not be relatedto the war they fought 50 years earlier.In fact, there's no statistical connectionbetween combat and suicide.If you're in the militaryand you're in a lot of combat,you're no more likely to kill yourselfthan if you weren't.In fact, one study foundthat if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,you're actually slightly less likelyto commit suicide later.I studied anthropology in college.I did my fieldworkon the Navajo reservation.I wrote a thesis on Navajolong-distance runners.And recently, whileI was researching PTSD,I had this thought.I thought back to the workI did when I was young,and I thought, I bet the Navajo,the Apache, the Comanche â€”I mean, these are very warlike nations â€”I bet they weren't gettingPTSD like we do.When their warriors came backfrom fighting the US militaryor fighting each other,I bet they pretty much just slippedright back into tribal life.And maybe what determinesthe rate of long-term PTSDisn't what happened out there,but the kind of society you come back to.And maybe if you come backto a close, cohesive, tribal society,you can get over trauma pretty quickly.And if you come backto an alienating, modern society,you might remain traumatizedyour entire life.In other words, maybe the problemisn't them, the vets;maybe the problem is us.Certainly, modern societyis hard on the human psycheby every metric that we have.As wealth goes up in a society,the suicide rate goes up instead of down.If you live in modern society,you're up to eight times more likelyto suffer from depression in your lifetimethan if you live in a poor,agrarian society.Modern society has probably producedthe highest rates of suicideand depression and anxietyand loneliness and child abuseever in human history.I saw one studythat compared women in Nigeria,one of the most chaoticand violent and corruptand poorest countries in Africa,to women in North America.And the highest rates of depressionwere urban women in North America.That was also the wealthiest group.So let's go back to the US military.Ten percent are in combat.Around 50 percent have filedfor PTSD compensation.So about 40 percent of veteransreally were not traumatized overseasbut have come home to discoverthey are dangerously alienatedand depressed.So what is happening with them?What's going on with those people,the phantom 40 percent that are troubledbut don't understand why?Maybe it's this:maybe they had an experienceof sort of tribal closenessin their unit when they were overseas.They were eating together,sleeping together,doing tasks and missions together.They were trusting each otherwith their lives.And then they come homeand they have to give all that upand they're coming backto a society, a modern society,which is hard on peoplewho weren't even in the military.It's just hard on everybody.And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.But for a lot of these people,maybe it's not trauma.I mean, certainly,soldiers are traumatizedand the ones who arehave to be treated for that.But a lot of them â€”maybe what's bothering themis actually a kind of alienation.I mean, maybe we just havethe wrong word for some of it,and just changing our language,our understanding,would help a little bit.""Post-deployment alienation disorder.""Maybe even just calling it thatfor some of these peoplewould allow them to stop imaginingtrying to imagine a traumathat didn't really happenin order to explain a feelingthat really is happening.And in fact, it's an extremelydangerous feeling.That alienation and depressioncan lead to suicide.These people are in danger.It's very important to understand why.The Israeli military has a PTSD rateof around one percent.The theory is that everyone in Israelis supposed to serve in the military.When soldiers come backfrom the front line,they're not going from a militaryenvironment to a civilian environment.They're coming back to a communitywhere everyone understandsabout the military.Everyone's been in itor is going to be in it.Everyone understandsthe situation they're all in.It's as if they're all in one big tribe.We know that if you take a lab ratand traumatize it and put itin a cage by itself,you can maintain its trauma symptomsalmost indefinitely.And if you take that same lab ratand put it in a cage with other rats,after a couple of weeks,it's pretty much OK.After 9/11,the murder rate in New York Citywent down by 40 percent.The suicide rate went down.The violent crime rate in New Yorkwent down after 9/11.Even combat veterans of previous warswho suffered from PTSDsaid that their symptoms went downafter 9/11 happened.The reason is that if you traumatizean entire society,we don't fall apartand turn on one another.We come together. We unify.Basically, we tribalize,and that process of unifyingfeels so good and is so good for us,that it even helps peoplewho are strugglingwith mental health issues.During the blitz in London,admissions to psychiatric wardswent down during the bombings.For a while, that was the kind of countrythat American soldiers cameback to â€” a unified country.We were sticking together.We were trying to understandthe threat against us.We were trying to helpourselves and the world.But that's changed.Now, American soldiers,American veterans are coming backto a country that is so bitterly dividedthat the two political partiesare literally accusing each otherof treason, of beingan enemy of the state,of trying to undermine the securityand the welfare of their own country.The gap between rich and pooris the biggest it's ever been.It's just getting worse.Race relations are terrible.There are demonstrationsand even riots in the streetsbecause of racial injustice.And veterans know that any tribethat treated itself that way â€” in fact,any platoon that treated itselfthat way â€” would never survive.We've gotten used to it.Veterans have gone awayand are coming backand seeing their own countrywith fresh eyes.And they see what's going on.This is the country they fought for.No wonder they're depressed.No wonder they're scared.Sometimes, we ask ourselvesif we can save the vets.I think the real questionis if we can save ourselves.If we can,I think the vets are going to be fine.It's time for this country to unite,if only to help the men and womenwho fought to protect us.Thank you very much.(Applause)"
Juno Mac,PT17M50S,2016-05-19T15:09:27+00:00,1964067,"Everyone has an opinion about how to legislate sex work (whether to legalize it, ban it or even tax it) ... but what do workers themselves think would work best? Activist Juno Mac explains four legal models that are being used around the world and shows us the model that she believes will work best to keep sex workers safe and offer greater self-determination. ""If you care about gender equality or poverty or migration or public health, then sex worker rights matter to you,"" she says. ""Make space for us in your movements."" (Adult themes)","I'm not like most of the peopleyou'll have heard speakingabout prostitution before.I'm not a police officeror a social worker.I'm not an academic,a journalist or a politician.And as you'll probably havepicked up from Maryam's blurb,I'm not a nun, either.(Laughter)Most of those people would tell youthat selling sex is degrading;that no one would ever choose to do it;that it's dangerous;women get abused and killed.In fact, most of those people would say,""There should be a law against it!""Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.It sounded reasonable to meuntil the closing months of 2009,when I was working two dead-end,minimum-wage jobs.Every month my wages would justreplenish my overdraft.I was exhausted and my lifewas going nowhere.Like many others before me,I decided sex for moneywas a better option.Now don't get me wrong â€”I would have lovedto have won the lottery instead.But it wasn't goingto happen anytime soon,and my rent needed paying.So I signed up for my firstshift in a brothel.In the years that have passed,I've had a lot of time to think.I've reconsidered the ideasI once had about prostitution.I've given a lot of thought to consentand the nature of work under capitalism.I've thought about gender inequalityand the sexual and reproductivelabor of women.I've experienced exploitationand violence at work.I've thought about what's neededto protect other sex workersfrom these things.Maybe you've thought about them, too.In this talk,I'll take you throughthe four main legal approachesapplied to sex work throughout the world,and explain why they don't work;why prohibiting the sex industryactually exacerbates every harmthat sex workers are vulnerable to.Then I'm going tell you about what we,as sex workers, actually want.The first approachis full criminalization.Half the world,including Russia, South Africaand most of the US,regulates sex work by criminalizingeveryone involved.So that's seller, buyer and third parties.Lawmakers in these countriesapparently hopethat the fear of getting arrestedwill deter people from selling sex.But if you're forced to choosebetween obeying the lawand feeding yourself or your family,you're going to do the work anyway,and take the risk.Criminalization is a trap.It's hard to get a conventional jobwhen you have a criminal record.Potential employers won't hire you.Assuming you still need money,you'll stay in the more flexible,informal economy.The law forces you to keep selling sex,which is the exact oppositeof its intended effect.Being criminalized leaves you exposedto mistreatment by the state itself.In many places you may be coercedinto paying a bribeor even into having sexwith a police officerto avoid arrest.Police and prison guardsin Cambodia, for example,have been documentedsubjecting sex workersto what can only be described as torture:threats at gunpoint,beatings, electric shocks, rapeand denial of food.Another worrying thing:if you're selling sex in placeslike Kenya, South Africa or New York,a police officer can arrest youif you're caught carrying condoms,because condoms can legally be usedas evidence that you're selling sex.Obviously, this increases HIV risk.Imagine knowing if you're bustedcarrying condoms,it'll be used against you.It's a pretty strong incentiveto leave them at home, right?Sex workers working in these placesare forced to make a tough choicebetween risking arrestor having risky sex.What would you choose?Would you pack condoms to go to work?How about if you're worriedthe police officer would rape youwhen he got you in the van?The second approach to regulatingsex work seen in these countriesis partial criminalization,where the buying and sellingof sex are legal,but surrounding activities,like brothel-keeping or solicitingon the street, are banned.Laws like these â€”we have them in the UK and in France â€”essentially say to us sex workers,""Hey, we don't mind you selling sex,just make sure it's donebehind closed doorsand all alone.""And brothel-keeping, by the way,is defined as just two or moresex workers working together.Making that illegal meansthat many of us work alone,which obviously makes usvulnerable to violent offenders.But we're also vulnerableif we choose to break the lawby working together.A couple of years ago,a friend of mine was nervousafter she was attacked at work,so I said that she could see her clientsfrom my place for a while.During that time,we had another guy turn nasty.I told the guy to leaveor I'd call the police.And he looked at the two of us and said,""You girls can't call the cops.You're working together,this place is illegal.""He was right.He eventually leftwithout getting physically violent,but the knowledgethat we were breaking the lawempowered that man to threaten us.He felt confident he'd get away with it.The prohibition of street prostitutionalso causes more harmthan it prevents.Firstly, to avoid getting arrested,street workers take risksto avoid detection,and that means working aloneor in isolated locations like dark forestswhere they're vulnerable to attack.If you're caught selling sex outdoors,you pay a fine.How do you pay that finewithout going back to the streets?It was the need for moneythat saw you in the streetsin the first place.And so the fines stack up,and you're caught in a vicious cycleof selling sex to pay the finesyou got for selling sex.Let me tell you about Mariana Popawho worked in Redbridge, East London.The street workers on her patchwould normally wait for clients in groupsfor safety in numbersand to warn each other about howto avoid dangerous guys.But during a police crackdownon sex workers and their clients,she was forced to work aloneto avoid being arrested.She was stabbed to deathin the early hours of October 29, 2013.She had been working later than usualto try to pay off a fineshe had received for soliciting.So if criminalizingsex workers hurts them,why not just criminalizethe people who buy sex?This is the aim of the third approachI want to talk about â€”the Swedish or Nordicmodel of sex-work law.The idea behind this lawis that selling sexis intrinsically harmfuland so you're, in fact, helpingsex workers by removing the option.Despite growing supportfor what's often describedas the ""end demand"" approach,there's no evidence that it works.There's just as much prostitutionin Sweden as there was before.Why might that be?It's because people selling sexoften don't have other options for income.If you need that money,the only effect that a dropin business is going haveis to force you to lower your pricesor offer more risky sexual services.If you need to find more clients,you might seek the help of a manager.So you see, rather than putting a stopto what's often descried as pimping,a law like this actually gives oxygento potentially abusive third parties.To keep safe in my work,I try not to take bookings from someonewho calls me from a withheld number.If it's a home or a hotel visit,I try to get a full name and details.If I worked under the Swedish model,a client would be too scaredto give me that information.I might have no other choicebut to accept a bookingfrom a man who is untraceableif he later turns out to be violent.If you need their money,you need to protectyour clients from the police.If you work outdoors,that means working aloneor in isolated locations,just as if you were criminalized yourself.It might mean getting into cars quicker,less negotiating timemeans snap decisions.Is this guy dangerous or just nervous?Can you afford to take the risk?Can you afford not to?Something I'm often hearing is,""Prostitution would be fineif we made it legal and regulated it.""We call that approach legalization,and it's used by countrieslike the Netherlands, Germanyand Nevada in the US.But it's not a greatmodel for human rights.And in state-controlled prostitution,commercial sex can only happenin certain legally-designatedareas or venues,and sex workers are made to complywith special restrictions,like registrationand forced health checks.Regulation sounds great on paper,but politicians deliberately makeregulation around the sex industryexpensive and difficult to comply with.It creates a two-tiered system:legal and illegal work.We sometimes call it""backdoor criminalization.""Rich, well-connected brothel ownerscan comply with the regulations,but more marginalized peoplefind those hoopsimpossible to jump through.And even if it's possible in principle,getting a license or proper venuetakes time and costs money.It's not going to be an optionfor someone who's desperateand needs money tonight.They might be a refugeeor fleeing domestic abuse.In this two-tiered system,the most vulnerable peopleare forced to work illegally,so they're still exposed to allthe dangers of criminalizationI mentioned earlier.So.It's looking like all attempts to controlor prevent sex work from happeningmakes things more dangerousfor people selling sex.Fear of law enforcement makes themwork alone in isolated locations,and allows clients and even copsto get abusive in the knowledgethey'll get away with it.Fines and criminal records forcepeople to keep selling sex,rather than enabling them to stop.Crackdowns on buyers drive sellersto take dangerous risksand into the armsof potentially abusive managers.These laws also reinforce stigmaand hatred against sex workers.When France temporarily brought inthe Swedish model two years ago,ordinary citizens took it as a cueto start carrying out vigilante attacksagainst people working on the street.In Sweden, opinion surveys showthat significantly more people wantsex workers to be arrested nowthan before the law was brought in.If prohibition is this harmful,you might ask, why it so popular?Firstly, sex work is and alwayshas been a survival strategyfor all kinds of unpopularminority groups:people of color,migrants,people with disabilities,LGBTQ people,particularly trans women.These are the groups most heavily profiledand punished through prohibitionist law.I don't think this is an accident.These laws have political supportprecisely because they target peoplethat voters don't wantto see or know about.Why else might people support prohibition?Well, lots of people haveunderstandable fears about trafficking.Folks think that foreign womenkidnapped and sold into sexual slaverycan be saved by shuttinga whole industry down.So let's talk about trafficking.Forced labor does occurin many industries,especially those where the workersare migrants or otherwise vulnerable,and this needs to be addressed.But it's best addressed with legislationtargeting those specific abuses,not an entire industry.When 23 undocumented Chinese migrantsdrowned while picking cocklesin Morecambe Bay in 2004,there were no calls to outlawthe entire seafood industryto save trafficking victims.The solution is clearly to giveworkers more legal protections,allowing them to resist abuseand report it to authoritieswithout fear of arrest.The way the term traffickingis thrown aroundimplies that all undocumentedmigration into prostitution is forced.In fact, many migrantshave made a decision,out of economic need,to place themselves into the handsof people smugglers.Many do this with the full knowledgethat they'll be selling sexwhen they reach their destination.And yes, it can often be the casethat these people smugglersdemand exorbitant fees,coerce migrants into workthey don't want to doand abuse them when they're vulnerable.That's true of prostitution,but it's also true of agricultural work,hospitality work and domestic work.Ultimately, nobody wantsto be forced to do any kind of work,but that's a risk many migrantsare willing to take,because of what they're leaving behind.If people were allowed to migrate legallythey wouldn't have to place their livesinto the hands of people smugglers.The problems arisefrom the criminalization of migration,just as they do from the criminalizationof sex work itself.This is a lesson of history.If you try to prohibit somethingthat people want or need to do,whether that's drinking alcoholor crossing bordersor getting an abortionor selling sex,you create more problems than you solve.Prohibition barely makes a differenceto the amount of peopleactually doing those things.But it makes a huge differenceas to whether or notthey're safe when they do them.Why else might people support prohibition?As a feminist, I knowthat the sex industry is a siteof deeply entrenched social inequality.It's a fact that most buyers of sexare men with money,and most sellers are women without.You can agree with all that â€” I do â€”and still think prohibitionis a terrible policy.In a better, more equal world,maybe there would be far fewerpeople selling sex to survive,but you can't simply legislatea better world into existence.If someone needs to sell sexbecause they're pooror because they're homelessor because they're undocumentedand they can't find legal work,taking away that optiondoesn't make them any less pooror house themor change their immigration status.People worry that sellingsex is degrading.Ask yourself: is it more degradingthan going hungryor seeing your children go hungry?There's no call to ban rich peoplefrom hiring nanniesor getting manicures,even though most of the peopledoing that labor are poor, migrant women.It's the fact of poor migrant womenselling sex specificallythat has some feminists uncomfortable.And I can understandwhy the sex industry provokesstrong feelings.People have all kindsof complicated feelingswhen it comes to sex.But we can't make policyon the basis of mere feelings,especially not overthe heads of the peopleactually effected by those policies.If we get fixated onthe abolition of sex work,we end up worrying moreabout a particular manifestationof gender inequality,rather than about the underlying causes.People get really hung up on the question,""Well, would you wantyour daughter doing it?""That's the wrong question.Instead, imagine she is doing it.How safe is she at work tonight?Why isn't she safer?So we've looked at full criminalization,partial criminalization,the Swedish or Nordic Modeland legalization,and how they all cause harm.Something I never hear asked is:""What do sex workers want?""After all, we're the onesmost affected by these laws.New Zealand decriminalizedsex work in 2003.It's crucial to rememberthat decriminalization and legalizationare not the same thing.Decriminalization meansthe removal of lawsthat punitively target the sex industry,instead treating sex workmuch like any other kind of work.In New Zealand, peoplecan work together for safety,and employers of sex workersare accountable to the state.A sex worker can refuseto see a client at any time,for any reason,and 96 percent of street workersreport that they feel the lawprotects their rights.New Zealand hasn't actuallyseen an increasein the amount of people doing sex work,but decriminalizing ithas made it a lot safer.But the lesson from New Zealandisn't just that its particularlegislation is good,but that crucially,it was written in collaborationwith sex workers;namely, the New ZealandProstitutes' Collective.When it came to making sex work safer,they were ready to hear it straightfrom sex workers themselves.Here in the UK,I'm part of sex worker-led groupslike the Sex Worker Open Universityand the English Collective of Prostitutes.And we form part of a global movementdemanding decriminalizationand self-determination.The universal symbol of our movementis the red umbrella.We're supported in our demandsby global bodies like UNAIDS,the World Health Organizationand Amnesty International.But we need more allies.If you care about gender equalityor poverty or migration or public health,then sex worker rights matter to you.Make space for us in your movements.That means not only listeningto sex workers when we speakbut amplifying our voices.Resist those who silence us,those who say that a prostituteis either too victimized,too damaged to knowwhat's best for herself,or else too privilegedand too removed from real hardship,not representative of the millionsof voiceless victims.This distinction between victimand empowered is imaginary.It exists purely to discredit sex workersand make it easy to ignore us.No doubt many of you work for a living.Well, sex work is work, too.Just like you,some of us like our jobs,some of us hate them.Ultimately, most of ushave mixed feelings.But how we feel about our workisn't the point.And how others feelabout our work certainly isn't.What's important is that we havethe right to work safelyand on our own terms.Sex workers are real people.We've had complicated experiencesand complicated responsesto those experiences.But our demands are not complicated.You can ask expensiveescorts in New York City,brothel workers in Cambodia,street workers in South Africaand every girl on the rosterat my old job in Soho,and they will all tell you the same thing.You can speak to millions of sex workersand countless sex work-led organizations.We want full decriminalizationand labor rights as workers.I'm just one sex workeron the stage today,but I'm bringing a messagefrom all over the world.Thank you.(Applause)"
