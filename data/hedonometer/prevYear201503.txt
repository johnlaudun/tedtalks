I had brain surgery    years ago  and since that time  brain science has become a personal passion of mine. I'm actually an engineer. And first let me say  I recently joined Google's Moonshot group  where I had a division  the display division in Google X  and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I joined Google and on the side outside of Google. So that said  there's a stigma when you have brain surgery. Are you still smart or not  And if not  can you make yourself smart again  After my neurosurgery  part of my brain was missing  and I had to deal with that. It wasn't the grey matter  but it  was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters. Immediately after my surgery  I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day  because if I just took nothing  I would die within hours. Every day now for    years    every single day    I've had to try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals  and try to get them  to stay alive. There have been several close calls. But luckily  I'm an experimentalist at heart  so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn't a clear road map on this that's detailed. I began to try different mixtures  and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self  my sense of who I was  my thinking  my behavior towards people. One particularly dramatic case  for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early   s  and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed. I was angry all the time  I thought about sex constantly  and I thought I was the smartest person in the entire world  and   Laughter   of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that  or maybe kind of toned down versions of that. I was kind of extreme. But to me  the surprise was  I wasn't trying to be arrogant. I was actually trying  with a little bit of insecurity  to actually fix a problem in front of me  and it just didn't come out that way. So I couldn't handle it. I changed my dosages. But that experience  I think  gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through  and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then. What I was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery  my creative thought  my idea flow. And I think mostly in images  and so for me that became a key metric    how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping  if you will  my ideas  trying on different new ideas for size  playing out scenarios. This kind of thinking isn't new. Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes saw things similarly. They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing. There are those today that dispute that  and lots of debates about how the mind works  but for me it's simple  Mental images  for most of us  are central in inventive and creative thinking. So after several years  I tuned myself up and I have lots of great  really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them. And so now I'm working on  how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster  Can you imagine  if you will  a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her  Or a musician to get the music out of his head  There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed. And the truth is  the remaining bottleneck in being able to do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems. So let me show you why I think  we're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups. Both used fMRI technology    functional magnetic resonance imaging technology    to image the brain  and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues at Harvard. And the left hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image. The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining  seeing that same image. And the right column was created by subtracting the middle  column from the left column  showing the difference to be nearly zero. This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images  always with a similar result. The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing. Next let me share with you one other experiment  this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley. They've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields. So let me set this up for you. In this experiment  individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences. Then a new movie was shown with new images  new people  new animals in it  and a new scan set was recorded. The computer  using brain scan data alone  decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the  individual was actually seeing. On the right hand side  you see the computer's guess  and on the left hand side  the presented clip. This is the jaw dropper. We are so close to being able to do this. We just need to up the resolution. And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image  it creates the same brain scan. So this was done with the highest resolution brain scan systems available today  and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years. Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse. How do we do that  There's a lot of techniques in this approach. One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes. I'm not for that. There's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed  some even by me  but given the recent success of MRI  first we need to ask the question  is it the end of the road with this technology  Conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets  but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements  not the thousandfold we need. I'm putting forward an idea  instead of bigger magnets  let's make better magnets. There's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets  and with these magnets  we can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain  and using those  we can actually create holographic like interference structures to get precision control over many patterns  as is shown here by shifting things. We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrangements  kind of like making Spirograph. So why does that matter  A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big  really huge magnets  right  But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the MRI systems. Let's also  instead of a uniform magnetic field  put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies. So by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan. And on top of that  we can then layer our ever growing knowledge  of brain structure and memory to create a thousandfold increase that we need. And using fMRI  we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow  but the hormones and neurotransmitters  I've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity  which is the dream. We're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media. Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought  What would we be capable of then  And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought  You think the Internet was big. These are huge questions. It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills. And indeed  this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases. We have little option but to open this door. Regardless  pick a year    will it happen in five years or    years  It's hard to imagine it taking much longer. We need to learn how to take this step together. Thank you. I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology. We tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought  perhaps rather timeless. I'm going to argue that  in fact  business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology  that those assumptions are changing  and  in fact  changing quite dramatically  and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy. Let me start  if I may  with a little bit of history. The idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants  Bruce Henderson  the founder of BCG  and Michael Porter  professor at the Harvard Business School. Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness  of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that  in the business world  there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns    scale  experience. The more you do of something  disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. Porter agreed with that premise  but he qualified it. He pointed out  correctly  that that's all very well  but businesses actually have multiple steps to them. They have different components  and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy. A company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others. He formed the concept of the value chain  essentially the sequence of steps with which a  shall we say  raw material  becomes a component  becomes assembled into a finished product  and then is distributed  for example  and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components  and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average of that of its parts. And this idea of the value chain was predicated on the recognition that what holds a business together is transaction costs  that in essence you need to coordinate  organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets  very often  and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs. It was on those two ideas  Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience  and Porter's idea of the value chain  encompassing heterogenous elements  that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected. Now what I'm going to argue is that those premises are  in fact  being invalidated. First of all  let's think about transaction costs. There are really two components to transaction costs. One is about processing information  and the other is about communication. These are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time. As we all know from so many contexts  they have been radically transformed since the days when Porter and Henderson first formulated their theories. In particular  since the mid '  s  communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs  which is why communication  the Internet  has exploded in such a dramatic fashion. Now  those falling transaction costs have profound consequences  because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together  and they are falling  there is less to economize on. There is less need for vertically integrated organization  and value chains at least can break up. They needn't necessarily  but they can. In particular  it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another. That is not just an abstract proposition. There are many very specific stories of how that actually happened. A poster child example was the encyclopedia business. The encyclopedia business in the days of leatherbound books was basically a distribution business. Most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen. The CD ROM and then the Internet came along  new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper  and the encyclopedia industry collapsed. It's now  of course  a very familiar story. This  in fact  more generally was the story of the first generation of the Internet economy. It was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation  or what we call deconstruction. One of the questions I was occasionally asked was  well  what's going to replace the encyclopedia when Britannica no longer has a business model  And it was a while before the answer became manifest. Now  of course  we know what it is  it's the Wikipedia. Now what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution. What's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced. The Wikipedia  of course  is an encyclopedia created by its users. And this  in fact  defines what you might call the second decade of the Internet economy  the decade in which the Internet as a noun became the Internet as a verb. It became a set of conversations  the era in which user generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon. Now what that really meant in terms of the Porter Henderson framework was the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale. It turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job  and certainly a much cheaper job  than professionals in a hierarchical organization. So basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented  as individuals could take over where organizations were no longer needed. But there's another question that obviously this graph poses  which is  okay  we've gone through two decades    does anything distinguish the third  And what I'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third  and it maps exactly on to the kind of Porter Henderson logic that we've been talking about. And that is  about data. If we go back to around       a lot of people were talking about the information revolution  and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data was growing  indeed growing quite fast. but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog. We go forward to       not only had the world's stock of data exploded  but there'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog. And more important even than that  if you look more carefully at this graph  what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is information that has an I.P. address. It's on a server or it's on a P.C. But having an I.P. address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an I.P. address. It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world's knowledge in order to see patterns  an entirely new thing. If we run the numbers forward to today  it probably looks something like this. We're not really sure. If we run the numbers forward to       we of course have an exact number  courtesy of IDC. It's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present. And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication in the stock of information that is connected via an I.P. address. Now  if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points  a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data  this just in the last    or    years. This  I would submit  is a sea change  a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in. The first human genome  that of James Watson  was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year       and it took about     million dollars and about    years of work to map just one person's genomic makeup. Since then  the costs of mapping the genome have come down. In fact  they've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed  to the point where the cost  is now below       dollars  and it's confidently predicted that by the year      it will be below     dollars    a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a    year period  an extraordinary phenomenon. Now  in the days when mapping a genome cost millions  or even tens of thousands  it was basically a research enterprise. Scientists would gather some representative people  and they would see patterns  and they would try and make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they find from these particular selected individuals. But when the genome can  be mapped for     bucks     dollars while you wait  then what happens is  it becomes retail. It becomes above all clinical. You go the doctor with a cold  and if he or she hasn't done it already  the first thing they do is map your genome  at which point what they're now doing is not starting from some abstract  knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you  but they're starting from your particular genome. Now think of the power of that. Think of where that takes us when we can combine genomic data with clinical data with data about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical sensors will increasingly be collecting. Think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before. This  I would suggest  perhaps it will take a while  but this will drive a revolution in medicine. Fabulous  lots of people talk about this. But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention. How is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases compatible with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved in this business today  If your business is based on proprietary data  if your competitive advantage is defined by your data  how on Earth is that company or is that society in fact going to achieve the value that's implicit in the technology  They can't. So essentially what's happening here  and genomics is merely one example of this  is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it  and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated. The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated  oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving  by one means or another  from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening  It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together  and allows them to separate. The polarization of scale economies towards the very small    small is beautiful    allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production. The scaling in the opposite direction  towards things like big data  drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve that scale. But either way  the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal. The logic isn't just about big data. If we were to look  for example  at the telecommunications industry  you can tell the same story about fiber optics. If we look at the pharmaceutical industry  or  for that matter  university research  you can say exactly the same story about so called  big science.  And in the opposite direction  if we look  say  at the energy sector  where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient conservers of energy  that is  in fact  the reverse phenomenon. That is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale. Either way  what we are driven to is this horizontalization of the structure of industries  and that implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy. It means  for example  that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure  where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy  not something that the strategy presupposes. It means  for example  we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously. Think about the genome. We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously. And we need industry structures that will accommodate very  very different motivations  from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments  or  for that matter  cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing  because that is the only way that they can get to scale. These kinds of transformations render the traditional premises  of business strategy obsolete. They drive us into a completely new world. They require us  whether we are in the public sector or the private sector  to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business  and  at last  it makes strategy interesting again. Thank you. The      Arab Spring captured the attention of the world. It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries  who were worried that revolution would spread. To respond  they ramped up surveillance of activists  journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries. One prominent Bahraini activist  who was arrested and tortured by his government  has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages. Of course  it's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages. It's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone. Instead  they use tools like Skype  which they think are immune to interception. They're wrong. There have now been over the last few years an industry of companies who provide surveillance technology to governments  specifically technology that allows those governments to hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Rather than intercepting the communications  as they go over the wire  instead they now hack into your computer  enable your webcam  enable your microphone  and steal documents from your computer. When the government of Egypt fell in       activists raided the office of the secret police  and among the many documents they found was this document by the Gamma Corporation  by Gamma International. Gamma is a German company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments. It's important to note that most governments don't really have the in house capabilities to develop this software. Smaller ones don't have the resources or the expertise  and so there's this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price. Gamma is just one of these companies. I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government. They'd sent them an invoice for a sale  but the Egyptians never bought it. Instead  apparently  the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma's software. So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced. Really  they're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it's going on. You know  your webcam light won't turn on. There's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled. This is the managing director of Gamma International. His name is Martin Muench. There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist. This is perhaps my favorite. I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam. You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera. He knows what kind of surveillance is possible  and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used against him. Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles. Of course  he's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments  he has no way of knowing how it can be used. Gamma's software has been located on servers in countries around the world  many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations. They really are selling their software around the world. Gamma is not the only company in the business. As I said  it's a    billion industry. One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team. Now  Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation. The video they've produced is very sexy  and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients. You have to hack your target.   While your target is browsing the web  exchanging documents  receiving SMS  crossing the borders   You have to hit many different platforms.   Windows  OS X  iOS  Android  Blackberry  Symbian  Linux   You have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data.  Skype   encrypted calls  target location   messaging  relationships  web browsing  audio   video   Being stealth and untraceable.   Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure   Deployed all over your country.   Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot   Exactly what we do. Christopher Soghoian  So  it would be funny if it wasn't true  but  in fact  Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world. Last year we learned  for example  that it's been used to target Moroccan  journalists by the Moroccan government. Many  many countries it's been found in. So  Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market. In the last year or so  the company has opened a sales office in Maryland. The company has also hired a spokesperson. They've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up. They've spoken at the conferences. What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team has sold their technology in the United States  but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it  it isn't because they haven't been trying hard. So as I said before  governments that don't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off the shelf surveillance software  and so for that reason  you see that the government of  say  Tunisia  might use the same software as the government of Germany. They're all buying off the shelf stuff. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology  and so for several years  I've been trying to figure out if and how the FBI is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets. My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation    they're a civil society group   obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. Most of these documents were heavily redacted  but what you can see from the slides  if I zoom in  is this term  Remote Operations Unit. Now  when I first looked into this  I'd never heard of this unit before. I've been studying surveillance for more than six years. I'd never heard of it. And so I went online and I did some research  and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn  the social networking site for job seekers. There were lots of former U.S. government contractors who had at one point worked for the Remote Operating Unit  and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs what they had done in their former job. So I took this information and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal  and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes  in fact  the FBI has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Like Gamma and Hacking Team  the FBI also has the capability to remotely activate webcams  microphones  steal documents  get web browsing information  the works. There's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking  and that's that terrorists  pedophiles  drug dealers  journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers. There's no drug dealer phone and there's no journalist laptop. We all use the same technology  and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys  they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too. So governments around the world have been embracing this technology. They've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique  but without any real debate. In the United States  where I live  there have been no congressional hearings. There's no law that's been passed specifically authorizing this technique  and because of its power and potential for abuse  it's vital that we have an informed public debate. Thank you very much. This is a vending machine in Los Angeles. It's in a shopping mall  and it sells fish eggs. It's a caviar vending machine. This is the Art o mat  an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists  usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes  in limited edition. This is Oliver Medvedik. He's not a vending machine  but he is one of the founders of Genspace  a community biolab in Brooklyn  New York  where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA. In fact  I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago  and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now. Because strawberry DNA is really  fascinating  because it's so beautiful. I'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before  before I saw it in this form. And a lot of people  especially in the art community  don't necessarily engage in science in this way. I instantly joined Genspace after this  and I asked Oliver   Well  if we can do this strawberries  can we do this with people as well   And about    minutes later  we were both spinning it in vials together and coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction. And I started doing this on my own  and this is what my DNA actually looks like. And I was at a dinner party with some friends  some artist friends  and I was telling them about this project  and they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA. So I said  all right  let's get out some supplies right now. And I started having these bizarre dinner  parties at my house on Friday nights where people would come over and we would do DNA extractions  and I would actually capture them on video  because it created this kind of funny portrait as well. These are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever. You can kind of tell from their reactions. But they became fascinated by it  and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science. And so I started doing this regularly. It's kind of an odd thing to do with your Friday nights  but this is what I started doing  and I started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials and categorizing them. This is what that looked like. And it started to make me think about a couple of things. First of all  this looked a lot like my Facebook wall. So in a way  I've created sort of a genetic network  a genetic social network  really. And the second thing was  one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like   Oh. Why are they numbered  Is this person more rare than the other one   And I hadn't even thought about that. They were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in. But that made me think about collecting toys  and this thing that's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys  and being able to collect these rare toys. You buy these boxes. You're not sure what's going to be inside of them. But then  when you open them up  you have different rarities of the toys. And so I thought that was interesting. I started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art o mat all together  and some reason  I was one night drawing a vending machine  thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine  and the little vial of my DNA was sitting there  and I saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine. And so  of course  I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine. Here it is.   DNA Vending Machine is an art installation about our increasing access to biotechnology.     For a reasonable cost  you can purchase a sample of human DNA from a traditional vending machine.     Each sample comes packaged with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.     DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.   Gabriel Garcia Colombo  So the DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple galleries in New York  and it's selling out pretty well  actually. We're in the first edition of     pieces  hoping to do another edition pretty soon. I'd actually like to get it into more of a metro hub  like Grand Central or Penn Station  right next to some of the other  actual  vending machines in that location. But really with this project and a lot of my art projects I want to ask the audience a question  and that is  when biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as  say  laser cutting or  D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine  will you still submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine  And how much will these samples be worth  And will you buy someone else's sample  And what will you be able to do with that sample  Thank you. The year is     . A curious little invention is being talked about. It's called a microscope. What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye. Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases. Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup  not very far from here. This is from London. Fast forward     years. We still have this monster soup around  and it's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt. Just for malaria itself  there are a million deaths a year  and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections. Now it's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters. You take a stain  like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa  and a microscope  and you look at them. They all have faces. Why is that so  that Alex in Kenya  Fatima in Bangladesh  Navjoot in Mumbai  and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick  And that's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach. And remember that number  one billion. The problem lies with the microscope itself. Even though the pinnacle of modern science  research microscopes are not designed for field testing. Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all. They are heavy  bulky  really hard to maintain  and cost a lot of money. This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '  s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India. Two of my students  Jim and James  traveled around India and Thailand  starting to think about this problem a lot. We saw all kinds of donated equipment. We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses. And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on. What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes. So what is a Foldscope  A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope  a platform for fluorescence  bright field  polarization  projection  all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper. So  now you think  how is that possible  I'm going to show you some examples here  and we will run through some of them. It starts with a single sheet of paper. What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright field and fluorescence microscope. So  there are three stages  There is the optical stage  the illumination stage and the mask holding stage. And there are micro optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself. What you do is  you take it on  and just like you are playing like a toy  which it is  I tab it off  and I break it off. This paper has no instructions and no languages. There is a code  a color code embedded  that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope. When it's done  it looks something like this  has all the functionalities of a standard microscope  just like an XY stage  a place where a sample slide could go  for example right here. We didn't want to change this  because this is the standard that's been optimized for over the years  and many health workers are actually used to this. So this is what changes  but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases. You pop this in. There is an XY stage  and then there is a focusing stage  which is a flexure mechanism that's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps. So what's really interesting about this object  and my students hate when I do this  but I'm going to do this anyway  is these are rugged devices. I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it. And they last  even though they're designed from a very flexible material  like paper. Another fun fact is  this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool  but here in this envelope I have    different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder. And I'm going to pick one randomly. This one  it turns out  is actually designed specifically for malaria  because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria. So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this. So up till now  you didn't actually see what I would see from one of these setups. So what I would like to do is  if we could dim the lights  please  it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes. I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn    go to the back of the wall    and just project  and this way you will see exactly what I would see. What you're looking at    This is a cross section of a compound eye  and when I'm going to zoom in closer  right there  I am going through the z axis. You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross section pattern. Another example  one of my favorite insects  I love to hate this one  is a mosquito  and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens. Right there. All from the simple setup that I actually described. So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer. So it turns out they're waterproof  and    right here is just fluorescent water  and I don't know if you can actually see this. This also shows you how  the projection scope works. You get to see the beam the  way it's projected and bent. Can we get the lights back on again  So I'm quickly going to show you  since I'm running out of time  in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture  the biggest idea was roll to roll manufacturing  so we built this out of    cents of parts and costs. And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy  which we call use and throw microscopy. I'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in. Here is a sheet of paper. This is when we were thinking about the idea. This is an A  sheet of paper. These are the three stages that you actually see. And the optical components  if you look at the inset up on the right  we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs  so it uses a process of self assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself. So that's where the lenses go. There are some light sources. And essentially  in the end  all the parts line up because of origami  because of the fact that origami allows us micron scale precision of optical alignment. So even though this looks like a simple toy  the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated. So here is another obvious thing that we would do  typically  if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust  is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself. There it is  and it survives. So for us  the next step actually is really finishing our field trials. We are starting at the end of the summer. We are at a stage where we'll be  making thousands of microscopes. That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place. We've started collecting data for malaria  Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves. And I want to leave you with this picture. I had not anticipated this before  but a really interesting link between hands on science education and global health. What are the tools that we're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow  I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets. Thank you. I work with children with autism. Specifically  I make technologies to help them communicate. Now  many of the problems that children with autism face  they have a common source  and that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction  symbolism. And because of this  they have  a lot of difficulty with language. Let me tell you a little bit about why this is. You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup. All of us can see it. All of us understand this. These are two other pictures of soup  but you can see that these are more abstract These are not quite as concrete. And when you get to language  you see that it becomes a word whose look  the way it looks and the way it sounds  has absolutely nothing to do  with what it started with  or what it represents  which is the bowl of soup. So it's essentially a completely abstract  a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world  and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount of difficulty with. Now that's why most of the people  that work with children with autism    speech therapists  educators    what they do is  they try to help children with autism communicate not with words  but with pictures. So if a child with autism wanted to say   I want soup   that child would pick three different pictures   I    want   and  soup   and they would put these together  and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say. And this has been incredibly effective  for the last        years people have been doing this. In fact  a few years back  I developed an app for the iPad which does exactly this. It's called Avaz  and the way it works is that kids select different pictures. These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences  and these sentences are spoken out. So Avaz is essentially converting pictures  it's a translator  it converts pictures into speech. Now  this was very effective. There are thousands of children using this  you know  all over the world  and I started thinking about what it does and what it doesn't do. And I realized something interesting  Avaz helps children with autism learn words. What it doesn't help them do is to learn word patterns. Let me explain this in a little more detail. Take this sentence   I want soup tonight.  Now it's not just the words here that convey the meaning. It's also the way in which these words are arranged  the way these words are modified and arranged. And that's why a sentence like  I want soup tonight  is different from a sentence like  Soup want I tonight   which  is completely meaningless. So there is another hidden abstraction here which children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with  and that's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings  to convey different ideas. Now  this is what we call grammar. And grammar is incredibly powerful  because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information  an infinite amount of ideas. It's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to. And so after I developed Avaz  I worried for a very long time about how I could give grammar  to children with autism. The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective. I happened to chance upon a child with autism conversing with her mom  and this is what happened. Completely out of the blue  very spontaneously  the child got up and said   Eat.  Now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions. So she asked   Eat what  Do  you want to eat ice cream  You want to eat  Somebody else wants to eat  You want to eat cream now  You want to eat ice cream in the evening   And then it struck me that what the mother had done was something incredible. She had been able to get that child to communicate an idea to her without grammar. And it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for. Instead of arranging words in an order  in sequence  as a sentence  you arrange them in this map  where they're all linked together not by placing them one after the other but in questions  in question answer pairs. And so if you do this  then what you're conveying is not a sentence in English  but what you're conveying is really a meaning  the meaning of a sentence in English. Now  meaning is really the underbelly  in some sense  of language. It's what comes after thought but before language. And the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form. So I was very excited by this  you know  hopping around all over the place  trying to figure out if I can convert all possible sentences that I hear into this. And I found that this is not enough. Why is this not enough  This is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation  you want to say   I don't want soup   then you can't do that by asking a question. You do that by changing the word  want.  Again  if you wanted to say   I wanted soup yesterday   you do that by converting the word  want  into  wanted.  It's a past tense. So this is a flourish which I added to make the system complete. This is a map of words joined together as questions and answers  and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances. Let me show you this with a different example. Let's take this sentence   I told the carpenter I could not pay him.  It's a fairly complicated sentence. The way that this particular system works  you can start with any part of this sentence. I'm going to start with the word  tell.  So this is the word  tell.  Now this happened in the past  so I'm going to make that  told.  Now  what I'm going to do is  I'm going to ask questions. So  who told  I told. I told whom  I told the carpenter. Now we start with a different part of the sentence. We start with the word  pay   and we add the ability filter to it to make it  can pay.  Then we make it  can't pay   and we can make it  couldn't pay  by making it the past tense. So who couldn't pay  I couldn't pay. Couldn't pay whom  I couldn't pay the carpenter. And then you join these two together by asking this question  What did I tell the carpenter  I told the carpenter I could not pay him. Now think about this. This is   Applause   this is a representation of this sentence without language. And there are two or three interesting things about this. First of all  I could have started anywhere. I didn't have to start with the word  tell.  I could have started anywhere in the sentence  and I could have made this entire thing. The second thing is  if I wasn't an English speaker  if I was speaking in some other language  this map would actually hold true in any language. So long as the questions are standardized  the map is actually independent of language. So I call this FreeSpeech  and I was playing with this for many  many months. I was trying out so many different combinations of this. And then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech. I was trying to convert language  convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech  and vice versa  and back and forth. And I realized that this particular configuration  this particular way of representing language  it allowed me to actually create very concise rules that go between FreeSpeech on one side and English on the other. So I could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into English. And so I developed this thing. I developed this thing called  the FreeSpeech Engine which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input and gives out perfectly grammatical English text. And by putting these two pieces together  the representation and the engine  I was able to create an app  a technology for children with autism  that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar. So I tried this out with kids with autism  and I found that there was an  incredible amount of identification. They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in English  and I started thinking about why that might be the case. And I had an idea  and I want to  talk to you about this idea next. In about       about    years back  there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language  and they found something very interesting. They found that when you learn a language as a child  as a two year old  you learn it with a certain part of your brain  and when you learn a language as an adult    for example  if I wanted to learn Japanese right now   a completely different part of my brain is used. Now I don't know why that's the case  but my guess is that that's because when you learn a language as an adult  you almost invariably learn it through your native language  or through your first language. So what's interesting about FreeSpeech is that when you create a sentence or when you create language  a child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech  they're not using this support language  they're not using this bridge language. They're directly constructing the sentence. And so this gave me this idea. Is it possible to use FreeSpeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities  And so I tried a number of experiments. The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes  in the form of colors  and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works. And I built an app out of it  a game out of it  in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement  a sound reinforcement of visual structures  they're able to learn language. And this  this has a lot of potential  a lot of promise  and the government of India recently licensed this technology from us  and they're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them English. And the dream  the hope  the vision  really  is that when they learn English this way  they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue. All right  let's talk about something else. Let's talk about speech. This is speech. So speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us. Now what's interesting about speech is that speech is one dimensional. Why is it one dimensional  It's one dimensional because it's sound. It's also one dimensional because our mouths are built that way. Our mouths are built to create one dimensional sound. But if you think about the brain  the thoughts that we have in our heads are not one dimensional. I mean  we have these rich  complicated  multi dimensional ideas. Now  it seems to me that language is really the brain's invention to convert this rich  multi dimensional thought on one hand into speech on the other hand. Now what's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays  and almost all of that is done in the language domain. Take Google  for example. Google trawls all these countless billions of websites  all of which are in English  and when you want to use Google  you go into Google search  and you type in English  and it matches the English with the English. What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead  I have a suspicion that if we did this  we'd find that algorithms like searching  like retrieval  all of these things  are much simpler and also more effective  because they don't process the data structure of speech. Instead they're processing the data structure of thought. The data structure of thought. That's a provocative idea. But let's look at this in a little more detail. So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem. We have the Free Speech representation on one side  and we have the FreeSpeech  Engine  which generates English. Now if you think about it  FreeSpeech  I told you  is completely  language independent. It doesn't have any specific information in it which is about English. So everything that this system knows about English is actually encoded into the engine. That's a pretty interesting concept in itself. You've encoded an entire human language into a software program. But if you look at what's inside the engine  it's actually not very complicated. It's not very complicated code. And what's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English specific. And that gives this interesting idea. It might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many  many different languages  in Hindi  in French  in German  in Swahili. And that gives another interesting idea. For example  supposing I was a writer  say  for a newspaper or for a magazine. I could create content in one language  FreeSpeech  and the person who's consuming that content  the person who's reading that particular information could choose any engine  and they could read it in their own mother tongue  in their native language. I mean  this is an incredibly attractive idea  especially for India. We have so many different languages. There's a song about India  and there's a description of the country as  it says  That means  ever smiling speaker of beautiful languages.  Language is beautiful. I think it's the most beautiful of human creations. I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented. It entertains  it educates  it enlightens  but what I like the most about language is that it empowers. I want to leave you with this. This is a photograph of my collaborators  my earliest collaborators when I started working on language and autism and various other things. The girl's name is Pavna  and that's her mother  Kalpana. And Pavna's an entrepreneur  but her story is much more remarkable than mine  because Pavna is about   . She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy  so ever since she was born  she could neither move nor talk. And everything that she's accomplished so far  finishing school  going to college  starting a company  collaborating with me to develop Avaz  all of these things she's done with nothing more than moving her eyes. Daniel Webster said this  He said   If all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception  I would choose to keep the power of communication  for with it  I would regain all the rest.  And that's why  of all of these incredible  applications of FreeSpeech  the one that's closest to my heart still remains the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate  the power of communication  to get back all the rest. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So my moment of truth did not come all at once. In       I had the chance to be considered for promotion from my job as director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department. This was my moment to lean in  to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs  and I had just finished a big     month project for Secretary Clinton  successfully  and I knew I could handle a bigger job. The woman I thought I was would have said yes. But I had been commuting for two years between Washington and Princeton  New Jersey  where my husband and my two teenage sons lived  and it was not going well. I tried on the idea of eking out another two years in Washington  or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me. But deep down  I knew that the right decision was to go home  even if I didn't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice. That was a decision based on love and responsibility. I couldn't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me. But the real change came more gradually. Over the next year  while my family was righting itself  I started to realize that even if I could go back into government  I didn't want to. I didn't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at home. I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me  not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want  and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed. I am still completely committed to the cause of male female equality  but let's think about what that equality really means  and how best to achieve it. I always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers  so that the measure of male female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions  prime ministers  presidents  CEOs  directors  managers  Nobel laureates  leaders. I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal. But that's only half of real equality  and I now think we're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half. I suggest that real equality  full equality  does not just mean valuing women on male terms. It means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and for men. And to get there  we have to change our workplaces  our policies and our culture. In the workplace  real equality means valuing family just as much as work  and understanding that the two reinforce each other. As a leader and as a manager  I have always acted on the mantra  if family comes first  work does not come second    life comes together. If you work for me  and you have a family issue  I expect you to attend to it  and I am confident  and my confidence has always been borne out  that the work will get done  and done better. Workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused  more efficient  more results focused. And breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts. Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents. He's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office. And caregiving itself develops patience    a lot of patience    and empathy  creativity  resilience  adaptability. Those are all attributes that are ever more important in a high speed  horizontal  networked global economy. The best companies actually know this. The companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the United States include some of our most successful corporations  and a      national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work  they're more satisfied and more loyal  they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health. And a      study of employers showed that deep  flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy. So you may think that the privileging of work over family is only an American problem. Sadly  though  the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely American disease. Twenty years ago  when my family first started going to Italy  we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta. Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day. It's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch. Now  when we go  fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta  reflecting the advance of global corporations and    hour competition. So making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative. In policy terms  real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done  no matter who does it. Think about it  Breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival. At least if we get beyond a barter economy  somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance for loved ones. Now most of you  when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving  instinctively translate those categories into men's work and women's work. And we don't typically challenge why men's work is advantaged. But consider a same sex couple like my friends Sarah and Emily. They're psychiatrists. They got married five years ago  and now they have two year old twins. They love being mothers  but they also love their work  and they're really good at what they do. So how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities  Should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home  Or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules  And what criteria should they use to make that decision  Is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career  Or who has the most flexible boss  The same sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women's problems  they're family problems. And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones  because they have a choice about how much they want to work. Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need  and many of those workers are scrambling. They're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe. If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal  then why shouldn't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy  The governments that get it    no surprises here    the governments that get it  Norway  Sweden  Denmark  the Netherlands  provide universal child care  support for caregivers at home  school and early childhood education  protections for pregnant women  and care for the elderly and the disabled. Those governments invest in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains. Those societies also show you that breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other. They routinely rank among the top    countries of the most globally competitive economies  but at the same time  they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index. In fact  they rank higher than other governments  like my own  the U.S.  or Switzerland  that have higher average levels of income but lower rankings on work life balance. So changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference  but we're not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture  and the kind of cultural change required means re socializing men. Increasingly in developed countries  women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home  but men are actually still where they always were. Men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners  that to derive their self worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder. The feminist revolution still has a long way to go. It's certainly not complete. But    years after  The Feminine Mystique  was published  many women actually have more choices than men do. We can decide to be a breadwinner  a caregiver  or any combination of the two. When a man  on the other hand  decides to be a caregiver  he puts his manhood on the line. His friends may praise his decision  but underneath  they're scratching their heads. Isn't the measure of a man his willingness to compete with other men for power and prestige  And as many women hold that view as men do. We know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career. A woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner. For a man  that's a risky proposition. So as parents and partners  we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be whatever they want to be  either caregivers or breadwinners. We should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys. I can almost hear lots of you thinking   No way.  But in fact  the change is  actually already happening. At least in the United States  lots of men take pride in cooking  and frankly obsess over stoves. They are in the birthing rooms. They take paternity leave when they can. They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can  and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework. Indeed  there are male college students now who are starting to say   I want to be a stay at home dad.  That was completely unthinkable    or even    years ago. And in Norway  where men have an automatic three month's paternity leave  but they lose it if they decide not to take it  a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact take their leave when they had kids. That means that it's starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father. So I was raised to believe that championing women's rights meant doing everything we could to get women to the top. And I still hope that I live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force. But I've come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work  and that we should entertain the idea that doing right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do. Thirty years ago  Carol Gilligan  a wonderful psychologist  studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care  an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice. It turns out that  you don't care  is just as much a part of who we are as  that's not fair.  Bill Gates agrees. He argues that the two great forces of human nature are self interest and caring for others. Let's bring them both together. Let's make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution. As whole human beings  we will be better caregivers and breadwinners. You may think that can't happen  but I grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties  where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms  and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual. Today  not so much. The revolution for human equality can happen. It is happening. It will happen. How far and how fast is up to us. Thank you. Let me start by asking you a question  just with a show of hands  Who has an iPhone  Who has an Android phone  Who has a Blackberry  Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry  And let me guess  how many of you  when you arrived here  like me  went and bought a pay as you go SIM card  Yeah  I'll bet you didn't even know you're using African technology. Pay as you go was a technology  or an idea  pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom a good    years ago  and now  like franchising  pay as you go is one of the most dominant forces of economic activity in the world. So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa  which I think is the purest form  innovation out of necessity. But first  I'm going to ask you some other questions. You don't have to put your hands up. These are rhetorical. Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent the alternating current that powers the lights in this building or the city that we're in  Why did Henry Ford have to invent the production line to produce these Fords that came in anything as long as they were black  And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos  Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like  and in the background  you can see Robben Island. This is a small dolos  and Eric Merrifield is the most famous inventor you've never heard of. In       a storm ripped up the harbor in a small South African town called East London  and while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse  he had the idea for this. It's a bit like a huge jumping jack  and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater. The global shipping economy would not be possible without African technology like this. So whenever you talk about Africa  you have to put up this picture of the world from space  and people go   Look  it's the Dark Continent.  Actually  it isn't. What it is is a map of innovation. And it's really easy to see where innovation's going on. All the places with lots of electricity  it isn't. And the reason it isn't is because everybody's watching television or playing Angry Birds. So where it's happening is in Africa. Now  this is real innovation  not the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching new products. This is real innovation  and I define it as problem solving. People are solving real problems in Africa. Why  Because we have to. Because we have real problems. And when we solve real problems for people  we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time. So in California  everybody's really excited about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone and you can swipe your credit card  and people say   We've liberated the credit card from the point of sale terminal.  Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card  In Africa  we've been doing that for years  and we've been doing it on phones like this. This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela  about an hour south of Nairobi  and the thing that's so remarkable about the payment system that's been pioneered in Africa called M Pesa is that it works on phones like this. It works on every single phone possible  because it uses SMS. You can pay bills with it   you can buy your groceries  you can pay your kids' school fees  and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials. Something like    million dollars a day is transacted through M Pesa. Forty percent of Kenya's GDP moves through M Pesa using phones like this. And you think this is just a feature phone. Actually it's the smartphone of Africa. It's also a radio  and it's also a torch  and more than anything else  it has really superb battery life. Why  Because that's what we need. We have really severe energy problems in Africa. By the way  you can update Facebook and send Gmail from a phone like this. So we have found a way to use the available technology to send money via M Pesa  which is a bit like a check system for the mobile age. I come from Johannesburg  which is a mining town. It's built on gold. This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier. And the difference today is that  the gold of today is mobile. If you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked  first came the infrastructure  then came the industry around it  the brothels    it's a bit like the Internet today  right    and everything else that worked with it  bars  saloons  etc. The gold of today is mobile  and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible. So what are some of the things that you can do with it  Well  this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana  and what you do is you take medication  something that some people might spend their entire month's salary on  and you scratch off the code  and you send that to an SMS number  and it tells you if that is legitimate or if it's expired. Really simple  really effective  really life saving. In Kenya  there's a service called iCow  which just sends you really important information about how to look after your dairy. The dairy business in Kenya is a      million business  and the difference between a subsistence farmer and an abundance farmer is only a couple of liters of milk a day. And if you can do that  you can rise out of poverty. Really simple  using a basic phone. If you don't have electricity  no problem  We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill  as William Kamkwamba did. There's another great African that you've heard that's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world. He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power and the electricity industry in North America  and if he's lucky  he'll get us to Mars  hopefully in my lifetime. He comes from Pretoria  the capital of  South Africa   about    kilometers from where I live. So back to Joburg  which is sometimes called Egoli  which means City of Gold. And not only is mobile the gold of today  I don't believe that the gold is under the ground. I believe we are the gold. Like you've heard the other economists say  we are at the point where China was when its boom years began  and that's where we're going. So  you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge. Well  of course it's happening at the edge  because in the middle  everybody's updating Facebook  or worse still  they're trying to understand Facebook's privacy settings. This is not that catchy catchphrase. This is innovation over the edge. So  people like to call Africa a mobile first continent  but actually it's mobile only  so while everybody else is doing all of those things  we're solving the world's problems. So there's only one thing left to say.   You're welcome    Laughter  Anyone in the room thought about sex today  Yeah  you did. Thank you for putting your hand up over there. Well  I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams. I'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex. Now  when humans think about sex  male and female forms are generally what come to mind  but for many millions of years  such specific categories didn't even exist. Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings. It wasn't until about     million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives DNA out  and a vagina  something that receives it. Now invariably  you're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species  these very familiar structures  but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind blowing. Penile diversity is especially profuse. So this is a paper nautilus. It's a close relative of squid and octopus  and males have a hectocotylus. Just what is a hectocotylus  A detachable  swimming penis. It leaves the  body of the male   finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water  attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm. For many decades  biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether. Now  the tapir is a mammal from South America. And the tapir has a prehensile penis. It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands. And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus  not to mention it's a pretty good size. The biggest penis in the animal kingdom  however  is not that of the tapir. The biggest penis to body size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle  and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle. Mm hm.  Laughter  So with all of this diversity in structure  one might think  then  that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction. Simply insert part A into slot B  and we should all be good to go. But of course  that doesn't exactly happen  and that's because we can't just take form into account. We have to think about function as well  and when it comes to sex  function relates to the contributions made by the gametes  or the sperm and the eggs. And these contributions are far from equal. Eggs are very expensive to make  so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with. Sperm  on the other hand  is abundant and cheap  so it makes more sense for males to have a more sex is better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations. So how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes  I mean  if a female doesn't choose a particular male  or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough  then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things  avoiding predators  taking care of offspring  gathering and ingesting food. This is  of course  bad news for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank  and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization. This is bedbug sex  and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination. Males have a spiked  barbed penis that they literally stab into the female  and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina. They stab it anywhere in her body  and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries. If a female gets too many stab wounds  or if a stab wound happens to become infected  she can actually die from it. Now if you've ever been out for a nice  peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex  you've undoubtedly been alarmed  because it looks like gang rape. And quite frankly  that's exactly what it is. A group of males will grab a female  hold her down  and ballistically ejaculate their spiral shaped penis into her corkscrew shaped vagina over and over and over again. From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second. Now the female actually gets the last laugh  though  because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries. Now  I like to share stories like this with my audiences because  yeah  we humans  we tend to think sex  sex is fun  sex is good  there's romance  and there's orgasm. But orgasm didn't actually evolve until about    million years ago with the advent of mammals. But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that. There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one's partner. Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones. It's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different. Those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all. So going back to our biological minds  then  we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages  because she can use her time for other things  avoiding predators  taking care of young  finding and ingesting food. But biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages. Why do they do this  Well  according to the biological literature   During copulation  the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract.  Mm hm. These are Mexican guppies  and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments  and these filaments basically form a fish mustache  if you will. Now males have been observed to prod the female's genital opening prior to copulating with her  and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum  P.I. hypothesis  females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches. A little guppy porn for you right there. So we've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner. We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex. We've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner. Now unfortunately  in the animal kingdom  it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again. It's very common in many phyla  from invertebrates to avian species  mammals  and  of course  even in primates. Now interestingly  there  are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place. Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris  or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally  much like a penis  and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology. So before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina  she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside out it in her own body. I mean  imagine putting a penis into another penis. It's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action. Now  even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal  they're run by females  groups of females  sisters  aunts and offspring  and when young males attain sexual maturity  they're turfed out of the group. In hyena societies  adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale. They can take part in a kill only after everybody else  including the offspring. So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male  you take away all the social power he has. So what are my take home messages from my talk today  Well  sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere. The sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other  which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve. So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals  including ourselves  spend a good amount of time thinking about sex  but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it. So thank you  and happy daydreaming.   Rebecca Newberger Goldstein     Steven Pinker     The Long Reach of Reason   Cabbie  Twenty two dollars. Steven Pinker  Okay. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein  Reason  appears to have fallen on hard times  Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth and political discourse has become a race to the bottom. We're living in an era of scientific creationism       conspiracy theories  psychic hotlines  and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism. People who think too well are often accused of elitism  and even in the academy  there are attacks on logocentrism  the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking. SP  But is this necessarily a bad thing  Perhaps reason is overrated. Many pundits have argued that a good heart and steadfast moral clarity are superior to triangulations of overeducated policy wonks  like the best and brightest and that dragged us into the quagmire of Vietnam. And wasn't it reason that gave us the means to despoil the planet and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction  In this way of thinking   it's character and conscience  not cold hearted calculation  that will save us. Besides  a human being is not a brain on a stick. My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact. RNG  How could a reasoned argument logically entail the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments  Look  you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence. You're not threatening us or bribing us  suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest. By the very act of trying to reason us into your position  you're conceding reason's potency. Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be. You show up for that debate and you've already lost it. SP  But can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral  After all  you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end  and the end depends on the reasoner's passions. Reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony  but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife. Can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste  RNG  All on its own  the answer is no  but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes. You need two conditions  The first is that reasoners all care about their own well being. That's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go to work  and it's obviously present in all of us. We all care passionately about our own well being. The second condition is that reasoners are members of a community of reasoners who can affect one another's well being  can exchange messages  and comprehend each other's reasoning. And that's certainly true of our gregarious and loquatious species  well endowed with the instinct for language. SP  Well  that sounds good in theory  but has it worked that way in practice  In particular  can it explain a momentous historical development that I spoke about five years ago here at TED  Namely  we seem to be getting more humane. Centuries ago  our ancestors would burn cats alive as a form of popular entertainment. Knights waged constant war on each other by trying to kill as many of each other's peasants as possible. Governments executed people for frivolous reasons  like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden. The executions were designed to be as prolonged and as painful as possible  like crucifixion  disembowelment  breaking on the wheel. Respectable people kept slaves. For all our flaws  we have abandoned these barbaric practices. RNG  So  do you think it's human nature that's changed  SP  Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts that can erupt in violence  like greed  tribalism  revenge  dominance  sadism. But we also have instincts that can steer us away  like self control  empathy  a sense of fairness  what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. RNG  So if human nature didn't change  what invigorated those better angels  SP  Well  among other things  our circle of empathy expanded. Years ago  our ancestors would feel the pain only of their family and people in their village. But with the expansion of literacy and travel  people started to sympathize with wider and wider circles  the clan  the tribe  the nation  the race  and perhaps eventually  all of humanity. RNG  Can hard headed scientists really give so much credit to soft hearted empathy  SP  They can and do. Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain that respond to other people's actions the same way they respond to our own. Empathy emerges early in life  perhaps before the age of one. Books on empathy have become bestsellers  like  The Empathic Civilization  and  The Age of Empathy.  RNG  I'm all for empathy. I mean  who isn't  But all on its own  it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress. For one thing  it's innately biased toward blood relations  babies and warm  fuzzy animals. As far as empathy is concerned  ugly outsiders can go to hell. And even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are unconnected with us fall miserably short  a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by Adam Smith. Adam Smith  Let us suppose that the great empire of China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake  and let us consider how a  man of humanity in Europe would react on receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would  I imagine  first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people. He would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life  and when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed  he would pursue his business or his pleasure with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened. If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow  he would not sleep tonight  but provided he never saw them  he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren. SP  But if empathy wasn't enough to make us more humane  what else was there  RNG  Well  you didn't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels  reason. Reason has muscle. It's reason that provides the push to widen that circle of empathy. Every one of the humanitarian developments that you mentioned originated with thinkers who gave reasons for why some practice was indefensible. They demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves. SP  Are you saying that reason can actually change people's minds  Don't people just stick with whatever conviction serves their interests or conforms to the culture that they grew up in  RNG  Here's a fascinating fact about us  Contradictions bother us  at least when we're forced to confront them  which is just another way of saying that we are susceptible to reason. And if you look at the history of moral progress  you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments to changes in the way that we actually feel. Time and again  a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible  irrational  inconsistent with values already held. Their essay would go viral  get translated into many languages  get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons  and at dinner parties  and influence leaders  legislators  popular opinion. Eventually their conclusions get absorbed into the common sense of decency  erasing the tracks of the original argument that had gotten us there. Few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children. By now  these things just feel wrong. But just those arguments had to be made  and they were  in centuries past. SP  Are you saying that people needed a step by step argument to grasp why something might be a wee bit wrong with burning heretics at the stake  RNG  Oh  they did. Here's the French theologian Sebastian Castellio making the case. Sebastian Castellio  Calvin says that he's certain  and other sects say that they are. Who shall be judge  If the matter is certain  to whom is it so  To Calvin  But then  why does he write so many books about manifest truth  In view of the uncertainty  we must define heretics simply as one with whom we disagree. And if then we are going to kill heretics  the logical outcome will be a war of extermination  since each is sure of himself. SP  Or with hideous punishments like breaking on the wheel  RNG  The prohibition in our constitution of cruel and unusual punishments was a response to a pamphlet circulated in      by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria. Cesare Beccaria  As punishments become more cruel  the minds of men  which like fluids always adjust to the level of the objects that surround them  become hardened  and after a hundred years of cruel punishments  breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did. For a punishment to achieve its objective  it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime  and into this calculation ought to be factored the certainty of punishment and the loss of the good that the commission of the crime will produce. Everything beyond this is superfluous  and therefore tyrannical. SP  But surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war. RNG  No doubt  but modern anti war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war  such as the father of modernity  Erasmus. Erasmus  The advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide  and reach great numbers  while in war  if anything turns out happily  the advantage redounds only to a few  and those unworthy of reaping it. One man's safety is owing to the destruction of another. One man's prize is derived from the plunder of another. The cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning. Whatever is unfortunate in war  is severely so indeed  and whatever  on the contrary  is called good fortune  is a savage and a cruel good fortune  an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe. SP  But everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion. It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers  and it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel  Uncle Tom's Cabin  became a bestseller. RNG  But the ball got rolling a century before. John Locke bucked the tide of millennia that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural. He argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government. John Locke  Freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to everyone of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it  a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not  not to be subject to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of another man  as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. SP  Those words sound familiar. Where have I read them before  Ah  yes. Mary Astell  If absolute sovereignty  be not necessary in a state  how comes it to be so in a family  Or if in a family  why not in a state  Since no reason can be alleged for the one that will not hold more strongly for the other  if all men are born free  how is it that all women are born slaves  as they must be if being subjected to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of men be the perfect condition of slavery  RNG  That sort of co option is all in the job description of reason. One movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same  and once that's hammered home  it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to ignore the inconsistency. In the     s  the Civil Rights Movement inspired the movements for women's rights  children's rights  gay rights and even animal rights. But fully two centuries before  the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham had exposed the indefensibility of customary practices such as the cruelty to animals. Jeremy Bentham  The question is not  can they reason  nor can they talk  but can they suffer  RNG  And the persecution of homosexuals. JB  As to any primary mischief  it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone. On the contrary  it produces pleasure. The partners are both willing. If either of them be unwilling  the act is an offense  totally different in its nature of effects. It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape. As to the any danger exclusive of pain  the danger  if any  much consist in the tendency of the example. But what is the tendency of this example  To dispose others to engage in the same practices. But this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone. SP  Still  in every case  it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole. It kind of makes you wonder about our own time. Are there practices that we engage in where the arguments against them are there for all to see but nonetheless we persist in them  RNG  When our great grandchildren look back at us  will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave owning  heretic burning  wife beating  gay bashing ancestors  SP  I'm sure everyone here could think of an example. RNG  I opt for the mistreatment of animals in factory farms. SP  The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons. RNG  Scrimping on donations to life saving charities in the developing world. SP  The possession of nuclear weapons. RNG  The appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable  such as the ban on contraception. SP  What about religious faith in general  RNG  Eh  I'm not holding my breath. SP  Still  I have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future. RNG  And if  our friends  you detect a flaw in this argument  just remember you'll be depending on reason to point it out. Thank you. SP  Thank you. I'd like to talk today about how we can change our brains and our society. Meet Joe. Joe's    years old and a murderer. I met Joe    years ago on the lifer wing at Wormwood Scrubs high security prison in London. I'd like you to imagine this place. It looks and feels like it sounds  Wormwood Scrubs. Built at the end of the Victorian Era by the inmates themselves  it is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept. These individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil. And I was there to study their brains. I was part of a team of researchers from University College London  on a grant from the U.K. department of health. My task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths. That meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population. What lay at the root of their behavior  Was there a neurological cause for their condition  And if there was a neurological cause  could we find a cure  So I'd like to speak about change  and  especially about emotional change. Growing up  I was always intrigued by how people change. My mother  a clinical psychotherapist  would occasionally see patients at home in the evening. She would shut the door to the living room  and I imagined magical things happened in that room. At the age of five or six I would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door. On more than one occasion  I fell asleep and they had to push me out of the way at the end of the session. And I suppose that's how I found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs. Joe sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression. The prison warden  looking equally indifferent  said   Any trouble  just press the red buzzer  and we'll be around as soon as we can.  I sat down. The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me. I looked up at the red buzzer far behind Joe on the opposite wall. I looked at Joe. Perhaps detecting my concern  he leaned forward  and said  as reassuringly as he could   Ah  don't worry about the buzzer  it doesn't work anyway.  Over the subsequent months  we tested Joe and his fellow inmates  looking specifically at their ability to categorize different images of emotion. And we looked at their physical response to those emotions. So  for example  when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad  we instantly have a slight  measurable physical response  increased heart rate  sweating of the skin. Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately  they failed to show the emotions required. They failed to show a physical response. It was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy. So we wanted to look closer at this to use MRI to image their brains. That turned out to be not such an easy task. Imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central London in shackles and handcuffs in rush hour  and in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner  you have to remove all metal objects  including shackles and handcuffs  and  as I learned  all body piercings. After some time  however  we had a tentative answer. These individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood. There was something else. People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala. The amygdala is an almond shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain. It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy. Normally  the more empathic a person is  the larger and more active their amygdala is. Our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala  which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior. So let's take a step back. Normally  acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up  like learning to speak. At the age of six months  virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects. At the age of    months  most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others. So for example  your mother raises her hands to stretch  and you imitate her behavior. At first  this isn't perfect. I remember my cousin Sasha  two years old at the time  looking through a picture book and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand  licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand. Bit by bit  we build the foundations  of the social brain so that by the time we're three  four years old  most children  not all  have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others  another prerequisite for empathy. The fact that this developmental progression is universal  irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit  strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn. If you doubt this  try  as I've done  to renege on a promise you've made to a four year old. You will find that the mind of a four year old is not na ve in the slightest. It is more akin to a Swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness. The early years are crucial. There seems to be a window of opportunity  after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult  like adults learning a foreign language. That's not to say it's impossible. A recent  wonderful study from Stanford University showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards. Now I'm not suggesting we endow criminals with superpowers  but I am suggesting that we need to find ways to get Joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior  for their benefit and for the benefit of the rest of us. So can brains change  For over     years  neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood  no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain. The brain could only change within certain set limits. That was the dogma. But then  in the     s  studies starting showing  following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others  studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian brain  first in the olfactory bulb  which is responsible for our sense of smell  then in the hippocampus involving short term memory  and finally in the amygdala itself. In order to understand how this process works  I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford specializing in learning and development. Instead of psychopaths  I studied mice  because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals. So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage  a shoebox  essentially  with cotton wool  alone and without much stimulation  not only does it not thrive  but it will often develop strange  repetitive behaviors. This naturally sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice  even becoming aggressive when introduced to them. However  mice reared in what we called an enriched environment  a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore  demonstrate neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells  and as we showed  they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks. Now  they don't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street  but their improved environment results in healthy  sociable behavior. Mice reared in a standard cage  by contrast  not dissimilar  you might say  from a prison cell  have dramatically lower levels of new neurons in the brain. It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals  including primates like us  can show neurogenesis. In some areas of the brain  more than    percent of cells are newly formed. We're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have  but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood. However  our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment. Stress hormones  glucocorticoids  released by the brain  suppress the growth of these new cells. The more stress  the less brain development  which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels. This is the interplay between nature and nurture in real time in front of our eyes. When you think about it  it is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth. Of course  imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society. Our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their MRI scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala. The evidence is actually the other way. Because our brains are capable of change  we need to take responsibility for our actions  and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation. One way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs. Here victims  if they choose to participate  and perpetrators meet face to face in safe  structured encounters  and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions  and the victim plays an active role in the process. In such a setting  the perpetrator can see  perhaps for the first time  the victim as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response. This stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration. Such programs won't work for everyone  but for many  it could be a way to break the frozen sea within. So what can we do now  How can we apply this knowledge  I'd like to leave you with three lessons that I learned. The first thing that I learned was that we need to change our mindset. Since Wormwood Scrubs was built     years ago  society has advanced in virtually every aspect  in the way we run our schools  our hospitals. Yet the moment we speak about prisons  it's as though we're back in Dickensian times  if not medieval times. For too long  I believe  we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human  nature cannot change  and as a society  it's costing us dearly. We know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change  and the best way to achieve that  even in adults  is to change and modulate our environment. The second thing I have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral to bringing about social change. It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place a high security inmate in an MRI scanner. Well actually  that turns out not to be so easy  but ultimately what we want to show is whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates. In order to answer complex questions like that  we need people of different backgrounds    lab based scientists and clinicians  social workers and policy makers  philanthropists and human rights activists   to work together. Finally  I believe we need to change our own amygdalae  because this issue goes to the heart not just of who Joe is  but who we are. We need to change our view of Joe as someone wholly irredeemable  because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable  how is he going to see himself as any different  In another decade  Joe will be released from Wormwood Scrubs. Will he be among the    percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system  Wouldn't it be better if  while serving his sentence  Joe was able to train his amygdala  which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections  so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released  Surely  that would be in the interest of all of us. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  The rights of citizens  the future of the Internet. So I would like to welcome to the TED stage the man behind those revelations  Ed Snowden. Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia controlling this bot from his laptop  so he can see what the bot can see. Ed  welcome to the TED stage. What can you see  as a matter of fact  Edward Snowden  Ha  I can see everyone. This is amazing. CA  Ed  some questions for you. You've been called many things in the last few months. You've been called a whistleblower  a traitor  a hero. What words would you describe yourself with  ES  You know  everybody who is involved with this debate has been struggling over me and my personality and how to describe me. But when I think about it  this isn't the question that we should be struggling with. Who I am really doesn't matter at all. If I'm the worst person in the world  you can hate me and move on. What really matters here are the issues. What really matters here is the kind of government we want  the kind of Internet we want  the kind of relationship between people and societies. And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards  and we've seen that increasing over time. If I had to describe myself  I wouldn't use words like  hero.  I wouldn't use  patriot   and I wouldn't use  traitor.  I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen  just like everyone else. CA  So just to give some context for those who don't know the whole story    this time a year ago  you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA. As a sysadmin  you had access to their systems  and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June's revelations. Now  what propelled you to do this  ES  You know  when I was sitting in Hawaii  and the years before  when I was working in the intelligence community  I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me. We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community  things that need to be done  and things that help everyone. But there are also things that go too far. There are things that shouldn't be done  and decisions that were being made in secret without the public's awareness  without the public's consent  and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs. When I really came to struggle with these issues  I thought to myself  how can I do this in the most responsible way  that maximizes the public benefit while minimizing the risks  And out of all the solutions that I could come up with  out of going to Congress  when there were no laws  there were no legal protections for a private employee  a contractor in intelligence like myself  there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out. But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason  and that's to enable an adversarial press  to challenge the government  but also to work together with the government  to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance without putting our national security at risk. And by working with journalists  by giving all of my information back to the American people  rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication  we've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone. And the risks that have been threatened  the risks that have been played up by the government have never materialized. We've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm  and because of that  I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made. CA  So let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed. If we could have a slide up  and Ed  I don't know whether you can see  the slides are here. This is a slide of the PRISM program  and maybe you could tell the audience what that was that was revealed. ES  The best way to understand PRISM  because there's been a little bit of controversy  is to first talk about what PRISM isn't. Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata. They've said it's just metadata  it's just metadata  and they're talking about a specific legal authority called Section     of the Patriot Act. That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping  mass surveillance of the entire country's phone records  things like that    who you're talking to  when you're talking to them  where you traveled. These are all metadata events. PRISM is about content. It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America  it could deputize corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA. And even though some of these companies did resist  even though some of them    I believe Yahoo was one of them   challenged them in court  they all lost  because it was never tried by an open court. They were only tried by a secret court. And something that we've seen  something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is  there's been a talking point in the U.S. government where they've said    federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful  but what they don't tell you is those are secret judges in a secret court based on secret interpretations of law that's considered        warrant requests over    years  and in    years only rejected    government requests. These aren't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be. CA  Now  this slide that we're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies  Internet companies  are alleged to have joined the program  and where data collection began from them. Now  they have denied collaborating with the NSA. How was that data collected by the NSA  ES  Right. So the NSA's own slides refer to it as direct access. What that means to an actual NSA analyst  someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting  Chinese cyber hackers  things like that  in Hawaii  is the provenance of that data is directly from their servers. It doesn't mean that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA palling around and making back room deals about how they're going to give this stuff away. Now each company handles it different ways. Some are responsible. Some are somewhat less responsible. But the bottom line is  when we talk about how this information is given  it's coming from the companies themselves. It's not stolen from the lines. But there's an important thing to remember here  even though companies pushed back  even though companies demanded  hey  let's do this through a warrant process  let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review  some sort of basis for handing over these users' data  we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself. So even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA  the NSA isn't satisfied with that  and because of that  we need our companies to work very hard to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user  and also advocate for the rights of the users. And I think over the last year  we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that  and I encourage them to continue. CA  What more should they do  ES  The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today  right now  without consulting with lawyers  to protect the rights of users worldwide  is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit. The reason this matters is today  if you go to look at a copy of        on Amazon.com  the NSA can see a record of that  the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that  the Chinese service can see a record of that  the French service  the German service  the services of Andorra. They can all see it because it's unencrypted. The world's library is Amazon.com  but not only do they not support encryption by default  you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books. This is something that we need to change  not just for Amazon  I don't mean to single them out  but they're a great example. All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default for all users who haven't taken any action or picked any special methods on their own. That'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide. CA  Ed  come with me to this part of the stage. I want to show you the next slide here.  Applause  This is a program called Boundless Informant. What is that  ES  So  I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this. This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms. Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress. The NSA was previously asked by Congress  was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted. They said no. They said  we don't track those stats  and we can't track those stats. We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world  because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy. Now  I really appreciate that sentiment from them  but the reality  when you look at this slide is  not only do they have the capability  the capability already exists. It's already in place. The NSA has its own internal data format that tracks both ends of a communication  and if it says  this communication came from America  they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today  right now. And what Boundless Informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted in America about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians. I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency should be aiming for. CA  Ed  there was a story broken in the Washington Post  again from your data. The headline says   NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year.  Tell us about that. ES  We also heard in Congressional testimony last year  it was an amazing thing for someone like me who came from the NSA and who's seen the actual internal documents  knows what's in them  to see officials testifying under oath that there had been no abuses  that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules  when we knew this story was coming. But what's especially interesting about this  about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules  their own laws thousands of times in a single year  including one event by itself  one event out of those        that affected more than       people. In another event  they intercepted all the calls in Washington  D.C.  by accident. What's amazing about this  this report  that didn't get that much attention  is the fact that not only were there       abuses  the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee  Dianne Feinstein  had not seen this report until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report. And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it  but had never seen this before that. What does that say about the state of oversight in American intelligence when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year  CA  Ed  one response to this whole debate is this  Why should we care about all this surveillance  honestly  I mean  look  if you've done nothing wrong  you've got nothing to worry about. What's wrong with that point of view  ES  Well  so the first thing is  you're giving up your rights. You're saying hey  you know  I don't think I'm going to need them  so I'm just going to trust that  you know  let's get rid of them  it doesn't really matter  these guys are going to do the right thing. Your rights matter because you never know when you're going to need them. Beyond that  it's a part of our cultural identity  not just in America  but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world. People should be able to pick up the phone and to call their family  people should be able to send a text message to their loved ones  people should be able to buy a book online  they should be able to travel by train  they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look to an agent of the government  possibly not even your government years in the future  how they're going to be misinterpreted and what they're going to think your intentions were. We have a right to privacy. We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion because we recognize that trusting anybody  any government authority  with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored. CA  Some people are furious at what you've done. I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite  Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog. He thinks you've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in American history. What would you say to people who think that  ES  Dick Cheney's really something else. Thank you.  Laughter  I think it's amazing  because at the time Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work  Dick Cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide  the skies were going to ignite and the seas were going to boil off  and now he's saying it's a flea bite. So we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security from these kind of officials. But let's assume that these people really believe this. I would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security. The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe. The public interest is not always the same as the national interest. Going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe  and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet. The Internet is not the enemy. Our economy is not the enemy. American businesses  Chinese businesses  and any other company out there is a part of our society. It's a part of our interconnected world. There are ties of fraternity that bond us together  and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards  the security  the manner of behavior  that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by. CA  But it's alleged that you've stolen  .  million documents. It seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far. Are there more revelations to come  ES  There are absolutely more revelations to come. I don't think there's any question that some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come. CA  Come here  because I want to ask you about this particular revelation. Come and take a look at this. I mean  this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they have heard in the last few months. It's about a program called  Bullrun.  Can you explain what that is  ES  So Bullrun  and this is again where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor  this is a program named after a Civil War battle. The British counterpart is called Edgehill  which is a U.K. civil war battle. And the reason that I believe they're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure. They're programs through which the NSA intentionally misleads corporate partners. They tell corporate partners that these are safe standards. They say hey  we need to work with you to secure your systems  but in reality  they're giving bad advice to these companies that makes them degrade the security of their services. They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit  but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it can then use to let themselves in to the world's communications. And this is really dangerous  because if we lose a single standard  if we lose the trust of something like SSL  which was specifically targeted by the Bullrun program  we will live a less safe world overall. We won't be able to access our banks and we won't be able to access commerce without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends. CA  And do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyberattacks from other sources  ES  Absolutely. One of the problems  one of the dangerous legacies that we've seen in the post      era  is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats. They've been in charge of offensive operations  that is hacking  but they've also been in charge of defensive operations  and traditionally they've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more. If we hack a Chinese business and steal their secrets  if we hack a government office in Berlin and steal their secrets  that has less value to the American people than making sure that the Chinese can't get access to our secrets. So by reducing the security of our communications  they're not only putting the world at risk  they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way  because intellectual property is the basis  the foundation of our economy  and if we put that at risk through weak security  we're going to be paying for it for years. CA  But they've made a calculation that it was worth doing this as part of America's defense against terrorism. Surely that makes it a price worth paying. ES  Well  when you look at the results of these programs in stopping terrorism  you will see that that's unfounded  and you don't have to take my word for it  because we've had the first open court  the first federal court that's reviewed this  outside the secrecy arrangement  called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional. Congress  who has access to be briefed on these things  and now has the desire to be  has produced bills to reform it  and two independent White House panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the United States. So is it really terrorism that we're stopping  Do these programs have any value at all  I say no  and all three branches of the American government say no as well. CA  I mean  do you think there's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism  ES  I'm sorry  I couldn't hear you  say again  CA  Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation for them other than the war against terrorism  ES  Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world would call a cover for action. Terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn't give otherwise. The Bullrun and Edgehill type programs  the NSA asked for these authorities back in the     s. They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case. The FBI went to Congress and did make the case. But Congress and the American people said no. They said  it's not worth the risk to our economy. They said it's worth too much damage to our society to justify the gains. But what we saw is  in the post      era  they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism to start these programs in secret without asking Congress  without asking the American people  and it's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need to guard ourselves against  because it makes us less safe  and it offers no value. CA  Okay  come with me here for a sec  because I've got a more personal question for you. Speaking of terror  most people would find the situation you're in right now in Russia pretty terrifying. You obviously heard what happened  what the treatment that Bradley Manning got  Chelsea Manning as now is  and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead. How are you coping with this  How are you coping with the fear  ES  It's no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead. I've made clear again and again and again that I go to sleep every morning thinking about what I can do for the American people. I don't want to harm my government. I want to help my government  but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process  they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial  these are things that we need to work against as a society  and say hey  this is not appropriate. We shouldn't be threatening dissidents. We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism. And whatever part I can do to see that end  I'm happy to do despite the risks. CA  So I'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here  because I know there's widely differing reactions to Edward Snowden. Suppose you had the following two choices  right  You could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered America or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards America and the world's long term good  Those are the two choices I'll give you. I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with the first of those  that this was a reckless act  There are some hands going up. Some hands going up. It's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here  but I see them. ES  I can see you.  Laughter  CA  And who goes with the second choice  the fundamentally heroic act  And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn't show a hand and I think are still thinking this through  because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn't split along traditional political lines. It's not left or right  it's not really about pro government  libertarian  or not just that. Part of it is almost a generational issue. You're part of a generation that grew up with the Internet  and it seems as if you become offended at almost a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the Internet. Is there some truth to that  ES  It is. I think it's very true. This is not a left or right issue. Our basic freedoms  and when I say our  I don't just mean Americans  I mean people around the world  it's not a partisan issue. These are things that all people believe  and it's up to all of us to protect them  and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open Internet  it's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy  and if we don't change things  if we don't stand up to make the changes we need to do to keep the Internet safe  not just for us but for everyone  we're going to lose that  and that would be a tremendous loss  not just for us  but for the world. CA  Well  I have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web  who I actually think is with us  Sir Tim Berners Lee. Tim  actually  would you like to come up and say  do we have a microphone for Tim  Tim  good to see you. Come up there. Which camp are you in  by the way  traitor  hero  I have a theory on this  but    Tim Berners Lee  I've given much longer answers to that question  but hero  if I have to make the choice between the two. CA  And Ed  I think you've read the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet. Is that something that makes sense  ES  Absolutely. I mean  my generation  I grew up not just thinking about the Internet  but I grew up in the Internet  and although I never expected to have the chance to defend it in such a direct and practical manner and to embody it in this unusual  almost avatar manner  I think there's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the Internet has actually become close to the Internet as a result of their political expression. And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need. We need to encode our values not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet  and it's something that I hope  I invite everyone in the audience  not just here in Vancouver but around the world  to join and participate in. CA  Do you have a question for Ed  TBL  Well  two questions  a general question   CA  Ed  can you still hear us  ES  Yes  I can hear you. CA  Oh  he's back. TBL  The wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment. ES  It's a little bit of an NSA problem. TBL  So  from the    years  stepping back and thinking  what would you think would be the best that we could achieve from all the discussions that we have about the web we want  ES  When we think about in terms of how far we can go  I think that's a question that's really only limited by what we're willing to put into it. I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past has been exactly what we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need  and by cooperating  by engaging not just the technical parts of society  but as you said  the users  the people around the world who contribute through the Internet  through social media  who just check the weather  who rely on it every day as a part of their life  to champion that. We'll get not just the Internet we've had  but a better Internet  a better now  something that we can use to build a future that'll be better not just than what we hoped for but anything that we could have imagined. CA  It's    years ago that TED was founded      . A lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that actually George Orwell got it wrong. It's not Big Brother watching us. We  through the power of the web  and transparency  are now watching Big Brother. Your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view  but you still believe there's a way of doing something about that. And you do too. ES  Right  so there is an argument to be made that the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously. There was a recent legal article at Yale that established something called the Bankston Soltani Principle  which is that our expectation of privacy is violated when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude  and each time that occurs  we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights. Now  that hasn't happened since the government's surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude  and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today  but there is still hope  because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology. I am living proof that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win  and I think that's something that we need to take hope from  and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world. Journalism is not a crime  communication is not a crime  and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities. CA  I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot  but I imagine it's  this is the hand right here. TBL  That'll come very soon. ES  Nice to meet you  and I hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does. CA  Thank you  Tim. I mean  The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you. Would you welcome the chance to come back to America  ES  Absolutely. There's really no question  the principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world  and I think if the press is now saying  we support this  this is something that needed to happen  that's a powerful argument  but it's not the final argument  and I think that's something that public should decide. But at the same time  the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal  that they want me to compromise the journalists with which I've been working  to come back  and I want to make it very clear that I did not do this to be safe. I did this to do what was right  and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself. CA  In the meantime  courtesy of the Internet and this technology  you're here  back in North America  not quite the U.S.  Canada  in this form. I'm curious  how does that feel  ES  Canada is different than what I expected. It's a lot warmer. CA  At TED  the mission is  ideas worth spreading.  If you could encapsulate it in a single idea  what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment  ES  I would say the last year has been a reminder that democracy may die behind closed doors  but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors  and we don't have to give up our privacy to have good government. We don't have to give up our liberty to have security. And I think by working together we can have both open government and private lives  and I look forward to working with everyone around the world to see that happen. Thank you very much. CA  Ed  thank you. What's the scariest thing you've ever done  Or another way to say it is  what's the most dangerous  thing that you've ever done  And why did you do it  I know what the most dangerous thing is that I've ever done because NASA does the math. You look back to the first five shuttle launches  the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine. And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in          shuttle flight  the odds were still now that we look back about one in    or so    one in     one in   . Not great odds  so it's a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you're going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you're either going to be floating  effortlessly  gloriously in space  or you'll be dead. You go into  at the Kennedy Space Center  the suit up room  the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in  that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon. And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad    in the Astro van    heading out to the launchpad  and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center  it's normally predawn  and in the distance  lit up by the huge xenon lights  is your spaceship    the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet. The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed  almost holding hands  looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger. We ride the elevator up and we crawl in  on your hands and knees into the spaceship  one at a time  and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back. And the hatch is closed  and suddenly  what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real  something that I dreamed about  in fact  that I chose to do when I was nine years old  is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening. In the astronaut business    the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle  it's the most complicated flying machine ever built. And in the astronaut business   we have a saying  which is  there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse. And so you're very conscious in the cockpit  you're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do  all the switches and all the  wickets you have to go through. And as the time gets closer and closer  this excitement is building. And then about three and a  half minutes before launch  the huge nozzles on the back  like the size of big church bells  swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle  like the vehicle is alive underneath you  like an elephant getting up  off its knees or something. And then about    seconds before launch  the vehicle is completely alive    it is ready to go    the APUs are running  the computers are all self contained  it's ready to leave the planet. And    seconds before launch  this happens  nine  eight  seven  six       start  two  one  booster ignition  and liftoff of  the space shuttle Discovery  returning to the space station  paving the way ... Chris Hadfield  It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things. You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself. It's shaking you so hard you can't focus on the instruments in front of you. It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space  accelerating wildly straight up  shouldering your way through the air  and you're in a very complex place    paying attention  watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face. After two minutes  those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines  the hydrogen and oxygen  and it's as if you're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you've never accelerated. You get lighter and lighter  the force gets on us heavier and heavier. It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something. Until finally  after about eight minutes and    seconds or so  we are finally at exactly the right altitude  exactly the right speed  the right direction  the engine shut off  and we're weightless. And we're alive. It's an amazing experience. But why would we take that risk  Why would you do something that dangerous  In my case the answer is fairly straightforward. I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do. I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me  it was just an obvious thing    I want to somehow turn myself into that. But the real question is  how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it  How do you deal with fear versus danger  And having the goal in mind  thinking about where it might lead  directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible  to be able to launch and go  help build a space station where you are on board a million pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second  eight kilometers a second  around the world    times a day  with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running     experiments inside. But maybe even more importantly  allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means  to be able to look down and have    if your jaw could drop  it would    the jaw dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self propelled art gallery of fantastic  constantly changing beauty that is the world itself. And you see  because of the speed  a sunrise or a sunset every    minutes for half a year. And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk. You are in a one person spaceship that is your spacesuit  and you're going through space with the world. It's an entirely different perspective  you're not looking up at the universe  you and the Earth are going  through the universe together. And you're holding on with one hand  looking at the world turn beside you. It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you. And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything  it's unfathomable blackness  with a texture you feel like you  could stick your hand into. and you are holding on with one hand  one link to the other seven billion people. And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind  and I didn't know why. Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working. I was thinking  what do I do next  I thought  well maybe that's why we have two eyes  so I kept working. But unfortunately  without gravity  tears don't fall. So you just get a bigger and  bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually  the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it  across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes  goosh  into your other eye  and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship. So what's the scariest thing you've ever done  Maybe it's spiders. A lot of people are afraid of spiders. I think you should be afraid of spiders    spiders are creepy and they've got long  hairy legs  and spiders like this one  the brown recluse    it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you  you end with one of these  horrible  big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you  in fact. And how do you know  And so a spider lands on you  and you go through this great  spasmy attack because spiders are scary. But then you could say  well  is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not  I don't know. Are there brown recluses here  So if you actually do the research  you find out that in the world there are about         different types of spiders  and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of       . And if you're in Canada  because of the cold winters here in B.C.  there's about           different types of spiders and there's one    one    that is venomous  and its venom isn't even fatal  it's just kind of like a nasty sting. And that spider    not only that  but that spider has beautiful markings on it  it's like  I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation  symbol on my back  it's the black widow.  So  if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider    and it lives close the ground  you're walking along  you are  never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you. Spider webs like this  it doesn't build those  it builds them down in the corners. And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male  it doesn't care about you. So in fact  the next time you walk into a spiderweb  you don't need to panic and go  with your caveman reaction. The danger is entirely different than the fear. How do you get around it  though  How do you change your behavior  Well  next time you see a spiderweb  have a good look  make sure  it's not a black widow spider  and then walk into it. And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one. It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal. And the spider that may come out is  no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly. And then I guarantee you if you  walk through     spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior  your caveman reaction  and you will now be able to walk  in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb    or into your grandma's attic or whatever  into your own basement. And you can apply this to anything. If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded  your natural reaction would be to panic  I think. It would make you nervous and worried. But we had considered all the venom  and we had practiced with a whole  variety of different spiderwebs. We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times. And we don't just practice things going right  we practice things going wrong all the time  so that you are constantly walking  through those spiderwebs. And not just underwater  but  also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic. So when you finally actually  get outside on a spacewalk  it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time. And even if you're blinded  your natural  panicky reaction doesn't happen. Instead you kind of look around and go   Okay  I can't see  but I can hear  I can talk  Scott Parazynski is out here with me. He could come over and help me.  We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue  so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to. I could find my own way back. It's not nearly as big a deal. And actually  if you keep on crying for a while  whatever that gunk was that's  in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again  and Houston  if you negotiate with them  they will let you then keep working. We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside  Jeff got some cotton batting and took  the crusty stuff around my eyes  and it turned out it was just the anti fog  sort of a mixture of oil and soap  that got in my eye. And now we use Johnson's No More Tears  which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning.  Laughter  But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger  where is the real risk  What is the real thing that you should be afraid of  Not just a generic fear of bad things happening. You can fundamentally change  your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you ... where you could see the  hardpan south of the Sahara  or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike  or the unconscious gingham  of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles. You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge  just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear. You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened. It's time to come home at the end. This is our spaceship  the Soyuz  that little one. Three of us climb in  and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere. These two parts here actually melt  we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere. The only part that survives is the little bullet that we're riding in  and it falls into the atmosphere  and in essence you are riding a meteorite home  and riding meteorites is scary  and it ought to be. But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming  like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth     Laughter     instead     years previously we had started studying Russian  and then once you learn Russian  then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian  and then we learned vehicle control theory  and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again. And in fact  you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a    kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth. So in fact  when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz  we weren't screaming  we were laughing  it was fun. And when the great big parachute opened  we knew that if it didn't open there's a second parachute  and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism. So we came back  we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz  in Kazakhstan. search and recovery helicopters  once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi   helicopters. Touchdown         and    seconds  a.m. Central Time. CH  And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your  spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end  but you're ready for it you're in a custom built seat  you know how the shock absorber works. And then eventually the Russians reach in  drag you out  plunk you into a chair  and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience. You have taken the dreams of that nine year old boy  which were impossible and dauntingly scary  dauntingly terrifying  and put them into practice  and figured out a way to reprogram yourself  to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise. Just to finish  they asked me to play that guitar. I know this song  and it's really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself  but it's also  I think  a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe  we are people  and we're taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self perception into a new place.   This is Major Tom to ground control     I've left forevermore     And I'm floating in a most peculiar way     And the stars look very different today     For here am I floating in the tin can     A last glimpse of the world     Planet Earth is blue and  there's so much left to do   Fear not. That's very nice of you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I've come here today to talk to you about a problem. It's a very simple yet devastating problem  one that spans the globe and is affecting all of us. The problem is anonymous companies. It sounds like a really dry and technical thing  doesn't it  But anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes. So  why am I here talking to all of you  Well  I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and I to question authority  I don't think they knew where it might lead. And  they probably really regretted it during my stroppy teenage years when  predictably  I questioned their authority a lot. And a lot of my school teachers didn't appreciate it much either. You see  since the age of about five I've always asked the question  but why  But why does the Earth go around the sun  But why is blood red  But why do I have to go to school  But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority  And little did I realize that this question would become the basis of everything I would do. And so it was in my twenties  a long time ago  that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London I was sitting with Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley and we were busy stuffing envelopes for a mail out in the office of the campaign group where we worked at the time. And as usual  we were talking  about the world's problems. And in particular  we were talking about the civil war in Cambodia. And we had talked about that  many  many times before. But then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other and said  but why don't we try and change this  And from that slightly crazy question  over two decades and many campaigns later  including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war  from that crazy question  Global Witness is now an    strong team of campaigners  investigators   journalists and lawyers. And we're all driven by the same belief  that change really is possible. So  what exactly does Global Witness do  We investigate  we report  to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict    for stealing millions from citizens around the world  also known as state looting  and for destroying the environment. And then we campaign hard to  change the system itself. And we're doing this because  so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet. And much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices. And one of these is anonymous companies. Now we've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations  like in the Democratic Republic of Congo  where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars. That's twice the country's health  and education budget combined. Or in Liberia  where an international predatory logging company used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests. Or political corruption in Sarawak  Malaysia  which has led to the destruction  of much of its forests. Well  that uses anonymous companies too. We secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies. And the awful thing is  there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life. This truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight. Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel  the Zetas  who use anonymous companies  to launder profits while their drugs related violence is tearing communities apart across the Americas. Or the anonymous company  which bought up Americans' tax debts  piled on the legal fees and then gave homeowners a choice  Pay up or lose your home. Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars  and not being able to find out who you were really up against. Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too. As the Iranian government found out when  through a series of front companies  it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan  on Fifth Avenue  despite American sanctions. And Juicy Couture  home of of the velvet track suit  and other companies were the unwitting  unknowing tenants there. There are just so many examples  the horesemeat scandal in Europe  the Italian mafia  they've used these companies for decades. The      million American Medicare fraud  the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in Eastern Europe in the early '  s. Anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the Ukraine. But  for every case that we and others expose there are so many more that will remain hidden away because of the current system. And it's just a simple truth that some of the people responsible  for outrageous crimes  for stealing from you and me and millions of others  they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and they're doing this with ease  and they're doing it using legal structures. And really  that is unfair. Well  you might well ask  what exactly is an anonymous company  and can I really set one up  and use it  without anyone knowing who I am  Well  the answer is  yes you can. But if you're anything like me  you'll want to see some of that for yourself  so let me show you. Well first you need to work out where you want to set it up. Now  at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here's the thing  shockingly  my own hometown  London  and indeed the U.K.  is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company. And the other  even better  I'm afraid that's America. Do you know  in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card  like Delaware  which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company. Okay  so let's say it's America  and let's say it's Delaware  and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider. These are the companies that  can set your one up for you  and remember  it's all legal  routine business practice. So  here's one  but there are plenty of others to choose from. And having made your choice  you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a contact  name and address. But don't worry  it doesn't have to be your name. It can be your lawyer's or your service provider's  and it's not for the public record anyway. And then you add the owner of the company. Now this is the key part  and again it doesn't have to be you  because you can get creative  because there is a whole universe  out there of nominees to choose from. And nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company's owner. And if you don't want to involve anyone else  it doesn't even have to be an actual human being. It could be another company. And then finally  give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment. And then the service provider will take a few hours or more to process it. But there you are  in    minutes of online shopping you can create yourself an anonymous company. And not only is it easy  really  really easy and cheap  it's totally legal too. But the fun doesn't have to end there  maybe you want to be even more anonymous. Well  that's no problem either. You can simply keep adding layers  companies owned by companies. You can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries  like a giant web  each layer adds anonymity. Each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is. But whose interests is this all serving  It might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual  but what about all of us  the public  There hasn't even been a global conversation yet about whether it's okay to misuse companies in this way. And what does it all mean for us  Well  an example that really haunts me is one I came across recently. And it's that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in Buenos Aires about a decade ago. It was the night before New Year's Eve. Three thousand very happy revelers  many of them teenagers  were crammed into a space meant for      . And then tragedy struck  a fire broke out plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling and toxic smoke filled the club. So people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut. Over     people died. Seven hundred were injured trying to get out. And as the victims' families  and the city and the country reeled in shock  investigators tried to find out who was responsible. And as they looked for the owners of the club  they found instead anonymous companies  and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies. Now ultimately  a range of people were charged and some went to jail. But this was an awful tragedy  and it shouldn't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths. Because in an age when there is so much information out there in the open  why should this crucial information about company ownership stay hidden away  Why should tax evaders  corrupt  government officials  arms traders and more  be able to hide their identities from us  the public  Why should this secrecy be such  an accepted business practice  Anonymous companies might be the norm right now but it wasn't always this way. Companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line. Companies were created to limit financial risk  they were never intended to  be used as a moral shield. Companies were never intended to be anonymous  and they don't have to be. And so I come to my wish. My wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good. Together let's ignite world opinion  change the law  and launch a new era of openness in business. So what might this look like  Well  imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company. Imagine if this data were open and free  accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike. Imagine what a game changer that would be. So how are we going to do this  Well  there is only one way. Together  we have to change the law globally to create public registries which list the true owners of companies and can be accessed by all with no loopholes. And yes  this is ambitious  but there is momentum on this issue  and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum  and it's just starting on this issue. There is such an opportunity right now. And the TED community of creative and innovative thinkers and doers across all of society could make the crucial difference. You really can make this change happen. Now  a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word. It's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning. And the techies among you  you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be. Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue. The U.K. government is already on board  it supports these public registries. And just last week  the European Parliament came on board with a vote     to    in favor of public registries. That is momentum. But it's early days. America still needs to come on board  as do so many other countries. And to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians  because without that  real far reaching  world shifting change just isn't going to happen. Because this isn't just about changing the law  this is about starting a conversation about what it's okay for companies to do  and in what ways is it acceptable  to use company structures. This isn't just a dry policy issue. This is a human issue which affects us all. This is about being on the right side of history. Global citizens  innovators   business leaders  individuals  we need you. Together  let's kickstart this global movement. Let's just do it  let's end anonymous companies. Thank you. Chris Anderson  We had Edward Snowden here a couple days ago  and this is response time. And several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA. So Richard Ledgett is the   th deputy director of the National Security Agency  and he's a senior civilian officer there  acts as its chief operating officer  guiding strategies  setting internal policies  and serving as the principal advisor to the director. And all being well  welcome  Rick Ledgett  to TED. Richard Ledgett  I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here. I look forward to the conversation  so thanks for arranging for that. CA  Thank you  Rick. We appreciate you joining us. It's certainly quite a strong statement that the NSA is willing to reach out and show a more open face here. You saw  I think  the talk and interview that Edward Snowden gave here a couple days ago. What did you make of it  RL  So I think it was interesting. We didn't realize that he  was going to show up there  so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that. I think that  like a lot of the things that have come out since Mr. Snowden started disclosing classified information  there were some kernels of truth in there  but a lot of extrapolations and half truths in there  and I'm interested in helping to address those. I think this is a really important conversation that we're having in the United States and internationally  and I think it is important and of import  and so given that  we need to have that be a fact based conversation  and we want to help make that happen. CA  So the question that a lot  of people have here is  what do you make of Snowden's motivations for doing what he did  and did he have an alternative way that he could have gone  RL  He absolutely did have alternative ways that he could have gone  and I actually think that characterizing him as a whistleblower actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities. So what if somebody who works in the NSA    and there are over        people who do. They're all great citizens. They're just like your husbands  fathers  sisters  brothers  neighbors  nephews  friends and relatives  all of whom are interested in doing the right thing for their country and for our allies internationally  and so there are a variety of venues to address if folks have a concern. First off  there's their supervisor  and up through the supervisory chain within their organization. If folks aren't comfortable with that  there are a number of inspectors general. In the case of Mr. Snowden  he had the option of the NSA inspector general  the Navy inspector general  the Pacific Command inspector general  the Department of Defense inspector general  and the intelligence community inspector general  any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels and been happy to address them. He had the option to go to congressional committees  and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place  and so he didn't do any of those things. CA  Now  you had said that Ed Snowden had other avenues for raising his concerns. The comeback on that is a couple of things  one  that he certainly believes that as a contractor  the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available  two  there's a track record of other whistleblowers  like  Thomas Andrews Drake  being treated pretty harshly  by some views  and thirdly  what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered  but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government. I mean  in that circumstance  couldn't you argue that what he did was reasonable  RL  No  I don't agree with that. I think that the   sorry  I'm getting feedback through the microphone there   the actions that he took were inappropriate because of the fact that  he put people's lives at risk  basically  in the long run  and I know there's been a lot of talk in public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists that say that the things that have been disclosed have not put national security and people at risk  and that is categorically not true. They actually do. I think there's also an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better than the framers of the Constitution in how the government should  be designed and work for separation of powers and the fact that the executive  and the legislative branch have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other  and then the judicial branch  which oversees the entire process. I think that's extremely arrogant on his part. CA  Can you give a specific example of how he put people's lives at risk  RL  Yeah  sure. So the things that he's disclosed  the capabilities  and the NSA is a capabilities based organization  so when we have foreign intelligence targets  legitimate things of interest    like  terrorists is the iconic example  but it includes things like human traffickers  drug traffickers  people who are trying to build advanced weaponry  nuclear weapons  and build delivery systems for those  and nation states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors  which you may have some visibility into some of that that's going on right now  the capabilities are applied in very discrete and measured and controlled ways. So the unconstrained disclosure  of those capabilities means that as adversaries see them and recognize   Hey  I might be vulnerable to this   they move away from that  and we have seen targets in terrorism  in the nation state area  in smugglers of various types  and other folks who have  because of the disclosures  moved away from our ability to have insight into what they're doing. The net effect of that is that our people who are overseas in dangerous places  whether they're diplomats or military  and our allies who are in similar situations  are at greater risk because we don't see the threats that are coming their way. CA  So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations  access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down  has been closed down. But the concern is that the nature of that access was not necessarily legitimate in the first place. I mean  describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of  access that you've spoken of. RL  So there are  when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before  use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology  and they do  because it's a great system  it's the most complex system ever devised by man  and it is a wonder  and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that  and it's just a wonderful thing. But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies. And so if I'm going to pursue them  I need to have the capability to go after them  and again  the controls are in how I apply that capability  not that I have the capability itself. Otherwise  if we could make it so that all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet  we could have a domain  badguy.com. That would be awesome  and we could just concentrate all our efforts there. That's not how it works. They're trying to hide from the government's ability to isolate and interdict their actions  and so we have to swim in that same space. But I will tell you this. So NSA has two missions. One is the Signals Intelligence mission that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press. The other one is the Information Assurance mission  which is to protect the national security systems of the United States  and by that  that's things like the communications that the president uses  the communications that control our nuclear weapons  the communications that our military uses around the world  and the communications that we use with our allies  and that some of our allies themselves use. And so we make recommendations on standards to use  and we use those same standards  and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes. CA  But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large  any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety. And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion  that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet. They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity  kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press  for example. It's the bringer of knowledge to all. It's the connector of all. And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms. And from that lens  what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought and what they read. Can you understand that from that viewpoint  it feels outrageous  RL  I do understand that  and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet  and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet. It is a global telecommunications system. The Internet is a big chunk of  that  but there is a lot more. And I think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy. That's sort of been couched as a balance between privacy and national security. I don't think that's the right framing. I think it really is transparency and secrecy. And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having  and we want to participate in that  and want people to participate in it in an informed way. So there are things  let me talk there a little bit more  there are things that we need to be transparent about  our authorities  our processes  our oversight  who we are. We  NSA  have not done a good job of that  and I think that's part of the reason that this has been so revelational and so sensational in the media. Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency  the Never Say Anything. There's takeoffs of our logo of an eagle with headphones on around it. And so that's the public characterization. And so we need to be more transparent about those things. What we don't need to be transparent about  because it's bad for the U.S.  it's bad for all those other countries that we work with and that we help provide information that helps them secure themselves and their people  it's bad to expose operations and capabilities in a way that allows the people that we're all working against  the generally recognized bad guys  to counter those. CA  But isn't it also bad to deal a kind of body blow to the American companies that have essentially given the world most of the Internet services that matter  RL  It is. It's really the companies are in a tough position  as are we  because the companies  we compel them to provide information  just like every other nation in the world does. Every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security  and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they're operating in Russia or the U.K. or China or India or France  any country that you choose to name. And so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as  you can't trust company A because your privacy is suspect with them  is actually only accurate in the sense that it's accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world. And so it's being picked up by people as a marketing advantage  and it's being marketed that  way by several countries  including some of our allied countries  where they are saying   Hey  you can't trust the U.S.  but you can trust our telecom company  because we're safe.  And they're actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that U.S. companies have in areas like the cloud and Internet based technologies. CA  You're sitting there with the American flag  and the American Constitution guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. How do you characterize the American citizen's right to privacy  Is there such a right  RL  Yeah  of course there is. And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure  inordinate and appropriate  actually I should say  amount of time and effort in order to ensure that we protect that privacy. and beyond that  the privacy of citizens around the world  it's not just Americans. Several things come into play here. First  we're all in the same network. My communications  I'm a user of a particular Internet email service that is the number one email service of choice by terrorists around the world  number one. So I'm there right beside them in email space in the Internet. And so we need to be able to pick that apart and find the information that's relevant. In doing so  we're going to necessarily encounter Americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business  and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out  that says  when you find that  not if you find it  when you find it  because you're certain to find it  here's how you protect that. These are called minimization procedures. They're approved by the attorney general and constitutionally based. And so we protect those. And then  for people  citizens of the world who are going about their lawful business on a day to day basis  the president on his January    speech  laid out some additional protections that we are providing to them. So I think absolutely  folks do have a right to privacy  and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected. CA  What about foreigners using American companies' Internet services  Do they have any privacy rights  RL  They do. They do  in the sense of  the only way that we are able to compel one of those companies to provide us information is when it falls into one of three categories  We can identify that this particular person  identified by a selector of some kind  is associated with counterterrorist or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target. CA  Much has been made of the fact that a lot of the information that you've obtained through these programs is essentially metadata. It's not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call. It's who they wrote to and when  and so forth. But it's been argued  and someone here in the audience has talked to a former NSA analyst who said metadata is actually much more invasive than the core data  because in the core data you present yourself as you want to be presented. With metadata  who knows what the conclusions are that are drawn  Is there anything to that  RL  I don't really understand that argument. I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons. Metadata is the information that lets you find connections that people are trying to hide. So when a terrorist is corresponding with somebody else who's not known to us but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity  or someone who's violating international sanctions by providing nuclear weapons related material to a country like Iran or North Korea  is trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity. What metadata lets you do is connect that. The alternative to that is one that's much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy  which is gigantic amounts of content collection. So metadata  in that sense  actually is privacy enhancing. And we don't  contrary to some of the stuff that's been printed  we don't sit there and grind out metadata profiles of average people. If you're not connected to one of those valid intelligence targets  you are not of interest to us. CA  So in terms of the threats that face America overall  where would you place terrorism  RL  I think terrorism is still number one. I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the petri dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance. An old boss of mine  Tom Fargo  Admiral Fargo  used to describe it as arcs of instability. And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability in the world right now  in places like Syria  where there's a civil war going on and you have massive numbers  thousands and thousands of foreign fighters who are coming into Syria to learn how to be terrorists and practice that activity  and lots of those people are Westerners who hold passports to European countries or in some cases the United States  and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries. You've got places like Iraq  which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence  again a breeding ground for terrorism. And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel area of Africa. Again  lots of weak governance which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity. So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one. I think number two is cyber threat. I think cyber is a threat in three ways  One way  and probably the most common way that people have heard about it  is due to the theft of intellectual property  so basically  foreign countries going in  stealing companies' secrets  and then providing that information to state owned enterprises or companies connected to the government to help them leapfrog technology or to gain business intelligence that's then used to win contracts overseas. That is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now. Several nation states are doing it. Second is the denial of service attacks. You're probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the U.S. financial sector since     . Again  that's a nation state who is executing those attacks  and they're doing that as a semi anonymous way of reprisal. And the last one is destructive attacks  and those are the ones that concern me the most. Those are on the rise. You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in       August of     . It took down about        of their computers with a Wiper style virus. You had a follow on a week later to a Qatari company. You had March of       you had a South Korean attack that was attributed in the press to North Korea that took out thousands of computers. Those are on the rise  and we see people expressing interest in those capabilities and a desire to employ them. CA  Okay  so a couple of things here  because this is really the core of this  almost. I mean  first of all  a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat. Apart from September     I think the numbers are that in the last    or    years about     Americans have died from terrorism  mostly from homegrown terrorists. The chance in the last few years of being killed by terrorism is far less than the chance of being killed by lightning. I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. Would that be the point of view  RL  Well  I'd say two things. One is  the reason that there hasn't been a major attack in the United States since       that is not an accident. That's a lot of hard work that we have done  that other folks in the intelligence community have done  that the military has done  and that our allies around the globe have done. You've heard the numbers about the tip of the iceberg in terms of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs contributed to stopping was        of those in Europe  and of those        of them occurred in three countries  some of which are our allies  and some of which are beating the heck out of us over the NSA programs  by the way. So that's not an accident that those things happen. That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence on terrorist activities and interdicting them through one way or another  through law enforcement  through cooperative activities with other countries and sometimes through military action. The other thing I would say is that your idea of nuclear or chem bio threat is not at all far fetched and in fact there are a number of groups who have for several years expressed interest and desire in obtaining those capabilities and work towards that. CA  It's also been said that  of those    alleged incidents  that as few as zero of them were actually anything to do with these controversial programs that Mr. Snowden revealed  that it was basically through other forms of intelligence  that you're looking for a needle in a haystack  and the effects of these programs  these controversial programs  is just to add hay to the stack  not to really find the needle. The needle was found by other methods. Isn't there something to that  RL  No  there's actually two programs that are typically implicated in that discussion. One is the section     program  the U.S. telephony metadata program  and the other one is popularly called the PRISM program  and it's actually section      of the FISA Amendment Act. But the     program is only relevant to threats that are directed against the United States  and there have been a dozen threats where that was implicated. Now what you'll see people say publicly is there is no  but for  case  and so there is no case where  but for that  the threat would have happened. But that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work. You think about on television  you watch a murder mystery. What do you start with  You start with a body  and then they work their way from there to solve the crime. We're actually starting well before that  hopefully before there are any bodies  and we're trying to build the case for who the people are  what they're trying to do  and that involves massive amounts of information. Think of it is as mosaic  and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic was necessary to building the mosaic  but to build the complete picture  you need to have all the pieces of information. On the other  the non U.S. related threats out of those     the other    of them  the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that  and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks. CA  Snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world  a cover for action   that it's something that  because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people  it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn't otherwise have. Is there any internal debate about that  RL  Yeah. I mean  we debate these things all the time  and there is discussion that goes on in the executive branch and within NSA itself and the intelligence community about what's right  what's proportionate  what's the correct thing to do. And it's important to note that the programs that we're talking about were all authorized by two different presidents  two different political parties  by Congress twice  and by federal judges    different times  and so this is not NSA running off and doing its own thing. This is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government  and President Madison would have been proud. CA  And yet  when congressmen discovered what was actually being done  with that authorization  many of them were completely shocked. Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction  that it's only because it's now come out publicly  that they really knew exactly what you were doing with the powers they had granted you  RL  Congress is a big body. There's     of them  and they change out frequently  in the case of the House  every two years  and I think that the NSA provided all the relevant information to our oversight committees  and then the dissemination of that information by the oversight committees throughout Congress is something that they manage. I think I would say that Congress members had the opportunity to make themselves aware  and in fact a significant number of them  the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility  did have the ability to do that. And you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public. CA  Now  you mentioned the  threat of cyberattacks  and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that that is a huge concern  but do you accept that there's a tradeoff between offensive and defensive strategies  and that it's possible that the very measures taken to   weaken encryption   and allow yourself to find the bad guys  might also open the door to forms of cyberattack  RL  So I think two things. One is  you said weaken encryption. I didn't. And the other one is that the NSA has both of those missions  and we are heavily biased towards defense  and  actually  the vulnerabilities that we find in the overwhelming majority of cases  we disclose to the people who are responsible for manufacturing or developing those products. We have a great track record of that  and we're actually working on a proposal right now to be transparent and to publish transparency reports in the same way that the Internet companies are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them. We want to be more transparent about that. So again  we eat our own dog food. We use the standards  we use the products that we recommend  and so it's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people's need to be. CA  Edward Snowden  when  after his talk  was wandering the halls here in the bot  and I heard him say to a couple of people  they asked him about what he thought of the NSA overall  and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you  said that it's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing  and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies. He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly. He didn't come over like a crazy man. Would you accept that at least  even if you disagree with how he did it  that he has opened a debate that matters  RL  So I think that the discussion is an important one to have. I do not like the way that he did it. I think there were a number of other ways that he could have done that that would have not endangered our people and the people of other nations through losing visibility into what our adversaries are doing. But I do think it's an important conversation. CA  It's been reported that there's almost a difference of opinion with you and your colleagues over any scenario in which he might be offered an amnesty deal. I think your boss  General Keith Alexander  has said that that would be a terrible example for others  you can't negotiate with someone who's broken the law in that way. But you've been quoted as saying that  if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering all undisclosed documents  that a deal maybe should be considered. Do you still think that  RL  Yeah  so actually  this is my favorite thing about that     Minutes  interview was all the misquotes that came from that. What I actually said  in  response to a question about  would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against Snowden  I said  yeah  it's worth a conversation. This is something that the attorney general of the United States and the president also actually have both talked about this  and I defer to the attorney general  because this is his lane. But there is a strong tradition in American jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to  if it benefits the government  to get something out of that  that there's always room for that kind of discussion. So I'm not presupposing any outcome  but there is always room for discussion. CA  To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U.S.  the government  you  others  in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy  a smarter way forward for the future. Do you see  has that kind of possibility been entertained at all  RL  So that's out of my lane. That's not an NSA thing. That would be a Department of Justice sort of discussion. I'll defer to them. CA  Rick  when Ed Snowden ended his talk  I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading. What would be your idea worth spreading for this group  RL  So I think  learn the facts. This is a really important conversation  and it impacts  it's not just NSA  it's not just the government  it's you  it's the Internet companies. The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government  and so learn the facts. Don't rely on headlines  don't rely on sound bites  don't rely on one sided conversations. So that's the idea  I think  worth spreading. We have a sign  a badge tab  we wear badges at work with lanyards  and if I could make a plug  my badge lanyard at work says   Dallas Cowboys.  Go Dallas. I've just alienated half the audience  I know. So the lanyard that our people who work in the organization that does our crypto analytic work have a tab that says   Look at the data.  So that's the idea worth spreading. Look at the data. CA  Rick  it took a certain amount of courage  I think  actually  to come and speak openly to this group. It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past  and plus the technology has been challenging. We truly appreciate you doing that and sharing in this very important conversation. Thank you so much. RL  Thanks  Chris. Charlie Rose  So Larry sent me an email and he basically said  we've got to make sure that  we don't seem like we're a couple of middle aged boring men. I said  I'm flattered by that    because I'm a bit older  and he has a bit more net worth than I do. Larry Page  Well  thank you. CR  So we'll have a conversation about the Internet  and we'll have a conversation Google  and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy  and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question  Where is Google and where is it going  LP  Well  this is something we think about a lot  and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say  is that really what you guys are still doing  And I always kind of think about that myself  and I'm not quite sure. But actually  when I think about search  it's such a deep thing for all of us  to really understand what you want  to understand the world's information  and we're still very much in the early stages of that  which is totally crazy. We've been at it for    years already  but it's not at all done. CR  When it's done  how will it be  LP  Well  I guess  in thinking about where we're going    you know  why is it not done     a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know  your computer doesn't know where you are  it doesn't know what you're doing  it doesn't know what you know  and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work  make them understand your context. Google Now  you know  knows where you are  knows what you may need. So really having computing  work and understand you and understand that information  we really haven't done that yet. It's still very  very clunky. CR  Tell me  when you look at what Google is doing  where does Deep Mind fit  LP  Yeah  so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First  let me tell you the way we got there  which was looking at search and really understanding  trying to understand everything  and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you    like  voice was really important. So what's the state of the art  on speech recognition  It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube  But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats  just by itself. Now  that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are  that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind  what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually    they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games  and really just  maybe I can show the video  just playing video games  and learning how to do that automatically. CR  Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things. LP  The amazing thing about this is this is  I mean  obviously  these are old games  but the system just sees what you see  the pixels  and it has the controls and it has the score  and it's learned to play all of these games  same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing  and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left  and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule  or your information needs  or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that  and that's what I'm really excited about. CR  When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing  also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we  when you look at that  LP  Well  I think for me  this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company  Demis  has a neuroscience and a computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things. CR  But where's the level of it now  And how fast do you think we are moving  LP  Well  this is the state of the art right now  understanding cats on YouTube and things like that  improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally  but I think for me  this example's really exciting  because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. CR  I don't know if we can do this  but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image  LP  Yeah. CR  There it is. Can you see the cat  Designed by machines  seen by machines. LP  That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training  no notion of a cat  but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand  and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part  it started with search  really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found. Zack Matere  Not long ago  I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started dying one after the other. I checked out the books and  they didn't tell me much. So  I went and I did a search.   Zack Matere  Farmer   Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said  sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next  he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone  I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information  but there's no follow up to that. I think the follow up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge  they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful  but it is how we use it that will define us. LP  Now  the amazing thing about that video  actually  was we just read about it in the news  and we found this gentlemen  and made that little clip. CR  When I talk to people about you  they say to me  people who know you well  say  Larry wants to change the world  and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community  and this is an example. LP  Yeah  that's right  and I think for me  I have been focusing on access more  if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually  two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost efficiently. CR  It's a balloon. LP  Yeah  get access to the Internet. CR  And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet  Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible  they didn't have to be tethered. LP  Yeah  and this is a good example of innovation. Like  we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it  but it was just really  how do we get access points up high  cheaply  You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up  and actually again  it's the power of the Internet  I did a search on it  and I found         years ago  someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought  why can't we do that today  And that's how this project got going. CR  But are you at the mercy of the wind  LP  Yeah  but it turns out  we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before  and if you control the altitude of the balloons  which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways  you can actually control roughly where they go  and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. CR  Before I talk about the future and transportation  where you've been a nerd for a while  and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles  let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that. LP  Yeah  absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think  for me  I guess  privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things  and I think you can't have privacy without security  so let me just talk about security first  because you asked about Snowden and all of that  and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me  it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from  but we do need to know what the parameters of it is  what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why  and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret. CR  Never coming to Google to ask for anything. LP  Not Google  but the public. I think we need to  have a debate about that  or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense. CR  Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. LP  Yes. The privacy side  I think it's    the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you  and that's an important thing  and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit    I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice  show them what data's being collected    search history  location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome  and doing that in more ways  just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at  on your show  actually  I kind of lost my voice  and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back. CR  If I could do anything  I would do that. LP  All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think  you know what  I look at that  I made that public  and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues  and I look at medical records  and I say  wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors  And when someone accesses your medical record  a research doctor  they could see  you could see which doctor accessed it and why  and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that  we'd save         lives this year. CR  Absolutely. Let me go    Applause  LP  So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy  we're doing the same thing we're  doing with medical records  is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater  and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways. CR  And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused. LP  Yeah  and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that  and it was a great thing to do. CR  And the response has been overwhelming. LP  Yeah  and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions  which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing. CR  So talking about the future  what is it about you and transportation systems  LP  Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost  and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems. CR  And that began the idea of an automated car. LP  Yeah  about    years ago I learned about people working on automated cars  and I became fascinated by that  and it takes a while to  get these projects going  but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's    million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under    in the U.S. CR  So you're talking about saving lives. LP  Yeah  and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads  half of the area  and most cities are not far behind  actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for. CR  And how soon will we be there  LP  I think we can be there very  very soon. We've driven well over         miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. CR  But it's not only you're talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles. LP  Well at Google  we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone  and that's been amazing  most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere  and the bikes wear out. They're getting used    hours a day. CR  But you want to put them above the street  too. LP  Well I said  how do we get people using bikes more  CR  We may have a video here. LP  Yeah  let's show the video. I just got excited about this. So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway  it looks totally crazy  but I was actually thinking about our campus  working with the Zippies and stuff  and just trying to get a lot more bike usage  and I was thinking about  how do you cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic  And I went and searched  and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this  that particular thing  but it gets your imagination going. CR  Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy  of your own mind. You have this idea of  Google X . You don't simply want to go in some small  measurable arena of progress. LP  Yeah  I think many of the things we just  talked about are like that  where they're really    I almost use the economic concept of additionality  which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless  you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that  the bigger impact you have  and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed  the more I learn about technology  the more I realize I don't know  and that's because this technological horizon  the thing that you can see to do next  the more you learn about technology  the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them. CR  What's interesting about  you too  though  for me  is that  we have lots of people who are thinking about the future  and they are going and looking and they're coming back  but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about  Tesla. The principle of that for you is what  LP  Well  I think invention is not enough. If you invent something  Tesla invented electric power that we use  but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things  where we have an innovation and invention focus  plus the ability to really    a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know  I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that  because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. CR  Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well. LP  Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did    years ago or    years ago. That's not really what we need. We need  especially in technology  we need revolutionary change  not incremental change. CR  You once said  actually  as I think I've got this about right  that you might consider  rather than giving your money  if you were leaving it to some cause  just simply giving it to Elon Musk  because you had confidence that he would change the future  and that you would therefore   LP  Yeah  if you want to go Mars  he wants to go to Mars  to back up humanity  that's a worthy goal  but it's a company  and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think  you ask  we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well  I mean  but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies  and I think it's sad  because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is  where a lot of the money is  and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are. CR  When I close conversations with lots of people  I always ask this question  What state of mind  what quality of mind is it that has served you best  People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity  and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind  as I leave this audience  has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present  LP  You know  I think the most important thing    I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said  what did they fundamentally do wrong  What did those companies all do wrong  And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think  for me  I just try to focus on that and say  what is that future really going to be and how do we create it  and how do we cause our organization  to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate  And so that's been curiosity  it's been looking at things people might not think about  working on things that no one else is working on  because that's where the additionality really is  and be willing to do that  to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future  right  That was a good thing to be working on. CR  It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you  and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks  Larry. LP  Thank you. CR  Larry Page. In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies  fathers are usually known by their sons  but I'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter  and I am proud of it. Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in       and when her efforts were honored in       and she was given the national youth peace prize  and she became a very famous  very popular young girl of her country. Before that  she was my daughter  but now I am her father. Ladies and gentlemen  if we glance to human history  the story of women is the story of injustice  inequality  violence and exploitation. You see  in patriarchal societies  right from the very beginning  when a girl is born  her birth is not celebrated. She is not welcomed  neither by father nor by mother. The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother  and nobody congratulates the father. And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child. When she gives birth to the first girl child  first daughter  she is sad. When she gives birth to the second daughter  she is shocked  and in the expectation of a son  when she gives birth to a third daughter  she feels guilty like a criminal. Not only the mother suffers  but the daughter  the newly born daughter  when she grows old  she suffers too. At the age of five  while she should be going to school  she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school. Until the age of     somehow  she has a good life. She can have fun. She can play with her friends in the streets  and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly. But when she enters her teens  when she becomes    years old  she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort. She is confined under the four walls of her home. She is no more a free individual. She becomes the so called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family  and if she transgresses the code of that so called honor  she could even be killed. And it is also interesting that this so called code of honor  it does not only affect the life of a girl  it also affects the life of the male members of the family. I know a family of seven sisters and one brother  and that one brother  he has migrated to the Gulf countries  to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents  because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood. So this brother  he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so called honor. And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience. A good girl is supposed to be very quiet  very humble and very submissive. It is the criteria. The role model good girl should be very quiet. She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders  even if she does not like them. If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man  she has to accept  because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient. If she is married very early  she has to accept. Otherwise  she will be called disobedient. And what happens at the end  In the words of a poetess  she is wedded  bedded  and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters. And it is the irony of the situation that this mother  she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons. And this vicious cycle goes on  goes on. Ladies and gentlemen  this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently  if women and men think differently  if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries  if they can break a few norms of family and society  if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states  which go against the basic human rights of the women. Dear brothers and sisters  when Malala was born  and for the first time  believe me  I don't like newborn children  to be honest  but when I went and I looked into her eyes  believe me  I got extremely honored. And long before she was born  I thought about her name  and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan. Her name was Malalai of Maiwand  and I named my daughter after her. A few days after Malala was born  my daughter was born  my cousin came    and it was a coincidence    he came to my home and he brought a family tree  a family tree of the Yousafzai family  and when I looked at the family tree  it traced back to     years of our ancestors. But when I looked  all were men  and I picked my pen  drew a line from my name  and wrote   Malala.  And when she grow old  when she was four and a half years old  I admitted her in my school. You will be asking  then  why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school  Yes  I must mention it. It may be taken for granted in Canada  in America  in many developed countries  but in poor countries  in patriarchal societies  in tribal societies  it's a big event for the life of girl. Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name. Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life. I have five sisters  and none of them could go to school  and you will be astonished  two weeks before  when I was filling out the Canadian visa form  and I was filling out the family part of the form  I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters. And the reason was that I have never  never seen the names of my sisters written on any document. That was the reason that I valued my daughter. What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters  I thought I must change it. I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter. I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come. I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings. And all these good values  I tried to inculcate in her personality. And this was not only she  only Malala. I imparted all these good values to my school  girl students  and boy students as well. I used education for emancipation. I taught my girls  I taught my girl students  to unlearn the lesson of obedience. I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so called pseudo honor. Dear brothers and sisters  we were striving for more rights for women  and we were struggling to have more  more and more space for the women in society. But we came across a new phenomenon. It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights. It was called Talibanization. It means a complete negation of women's participation in all political  economical and social activities. Hundreds of schools were lost. Girls were prohibited from going to school. Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets. Musicians were silenced  girls were flogged and singers were killed. Millions were suffering  but few spoke  and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog  and you speak for your rights. It's really the most scary thing. At the age of     Malala stood  and she stood for the right of education. She wrote a diary for the BBC blog  she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries  and she spoke from every platform she could. And her voice was the most powerful voice. It spread like a crescendo all around the world. And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign  and on October         she was shot in the head at point blank range. It was a doomsday for my family and for me. The world turned into a big black hole. While my daughter was on the verge of life and death  I whispered into the ears of my wife   Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter   And she abruptly told me   Please don't blame yourself. You stood for the right cause. You put your life at stake for the cause of truth  for the cause of peace  and for the cause of education  and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you. You both were on the right path and God will protect her.  These few words meant a lot to me  and I didn't ask this question again. When Malala was in the hospital  and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down  I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife. But my daughter never complained. She used to tell us   I'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face. I'll be okay. Please don't worry.  She was a solace for us  and she consoled us. Dear brothers and sisters  we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times  and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women  she is like any    year old girl. She cries when her homework is incomplete. She quarrels with her brothers  and I am very happy for that. People ask me  what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised  I tell them  don't ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings  and that's all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Good morning. When I was a little boy  I had an experience that changed my life  and is in fact why I'm here today. That one moment profoundly affected how I think about art  design and engineering. As background  I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world's great cities. My dad  John Ferren  who died when I was     was an artist by both passion and profession  as is my mom  Rae. He was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who  together with his contemporaries  invented American modern art  and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the   th century. Isn't it remarkable that  after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art  that modern art  comparatively speaking  is about    minutes old  yet now pervasive. As with many other important innovations  those radical ideas required no new technology  just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment  plus resiliency in the face of near universal criticism and rejection. In our home  art was everywhere. It was like oxygen  around us and necessary for life. As I watched him paint  Dad taught me that art was not about being decorative  but was a different way of communicating ideas  and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight. Given this rich artistic environment  you'd assume that I would have been compelled to go into the family business  but no. I followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy. I had no interest in becoming an artist  certainly not a painter. What I did love was electronics and machines    taking them apart  building new ones  and making them work. Fortunately  my family also had engineers in it  and with my parents  these were my first role models. What they all had in common was they worked very  very hard. My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn. On weekends  we would go together to Cortlandt Street  which was New York City's radio row. There we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics  and for a few bucks bring home treasures like Norden bombsights and parts from the first IBM tube based computers. I found these objects both useful and fascinating. I learned about engineering and how things worked  not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices. I did this for hours every day  apparently avoiding electrocution. Life was good. However  every summer  sadly  the machines got left behind while my parents and I traveled overseas to experience history  art and design. We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East  but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology  they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum  where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology. Then  when I was about nine years old  we went to Rome. On one particularly hot summer day  we visited a drum shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting. My dad said it was called the Pantheon  a temple for all of the gods. It didn't look all that special from the outside  as I said  but when we walked inside  I was immediately struck by three things  First of all  it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside. It was very dark  the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof. Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole  but it was called the oculus  an eye to the heavens. And there was something about this place  I didn't know why  that just felt special. As we walked to the center of the room  I looked up at the heavens through the oculus. This was the first church that I'd been to that provided an unrestricted view between God and man. But I wondered  what about when it rained  Dad may have called this an oculus  but it was  in fact  a big hole in the roof. I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor. As I became more accustomed to the dark  I was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls. No big deal here  just the same statuary stuff that we'd seen all over Rome. In fact  it looked like the Appian Way marble salesman showed up with his sample book  showed it to Hadrian  and Hadrian said   We'll take all of it.  But the ceiling was amazing. It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome. I'd seen these before  and Bucky was friends with my dad. It was modern  high tech  impressive  a huge     foot clear span which  not coincidentally  was exactly its height. I loved this place. It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before  so I asked my dad   When was this built   He said   About       years ago.  And I said   No  I mean  the roof.  You see  I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long past war. He said   It's the original roof.  That moment changed my life  and I can remember it as if it were yesterday. For the first time  I realized people were smart       years ago.  Laughter  This had never crossed my mind. I mean  to me  the pyramids at Giza  we visited those the year before  and sure they're impressive  nice enough design  but look  give me an unlimited budget         to        laborers  and about    to    years to cut and drag stone blocks  across the countryside  and I'll build you pyramids too. But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon  not       years ago  nor today. And incidentally  it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built. To build the Pantheon took some miracles. By miracles  I mean things that are technically barely possible  very high risk  and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time  certainly not by you. For example  here are some of the Pantheon's miracles. To make it even structurally possible  they had to invent super strong concrete  and to control weight  varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome. For strength and lightness  the dome structure used five rings of coffers  each of diminishing size  which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design. It was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass  natural convection of air rising up through the oculus  and a Venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building. I discovered for the first time that light itself has substance. The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable  and I realized for the first time that light could be designed. Further  that of all of the forms of design  visual design  they were all kind of irrelevant without it  because without light  you can't see any of them. I also realized that I wasn't the first person to think that this place was really special. It survived gravity  barbarians  looters  developers and the ravages of time to become what I believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history. Largely because of that visit  I came to understand that  contrary to what I was being told in school  the worlds of art and design were not  in fact  incompatible with science and engineering. I realized  when combined  you could create things that were amazing that couldn't be done in either domain alone. But in school  with few exceptions  they were treated as separate worlds  and they still are. My teachers told me that I had to get serious and focus on one or the other. However  urging me to specialize only caused me to really  appreciate those polymaths like Michelangelo  Leonardo da Vinci  Benjamin Franklin  people who did exactly the opposite. And this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds. So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the Pantheon actually happen  Someone themselves  perhaps Hadrian  needed a brilliant creative vision. They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it  and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther. It is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles. The problem is  no matter how talented  rich or smart you are  you only get one to one and a half miracles. That's it. That's the quota. Then you run out of time  money  enthusiasm  whatever. Remember  most people can't even imagine one of these technical miracles  and you need at least five to make a Pantheon. In my experience  these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of art  design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach. Driven by the clarity of their vision  they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features. Take the oculus of the Pantheon. By insisting that it be in the design  it meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology that had been developed for Roman arches. However  by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution  they came up with a design that only works if there's a big hole in the roof. That done  you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of light  cooling and that critical direct connection with the heavens. Not bad. These people not only believed that the impossible can be done  but that it must be done. Enough ancient history. What are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now  Well  putting a man on the moon was a good one  and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either. Talk about one giant leap  It's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another. So what came after the moon  One is tempted to say that today's pantheon is the Internet  but I actually think that's quite wrong  or at least it's only part of the story. The Internet isn't a Pantheon. It's more like the invention of concrete  important  absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon  and enduring  but entirely insufficient by itself. However  just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon  new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure. The smartphone is a perfect example. Soon the majority of people on the planet will have one  and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure. So what's next  What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon  Thinking about this  I rejected many very plausible and dramatic breakthroughs to come  such as curing cancer. Why  Because Pantheons are anchored in designed physical objects  ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them  and will continue to do so indefinitely. It is a different kind of language  like art. These other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are  of course  critical  and fantastic  but they're part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology  like the Internet. So what is next  Perhaps counterintuitively  I'm guessing it's a visionary idea from the late     s that's been revived every decade since  autonomous vehicles. Now you're thinking  give me a break. How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound  Look  much of our world has been designed around  roads and transportation. These were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the United States. Today  these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for     years. Although perhaps not obvious today  autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and  by extension  civilization. Here's why  Once they become ubiquitous  each year  these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone and a million globally. Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically. Much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear. They will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities  work  and the way we live. We will get where we're going faster and society will recapture vast amounts of lost productivity now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting. But why now  Why do we think this is ready  Because over the last    years  people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles  but for entirely different purposes. It took folks like DARPA  universities  and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it  autonomy could be done now. So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles  One  you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is. This was solved neatly by the GPS system  Global Positioning System  that the U.S. Government put in place. You need to know where all the roads are  what the rules are  and where you're going. The various needs of personal navigation systems  in car navigation systems  and web based maps address this. You must have near continuous communication with high performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent. The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices  with some minor modifications  are completely suitable to solve this. You'll probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this. This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there. But finally  you need to recognize people  signs and objects. Machine vision  special sensors  and high performance computing can do a lot of this  but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board. Occasionally  humans will  need to do sense making. For this  you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road. Not so bad  and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world. Besides  once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant  and it's okay to keep driving  every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on. Five miracles  mostly delivered  and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful  and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home. The beginning is now only a handful of years away  and I predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades. In conclusion  I've come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us  just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge  multidisciplinary skills  and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality. But these people don't spontaneously pop into existence. They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they're little kids. We need to love them and help them discover their passions. We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success  as is perseverance. We need to help them to find their own role models  and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible  and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus  and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums  we need to encourage them to find their own path  even if it's very different from our own. But a cautionary note  We also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles  the computers  phones  tablets  game machines and TVs  take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world  our planet and our civilization. If we don't  they won't understand what these precious things are that someday they will be resopnsible for protecting and improving. We also need them to understand something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech dependent world  that art and design are not luxuries  nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering. They are in fact essential to what makes us special. Someday  if you get the chance  perhaps you can take your kids to the actual Pantheon  as we will our daughter Kira  to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design  which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome  reached       years into the future to set the course for my life. Thank you. A herd of wildebeests  a shoal of fish  a flock of birds. Many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world. But why do these groups form  The common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs or gathering to mate or breed  and all of these explanations  while often true  make a huge assumption about animal behavior  that the animals are in control of their own actions  that they are in charge of their bodies. And that is often not the case. This is Artemia  a brine shrimp. You probably know it better as a sea monkey. It's small  and it typically lives alone  but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters  and these form because of a parasite. These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm. A tapeworm is effectively a long  living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other. As a freelance journalist  I sympathize. The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body  but it also does other things. It castrates them  it changes their color from transparent to bright red  it makes them live longer  and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found  it makes them swim in groups. Why  Because the tapeworm  like many other parasites  has a complicated life cycle involving many different hosts. The shrimp are just one step on its journey. Its ultimate destination is this  the greater flamingo. Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce  so to get there  it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour  and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm. They aren't sociable through their own volition  but because they are being controlled. It's not safety in numbers. It's actually the exact opposite. The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies  turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo. And here is another example of a parasitic manipulation. This is a suicidal cricket. This cricket swallowed the  larvae of a Gordian worm  or horsehair worm. The worm grew to adult size within it  but it needs to get into water in order to mate  and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain  causing it to behave erratically. When the cricket nears a body of water  such as this swimming pool  it jumps in and drowns  and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse. Crickets are really roomy. Who knew  The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone. They are part of an entire cavalcade of mind controlling parasites  of fungi  viruses  and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts. Now  I first learned about this way of life through David Attenborough's  Trials of Life  about    years ago  and then later through a wonderful book called  Parasite Rex  by my friend Carl Zimmer. And I've been writing about these creatures ever since. Few topics in biology enthrall me more. It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain. Because after all  they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre. When you write about parasites  your lexicon swells with phrases like  devoured alive  and  bursts out of its body.  But there's more to it than that. I'm a writer  and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories. Parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories. Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations. Why  for example  does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over  Is it maybe protecting its siblings  No. This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it. The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body. See what I mean  Now  the caterpillar didn't die. Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons. This caterpillar is a head banging  zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it. We have a lot to get through.  I only have    minutes.  Laughter  Now  some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world  that they are outliers  and that point of view is understandable  because by their nature  parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things. They're easy to overlook  but that doesn't mean that they aren't important. A few years back  a man called Kevin Lafferty took a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find  and what they found were parasites in extreme abundance. Especially common were trematodes  tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail. Now  a single trematode is tiny  microscopic  but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds. And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you  the cricket thing  One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato found that in one stream  these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some    percent of the diet of local trout. Manipulation is not an oddity. It is a critical and common part of the world around us  and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators  and more excitingly  they're starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts. And this is one of my favorite examples. This is Ampulex compressa  the emerald cockroach wasp  and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach. When she finds one  she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ. This discovery came out three weeks ago. She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach's brain. So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag  she finds the brain  and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons. Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon. It doesn't kill the roach  nor does it sedate it. The roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to  but it doesn't choose to  because the venom nixes its motivation to walk  and only that. The wasp basically un checks the escape from danger box in the roach's operating system  allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog. And once there  she lays an egg on it  egg hatches  devoured alive  bursts out of body  yadda yadda yadda  you know the drill. Now I would argue that  once stung  the cockroach isn't a roach anymore. It's more of an extension of the wasp  just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm. These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce. They have as much control over their own fates as my car. Once the parasites get in  the hosts don't get a say. Now humans  of course  are no stranger to manipulation. We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods  and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind  But our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine grained specificity of the parasites. Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp. Now  I think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling. We place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears. Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and mind controlling supervillains    these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction  but in nature  they happen all the time. Which leads me to an obvious and disquieting question  Are there dark  sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it  besides the NSA  If there are any   I've got a red dot on my forehead now  don't I  If there are any  this is a good candidate for them. This is Toxoplasma gondii  or Toxo  for short  because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname. Toxo infects mammals  a wide variety of mammals  but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat. And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse  it turns the rodent into a cat seeking missile. If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss  it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away. The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex. It's a classic tale of Eat  Prey  Love. You're very charitable  generous people. Hi  Elizabeth  I loved your talk. How does the parasite control its host in this way  We don't really know. We know that Toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine  a substance involved in reward and motivation. We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain  including those involved in sexual arousal. But how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear. What is clear is that this thing is a single cell. This has no nervous system. It has no consciousness. It doesn't even have a body. But it's manipulating a mammal  We are mammals. We are more intelligent than a mere rat  to be sure  but our brains have the same basic structure  the same types of cells  the same chemicals running through them  and the same parasites. Estimates vary a lot  but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains. Now typically  this doesn't lead to any overt illness. The parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time. But there's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people  that they have a slightly  higher risk of car accidents  and there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected. Now  I think this evidence is still inconclusive  and even among Toxo researchers  opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior. But given the widespread nature of such manipulations  it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren't similarly affected. And I think that this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing. They're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways  and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing  whether they're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling  are not the results of individuals acting through their own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else. And while that idea may be disquieting  and while parasites' habits may be very grisly  I think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin. At the end of  On the Origin of Species   Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life  and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful  and I like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks. But perhaps  that's just a parasite talking. Thank you. My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust  protect user rights and keep users safe  both from each other and  at times  from themselves. Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter. Back in January       we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform. January       more than     million. We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes. That's a        percent increase. Now  the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. There's no risk involved. My job is to root out and prevent activity that might. Sounds straightforward  right  You might even think it'd be easy  given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities  Given the scale that Twitter is at  a one in a million chance happens     times a day. It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale. For us  edge cases  those rare situations that are unlikely to occur  are more like norms. Say   .    percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone. There's no threat involved. Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef  or tweeting about a concert they're attending  or sharing pictures of cute baby animals. After you take out that   .    percent  that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly         per month. The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge. You know what else makes my role particularly challenging  People do weird things. And I have to figure out what they're doing  why  and whether or not there's risk involved  often without much in terms of context or background. I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter    these are all real examples   of situations that at first seemed cut and dried  but the truth of the matter was something altogether different. The details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty. We'll start off easy.   Yo bitch   If you saw a Tweet that only said this  you might think to yourself   That looks like abuse.  After all  why would you want to receive the message   Yo  bitch.  Now  I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes  so I knew that  yo  bitch  was also often a common greeting between friends  as well as being a popular  Breaking Bad  reference. I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case. It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role playing as dogs. And in fact  in that case  it's not only not abusive  it's technically just an accurate greeting. So okay  determining whether or not something is abusive without context  definitely hard. Let's look at spam. Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior  sending the exact same message to thousands of people. While this is a mockup I put together using my account  we see accounts doing this all the time. Seems pretty straightforward. We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior. Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule. Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it. You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam. Okay. Let's make the stakes higher. Back to my account  again exhibiting classic behavior. This time it's sending the same message and link. This is often indicative of  something called phishing  somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website. That's pretty clearly not a good thing. We want to  and do  suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior. So why are the stakes higher for this  Well  this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening. We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it. That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors  and even then  we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate. Now  given the sorts of challenges I'm up against  it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected. And that's not just an issue for me  or for Twitter  it's an issue for you. It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things. So what do I do  I pause and I think  how could all of this go horribly wrong  I visualize catastrophe. And that's hard. There's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that  like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement. But you still have to do it  particularly if you're marrying      million tweets per day. What do I mean by  visualize catastrophe   I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death  and what to do to prevent that. Which happens to be my next example. This is my cat  Eli. We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets. A picture is worth a thousand words. You only get     characters. You add a photo to your tweet  look at how much more content you've got now. There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet. My job isn't to think of those. It's to think of what could go wrong. How could this picture lead to my death  Well  here's one possibility. There's more in that picture than just a cat. There's geodata. When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera  there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image. In fact  this image also contains the equivalent of this  more specifically  this. Sure  it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat  but I start by assuming the worst will happen. That's why  when we launched photos on Twitter  we made the decision to strip that geodata out. If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards  I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases. Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen  it wouldn't be surprising if  my worldview was gloomy. It's not. The vast majority of interactions I see    and I see a lot  believe me    are positive  people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other. It's just that for those of us dealing with scale  for those of us tasked with keeping people safe  we have to assume the worst will happen  because for us  a one in a million chance is pretty good odds. Thank you. Looking deeply inside nature  through the magnifying glass of science  designers extract principles  processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design methodology. From synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials  to computational methods that emulate neural processes  nature is driving design. Design is also driving nature. In realms of genetics  regenerative medicine and synthetic biology  designers are growing novel technologies  not foreseen or anticipated by nature. Bionics explores the interplay between biology and design. As you can see  my legs are bionic. Today  I will tell human stories of bionic integration  how electromechanics attached to the body  and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability  between human limitation and human potential. Bionics has defined my physicality. In       both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite  incurred during a mountain climbing accident. At that time  I didn't view my body as broken. I reasoned that a human being can never be  broken.  Technology is broken. Technology is inadequate. This simple but powerful idea was a call to arms  to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability  and ultimately  the disability of others. I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing. I quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable  able to take on any form  any function    a blank slate for which to create  perhaps  structures that could extend beyond biological capability. I made my height adjustable. I could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like. So when I was feeling bad about myself  insecure  I would jack my height up. But when I was feeling confident and suave  I would knock my height down a notch  just to give the competition a chance. Narrow edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures  where the human foot cannot penetrate  and spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls  without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue. Through technological innovation  I returned to my sport  stronger and better. Technology had eliminated my disability  and allowed me a new climbing prowess. As a young man  I imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability  a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see. A world in which the paralyzed could walk  via body exoskeletons. Sadly  because of deficiencies in technology  disability is rampant in the world. This gentleman is missing three limbs. As a testimony to current technology  he is out of the wheelchair  but we need to do a better job in bionics  to allow  one day  full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury. At the MIT Media Lab  we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics. The mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans  across a broad range of brain and body disabilities. Today  I'm going to tell you how my legs function  how they work  as a case in point for this center. Now  I made sure to shave my legs last night  because I knew I'd be showing them off. Bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces. There's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs  mechanical  how my limbs are attached to my biological body  dynamic  how they move like flesh and bone  and electrical  how they communicate with my nervous system. I'll begin with mechanical interface. In the area of design  we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically. It's extraordinary to me that in this day and age  one of the most mature  oldest technologies in the human timeline  the shoe  still gives us blisters. How can this be  We have no idea how to attach things to our bodies. This is the beautifully lyrical design work of Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab  showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances  shown here by color variation in this  D printed model. Imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it  when you need it  for optimal support and flexibility  without ever causing discomfort. My bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations  that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics. To achieve that mirroring  we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb. To that end  we used imaging tools such as MRI  to look inside my body  to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues. We also took robotic tools    here's a    actuator circle that goes around the biological limb. The actuators come in  find the surface of the limb  measure its unloaded shape  and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point. We combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my biological limb  shown on the left. You see a bunch of points  or nodes  At each node  there's a color that represents tissue compliance. We then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin  shown on the right. And we've discovered optimality is  where the body is stiff  the synthetic skin should be soft  where the body is soft  the synthetic skin is stiff  and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances. With this framework  we've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn. Clearly  in the future  our clothing  our shoes  our braces  our prostheses  will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies  but rather  data driven quantitative frameworks. In that future  our shoes will no longer give us blisters. We're also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins. This is a material developed by SRI International  California. Under electrostatic effect  it changes stiffness. So under zero voltage  the material is compliant  it's floppy like paper. Then the button's pushed  a voltage is applied  and it becomes stiff as a board. We embed this material into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body. When I walk here  it's no voltage. My interface is soft and compliant. The button's pushed  voltage is applied  and it stiffens  offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb. We're also building exoskeletons. This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle  to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation. In the future  we'll all be wearing exoskeletons in common activities  such as running. Next  dynamic interface. How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone  At my MIT lab  we study how humans with normal physiologies stand  walk and run. What are the muscles doing  and how are they controlled by the spinal cord  This basic science motivates what we build. We're building bionic ankles  knees and hips. We're building body parts from the ground up. The bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs. They've been fitted to nearly       patients      of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers. How does it work  At heel strike  under computer control  the system controls stiffness  to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground. Then at mid stance  the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride  comparable to how muscles work in the calf region. This bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients. So on the left  you see the bionic device worn by a lady  on the right  a passive device worn by the same lady  that fails to emulate normal muscle function  enabling her to do something everyone should be able to do  go up and down their steps at home. Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats. Here's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway. This is Steve Martin    not the comedian    who lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan. We're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles  that wrap around the biological limb. This gentleman does not have any leg condition  any disability. He has a normal physiology  so these exoskeletons are applying muscle like torques and powers  so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers. This is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking. It significantly reduces metabolic cost. It's so profound in its augmentation  that when a normal  healthy person wears the device for    minutes and then takes it off  their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward. We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient. Moving on to electrical interface  How do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system  Across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles. That's communicated to the bionic limb  so when I think about moving my phantom limb  the robot tracks those movement desires. This diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled. So we model the missing biological limb  and we've discovered what reflexes occurred  how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles. And that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb. What we've done  then  is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex  the modeled spinal reflex  with the neural signal  so when I relax my muscles in my residual limb  I get very little torque and power  but the more I fire my muscles  the more torque I get  and I can even run. And that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command. Feels great. We want to go a step further. We want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb. We're doing experiments where we're growing nerves  transected nerves  through channels  or micro channel arrays. On the other side of the channel  the nerve then attaches to cells  skin cells and muscle cells. In the motor channels  we can sense how the person wishes to move. That can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb  then  sensory information  on the bionic limb can be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels  sensory channels. So when this is fully developed and for human use  persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone  but actually feel like flesh and bone. This video shows Lisa Mallette  shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs. Indeed  bionics is making a profound difference in people's lives. LM  Oh my God  I can't believe it  LM  It's just like I've got a real leg  Woman  Now  don't start running. Man  Now turn around  and do the same thing walking up  but get on your heel to toe  like you would normally just walk on level ground. Try to walk right up the hill. LM  Oh my God. Man  Is it pushing you up  LM  Yes  I'm not even    I can't even describe it. Man  It's pushing you right up. Hugh Herr  Next week  I'm visiting the Center    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  and I'm going to try to convince CMS to grant appropriate code language and pricing  so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it. Thank you. It's not well appreciated  but over half of the world's population suffers from some form of cognitive  emotional  sensory or motor condition  and because of poor technology  too often  conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life. Basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights. Every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose    the right to live life without severe depression  the right to see a loved one  in the case of seeing impaired  or the right to walk or to dance  in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation. As a society  we can achieve these human rights  if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our built environment  our technologies  are broken and disabled. We the people need not accept our limitations  but can transcend disability through technological innovation. Indeed  through fundamental advances in bionics in this century  we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience  and we will end disability. I'd like to finish up with one more story  a beautiful story. The story of Adrianne Haslet Davis. Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack. I met Adrianne when this photo was taken  at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Adrianne is a dancer  a ballroom dancer. Adrianne breathes and lives dance. It is her expression. It is her art form. Naturally  when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack  she wanted to return to the dance floor. After meeting her and driving home in my car  I thought  I'm an MIT professor. I have resources. Let's build her a bionic limb  to enable her to go back to her life of dance. I brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics  robotics  machine learning and biomechanics  and over a     day research period  we studied dance. We brought in dancers with biological limbs  and we studied how they move  what forces they apply on the dance floor  and we took those data  and we put forth fundamental principles of dance  reflexive dance capability  and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb. Bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster. Our expression  our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics. It was  .  seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack. In  .  seconds  the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor. In     days  we put her back. We will not be intimidated  brought down  diminished  conquered or stopped by acts of violence. Ladies and gentlemen  please allow me to introduce Adrianne Haslet Davis  her first performance since the attack. She's dancing with Christian Lightner. Ladies and gentlemen  members of the research team  Elliott Rouse and Nathan Villagaray Carski. Elliott and Nathan. The world makes you something that you're not  but you know inside what you are  and that question burns in your heart  How will you become that  I may be somewhat unique in this  but I am not alone  not alone at all. So when I became a fashion model  I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream that I'd always wanted since I was a young child. My outside self finally matched my inner truth  my inner self. For complicated reasons which I'll get to later  when I look at this picture  at that time I felt like  Geena  you've done it  you've made it  you have arrived. But this past October  I realized that I'm only just beginning. All of us are put in boxes by our family  by our religion  by our society  our moment in history  even our own bodies. Some people have the courage to break free  not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the beliefs of those that surround them. Those people are always the threat to the status quo  to what is considered acceptable. In my case  for the last nine years  some of my neighbors  some of my friends  colleagues  even my agent  did not know about my history. I think  in mystery  this is called the reveal. Here is mine. I was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my genitalia. I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house  I would always wear this t shirt on my head. And my mom asked me   How come you always wear that t shirt on your head   I said   Mom  this is my hair. I'm a girl.  I knew then how to self identify. Gender has always been considered a fact  immutable  but we now know it's actually more fluid  complex and mysterious. Because of my success  I never had the courage to share my story  not because I thought what I am is wrong  but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free. Every day  I am so grateful because I am a woman. I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am. Many are not so fortunate. There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender. There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion. There is a Hindu goddess  hijra goddess. So when I was eight years old  I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries. I was in front of the stage  and I remember  out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me  and I remember that moment something hit me  That is the kind of woman I would like to be. So when I was    years old  still dressing as a boy  I met this woman named T.L. She is a transgender beauty pageant manager. That night she asked me   How come you are not joining the beauty pageant   She convinced me that if I joined that she would take care of the registration fee and the garments  and that night  I won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among    plus candidates. That moment changed my life. All of a sudden  I was introduced to the world of beauty pageants. Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women  but I'll take it. So from    to    years old  I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck  literally  or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field  and when it rains    it rains a lot in the Philippines    the organizers would have to move it inside someone's house. I also experienced the goodness of strangers  especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the Philippines. But most importantly  I met some of my best friends in that community. In       my mom  who had moved to San Francisco  called me and told me that my green card petition came through  that I could now move to the United States. I resisted it. I told my mom   Mom  I'm having fun. I'm here with my friends  I love traveling  being a beauty pageant queen.  But then two weeks later she called me  she said   Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker   That was all I needed to hear. My mom also told me to put two E's in the spelling of my name. She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at    years old. It's interesting  in some of the most rural cities in Thailand  they perform some of the most prestigious  safe and sophisticated surgery. At that time in the United States  you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker. So in       I moved to San Francisco  and I remember looking at my California driver's license with the name Geena and gender marker F. That was a powerful moment. For some people  their I.D. is their license to drive or even to get a drink  but for me  that was my license to live  to feel dignified. All of a sudden  my fears were minimized. I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York and be a model. Many are not so fortunate. I think of this woman named Islan Nettles. She's from New York  she's a young woman who was courageously living her truth  but hatred ended her life. For most of my community  this is the reality in which we live. Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population. Every November     we have a global vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance. I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice. This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Today  this very moment  is my real coming out. I could no longer live my truth for and by myself. I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror. I am here  exposed  so that one day there will never be a need for a November    vigil. My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am. Will you  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Kathryn Schulz  Geena  one quick question for you. I'm wondering what you would say  especially to parents  but in a more broad way  to friends  to family  to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that's being assigned them  what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them  Geena Rocero  Sure. Well  first  really  I'm so blessed. The support system  with my mom especially  and my family  that in itself is just so powerful. I remember every time I would coach young trans women  I would mentor them  and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can't accept it  I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom   Mom  can you call this woman   And sometimes it works  sometimes it doesn't  so   But it's just  gender identity is in the core of our being  right  I mean  we're all assigned gender at birth  so what I'm trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match  and there should be a space that would allow people to self identify  and that's a conversation that we should have with parents  with colleagues. The transgender movement  it's at the very beginning  to compare to how the gay movement started. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. There should be an understanding. There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions  and I hope all of you guys will be my allies. KS  Thank you. That was so lovely. GR  Thank you. Daffodil Hudson  Hello  Yeah  this is she.

Brought to you by TED staff and friends   If you look deep into the night sky  you see stars  and if you look further  you see more stars  and further  galaxies  and  further  more galaxies. But if you keep looking further and further  eventually you see nothing for a long while  and then finally you see a faint  fading afterglow  and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang. Now  the Big Bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small  incredibly hot  incredibly roiling mass  and from it sprung everything we see. Now  we've mapped that afterglow with great precision  and when I say we  I mean people who aren't me. We've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision  and one of the shocks about it is that it's almost completely uniform. Fourteen billion light years that way and    billion light years that way  it's the same temperature. Now it's been    billion years since that Big Bang  and so it's got faint and cold. It's now  .  degrees. But it's not exactly  .  degrees. It's only  .  degrees to about    parts in a million. Over here  it's a little hotter  and over there  it's a little cooler  and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room  because where it was a little hotter  there was a little more stuff  and where there was a little more stuff  we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies and superclusters and all the structure you see in the cosmos. And those small  little  inhomogeneities     parts in a million  those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos. That is spectacular  and that's not what they found on Monday  what they found on Monday is cooler. So here's what they found on Monday  Imagine you take a bell  and you whack the bell with a hammer. What happens  It rings. But if you wait  that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don't notice it anymore. Now  that early universe was incredibly dense  like a metal  way denser  and if you hit it  it would ring  but the thing ringing would be the structure of space time itself  and the hammer would be quantum mechanics. What they found on Monday was evidence of the ringing of the space time of the early universe  what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era  and here's how they found it. Those waves have long since faded. If you go for a walk  you don't wiggle. Those gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes. But early on  when the universe was making that last afterglow  the gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see. So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper    in fact  these guys spent three years on the South Pole looking straight up through the coldest  clearest  cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol  the signal  of gravitational waves  the ringing of the early universe. And on Monday  they announced that they had found it. And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing  though that is awesome. The thing that's totally amazing  the reason I'm on this stage  is because what that tells us is something deep about the early universe. It tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble    and this is the idea of inflation  one large bubble surrounded by something else. This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation  but anything that isn't inflation that explains this will look the same. This is a theory  an idea  that has been around for a while  and we never thought we we'd really see it. For good reasons  we thought we'd never see killer evidence  and this is killer evidence. But the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger  roiling pot of universal stuff. We're never going to see the stuff outside  but by going to the South Pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky  we can figure out that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that. And that amazes me. Thanks a lot. Chris Anderson  So  this is an interview with a difference. On the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words  what I did was  I asked Bill and Melinda to dig out from their archive some images that would help explain some of what they've done  and do a few things that way. So  we're going to start here. Melinda  when and where was this  and who is that handsome man next to you  Melinda Gates  With those big glasses  huh  This is in Africa  our very first trip  the first time either of us had ever been to Africa  in the fall of     . We were already engaged to be married. We married a few months later  and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna. It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time off from work. But what really touched us  actually  were the people  and the extreme poverty. We started asking ourselves questions. Does it have to be like this  And at the end of the trip  we went out to Zanzibar  and took some time to walk on the beach  which is something we had done a lot while we were dating. And we'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from Microsoft would be given back to society  but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about  well  what might we do and how might we go about it  CA  So  given that this vacation led to the creation of the world's biggest private foundation  it's pretty expensive as vacations go.  Laughter  MG  I guess so. We enjoyed it. CA  Which of you was the key instigator here  or was it symmetrical  Bill Gates  Well  I think we were excited that there'd be a phase of our life where we'd get to work together and figure out how to give this money back. At this stage  we were talking about the poorest  and could you have a big impact on them  Were there things that weren't being done  There was a lot we didn't know. Our na vet  is pretty incredible  when we look back on it. But we had a certain enthusiasm that that would be the phase  the post Microsoft phase would be our philanthropy. MG  Which Bill always thought was going to come after he was     so he hasn't quite hit    yet  so some things change along the way. CA  So it started there  but it got accelerated. So that was '    and it was '    really  before the foundation itself started. MA  Yeah  in '    we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world  and we kept saying to ourselves   Well that can't be. In the U.S.  you just go down to the drug store.  And so we started gathering scientists and started learning about population  learning about vaccines  learning about what had worked and what had failed  and that's really when we got going  was in late           . CA  So  you've got a big pot of money and a world full of so many different issues. How on Earth do you decide what to focus on  BG  Well  we decided that we'd pick two causes  whatever the biggest inequity was globally  and there we looked at children dying  children not having enough nutrition to ever develop  and countries that were really stuck  because with that level of death  and parents would have so many kids that they'd get huge population growth  and that the kids were so sick that they really couldn't be educated and lift themselves up. So that was our global thing  and then in the U.S.  both of us have had amazing educations  and we saw that as the way that the U.S. could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system  and the more we learned  the more we realized we're not really fulfilling that promise. And so we picked those two things  and everything the foundation does is focused there. CA  So  I asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work  and Melinda  this is what you picked. What's this about  MG  So I  one of the things I love to do when I travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women  whether it's Bangladesh  India  lots of countries in Africa  and I go in as a Western woman without a name. I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis. And I kept hearing from women  over and over and over  the more I traveled   I want to be able to use this shot.  I would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines  and they would bring the conversation around to  But what about the shot I get   which is an injection they were getting called Depo Provera  which is a contraceptive. And I would come back and talk to global health experts  and they'd say   Oh no  contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world.  Well  you had to dig deeper into the reports  and this is what the team came to me with  which is  to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use stocked out more than     days a year explains why women were saying to me   I walked    kilometers without my husband knowing it  and I got to the clinic  and there was nothing there.  And so condoms were stocked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U.S. and others supported. But women will tell you over and over again   I can't negotiate a condom with my husband. I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS  and I need that tool because then I can space the births of my children  and I can feed them and have a chance of educating them.  CA  Melinda  you're Roman Catholic  and you've often been embroiled in controversy over this issue  and on the abortion question  on both sides  really. How do you navigate that  MG  Yeah  so I think that's a really important point  which is  we had backed away from contraceptives as a global community. We knew that     million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives  even the contraceptives we have here in the United States  and we weren't providing them because of the political controversy in our country  and to me that was just a crime  and I kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage  and I finally realized I just had to do it. And even though I'm Catholic  I believe in contraceptives just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives  and I shouldn't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back. We used to have consensus in the United States around contraceptives  and so we got back to that global consensus  and actually raised  .  billion dollars around exactly this issue for women. CA  Bill  this is your graph. What's this about  BG  Well  my graph has numbers on it. I really like this graph. This is the number of children who die before the age of five every year. And what you find is really a phenomenal success story which is not widely known  that we are making incredible progress. We go from    million not long after I was born to now we're down to about six million. So this is a story largely of vaccines. Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year. That was eradicated  so that got down to zero. Measles was killing a couple million a year. That's down to a few hundred thousand. Anyway  this is a chart where you want to get that number to continue  and it's going to be possible  using the science of new vaccines  getting the vaccines out to kids. We can actually accelerate the progress. The last decade  that number has dropped faster than ever in history  and so I just love the fact that you can say  okay  if we can invent new vaccines  we can get them out there  use the very latest understanding of these things  and get the delivery right  that we can perform a miracle. CA  I mean  you do the math on this  and it works out  I think  literally to thousands of kids' lives saved every day compared to the prior year. It's not reported. An airliner with     plus deaths is a far  far bigger story than that. Does that drive you crazy  BG  Yeah  because it's a silent thing going on. It's a kid  one kid at a time. Ninety eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters  and yet  people's charity  when they see a natural disaster  are wonderful. It's incredible how people think  okay  that could be me  and the money flows. These causes have been a bit invisible. Now that the Millennium Development Goals and various things are getting out there  we are seeing some increased generosity  so the goal is to get this well below a million  which should be possible in our lifetime. CA  Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big  sad face to get engaged. I mean  you've used it in your letter this year  you used basically this argument to say that aid  contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken  that actually it has been effective. BG  Yeah  well people can take  there is some aid that was well meaning and didn't go well. There's some venture capital investments that were well meaning and didn't go well. You shouldn't just say  okay  because of that  because we don't have a perfect record  this is a bad endeavor. You should look at  what was your goal  How are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves  and say wow  this is going well  and be smarter. We can spend aid smarter. It is not all a panacea. We can do better than venture capital  I think  including big hits like this. CA  Traditional wisdom is that it's pretty hard for married couples to work together. How have you guys managed it  MG  Yeah  I've had a lot of women say to me   I really don't think I could work with my husband. That just wouldn't work out.  You know  we enjoy it  and we don't    this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey  and we don't travel together as much for the foundation  actually  as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft. We have more trips where we're traveling separately  but I always know when I come home  Bill's going to be interested in what I learned  whether it's about women or girls or something new about the vaccine delivery chain  or this person that is a great leader. He's going to listen and be really interested. And he knows when he comes home  even if it's to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he's learned  I'm really interested  and I think we have a really collaborative relationship. But we don't every minute together  that's for sure. CA  But now you are  and we're very happy that you are. Melinda  early on  you were basically largely running the show. Six years ago  I guess  Bill came on full time  so moved from Microsoft and became full time. That must have been hard  adjusting to that. No  MG  Yeah. I think actually  for the foundation employees  there was way more angst for them than there was for me about Bill coming. I was actually really excited. I mean  Bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in       and it was really his decision  but again  it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea. And for me  the excitement of Bill putting his brain and his heart against these huge global problems  these inequities  to me that was exciting. Yes  the foundation employees had angst about that. CA  That's cool. MG  But that went away within three months  once he was there. BG  Including some of the employees. MG  That's what I said  the employees  it went away for them three months after you were there. BG  No  I'm kidding. MG  Oh  you mean  the employees didn't go away. BG  A few of them did  but   CA  So what do you guys argue about  Sunday     o'clock  you're away from work  what comes up  What's the argument  BG  Because we built this thing together from the beginning  it's this great partnership. I had that with Paul Allen in the early days of Microsoft. I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger  and now Melinda  and in even stronger  equal ways  is the partner  so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to  which groups are working well  She's got a lot of insight. She'll sit down with the employees a lot. We'll take the different trips she described. So there's a lot of collaboration. I can't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or another  CA  How about you  Melinda   though  Can you   Laughter  You never know. MG  Well  here's the thing. We come at things from different angles  and I actually think that's really good. So Bill can look at the big data and say   I want to act based on these global statistics.  For me  I come at it from intuition. I meet with lots of people on the ground and Bill's taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match  and I think what I've taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand  can you actually deliver that vaccine  Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops in her child's mouth  Because the delivery piece is every bit as important as the science. So I think it's been more a coming to over time towards each other's point of view  and quite frankly  the work is better because of it. CA  So  in vaccines and polio and so forth  you've had some amazing successes. What about failure  though  Can you talk about a failure and maybe what you've learned from it  BG  Yeah. Fortunately  we can afford a few failures  because we've certainly had them. We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you're going to have different failures. Like  we put out  one that got a lot of publicity was asking for a better condom. Well  we got hundreds of ideas. Maybe a few of those will work out. We were very na ve  certainly I was  about a drug for a disease in India  visceral leishmaniasis  that I thought  once I got this drug  we can just go wipe out the disease. Well  turns out it took an injection every day for    days. It took three more years to get it than we expected  and then there was no way it was going to get out there. Fortunately  we found out that if you go kill the sand flies  you probably can have success there  but we spent five years  you could say wasted five years  and about    million  on a path that turned out to have very modest benefit when we got there. CA  You're spending  like  a billion dollars a year in education  I think  something like that. Is anything  the story of what's gone right there is quite a long and complex one. Are there any failures that you can talk about  MG  Well  I would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer  and small schools definitely help. They bring down the dropout rate. They have less violence and crime in those schools. But the thing that we learned from that work  and what turned out to be the fundamental key  is a great teacher in front of the classroom. If you don't have an effective teacher in the front of the classroom  I don't care how big or small the building is  you're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be ready for college. CA  So Melinda  this is you and your eldest daughter  Jenn. And just taken about three weeks ago  I think  three or four weeks ago. Where was this  MG  So we went to Tanzania. Jenn's been to Tanzania. All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit  actually. And we did something very different  which is  we decided to go spend two nights and three days with a family. Anna and Sanare are the parents. They invited us to come and stay in their boma. Actually  the goats had been there  I think  living in that particular little hut on their little compound before we got there. And we stayed with their family  and we really  really learned what life is like in rural Tanzania. And the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound  and so let me just give you one explanation of that. They had six children  and as I talked to Anna in the kitchen  we cooked for about five hours in the cooking hut that day  and as I talked to her  she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children. It was a very loving relationship. This was a Maasai warrior and his wife  but they had decided to get married  they clearly had respect and love in the relationship. Their children  their six children  the two in the middle were twins      a boy  and a girl named Grace. And when we'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do  Grace was not a child  she was an adolescent  but she wasn't an adult. She was very  very shy. So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn. We kept trying to engage her  but she was shy. And at night  though  when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania  and there was no moon that night  the first night  and no stars  and Jenn came out of our hut with her REI little headlamp on  Grace went immediately  and got the translator  came straight up to my Jenn and said   When you go home  can I have your headlamp so I can study at night   CA  Oh  wow. MG  And her dad had told me how afraid he was that unlike the son  who had passed his secondary exams  because of her chores  she'd not done so well and wasn't in the government school yet. He said   I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education. I can't pay for private school  and she may end up on this farm like my wife.  So they know the difference that an education can make in a huge  profound way. CA  I mean  this is another pic of your other two kids  Rory and Phoebe  along with Paul Farmer. Bringing up three children when you're the world's richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art. How have you managed it  What's been your approach  BG  Well  I'd say overall the kids get a great education  but you've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they're going to go and do  and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them    most of the money's going to the foundation    and help them find something they're excited about. We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing. And so far  they're fairly diligent  excited to pick their own direction. CA  You've obviously guarded their  privacy carefully for obvious reasons. I'm curious why you've given me permission to show this picture now here at TED. MG  Well  it's interesting. As they get older  they so know that our family belief is about responsibility  that we are in an unbelievable situation just to live in the United States and have a great education  and we have a responsibility to give back to the world. And so as they get older and we are teaching them    they have been to so many countries around the world   they're saying  we do want people to know that we believe in what you're doing  Mom and Dad  and it is okay to show us more. So we have their permission to show this picture  and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it eventually in some of his work. But they really care deeply about the mission of the foundation  too. CA  You've easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all billionaires. Is that your plan for them  BG  Nope. No. They won't have anything like that. They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important. We read an article long  actually  before we got married  where Warren Buffett talked about that  and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor either to society or to the kids. CA  Well  speaking of Warren Buffett  something really amazing happened in       when somehow your only real rival for richest person in America suddenly turned around and agreed to give    percent of his fortune to your foundation. How on Earth did that happen  I guess there's a long version and a short version of that. We've got time for the short version. BG  All right. Well  Warren was a close friend  and he was going to have his wife Suzie give it all away. Tragically  she passed away before he did  and he's big on delegation  and    Laughter    he said   CA  Tweet that. BG  If he's got somebody who is doing something well  and is willing to do it at no charge  maybe that's okay. But we were stunned. MG  Totally stunned. BG  We had never expected it  and it has been unbelievable. It's allowed us to increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically. Half the resources we have come from Warren's mind blowing generosity. CA  And I think you've pledged that by the time you're done  more than  or    percent of your wealth  will be given to the foundation. BG  Yes. CA  And since this relationship  it's amazing  And recently  you and Warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give  what  more than half of their assets for philanthropy. How is that going  BG  Well  we've got about     people who have now taken this giving pledge. The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about  okay  do you hire staff  what do you give to them  We're not trying to homogenize it. I mean  the beauty of philanthropy is this mind blowing diversity. People give to some things. We look and go   Wow.  But that's great. That's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches  including even in one space  like education. We need more experimentation. But it's been wonderful  meeting those people  sharing their journey to philanthropy  how they involve their kids  where they're doing it differently  and it's been way more successful than we expected. Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size in the years ahead. MG  And having people see that other people are making change with philanthropy  I mean  these are people who have created their own businesses  put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas. If they put their ideas and their brain behind philanthropy  they can change the world. And they start to see others doing it  and saying   Wow  I want to do that with my own money.  To me  that's the piece that's incredible. CA  It seems to me  it's actually really hard for some people to figure out even how to remotely spend that much money on something else. There are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people. I'm curious  can you make the pitch  What's the pitch  BG  Well  it's the most fulfilling thing we've ever done  and you can't take it with you  and if it's not good for your kids  let's get together and brainstorm about what we can be done. The world is a far better place because of the philanthropists of the past  and the U.S. tradition here  which is the strongest  is the envy of the world. And part of the reason I'm so optimistic is because I do think philanthropy is going to grow and take some of these things government's not just good at working on and discovering and shine some light in the right direction. CA  The world's got this terrible inequality  growing inequality problem that seems structural. It does seem to me that if more of your peers took the approach that you two have made  it would make a dent both in that problem and certainly in the perception of that problem. Is that a fair comment  BG  Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy  it's good. It tries to balance out  and that's just. MG  But you change systems. In the U.S.  we're trying to change the education system so it's just for everybody and it works for all students. That  to me  really changes the inequality balance. BG  That's the most important. CA  Well  I really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of the trajectory your lives have taken and the spectacular degree to which you have shaped the future. Thank you so much for coming to TED and for sharing with us and for all you do. BG  Thank you. MG  Thank you. BG  Thank you. MG  Thank you very much. BG  All right  good job.  Applause  If you remember that first decade of the web  it was really a static place. You could go online  you could look at pages  and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really tech savvy for the time. And with the rise of social media and social networks in the early     s  the web was completely changed to a place where now the vast majority of content we interact with is put up by average users  either in YouTube videos or blog posts or product reviews or social media postings. And it's also become a much more interactive place  where people are interacting with others  they're commenting  they're sharing  they're not just reading. So Facebook is not the only place you can do this  but it's the biggest  and it serves to illustrate the numbers. Facebook has  .  billion users per month. So half the Earth's Internet population is using Facebook. They are a site  along with others  that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill  and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online. So the result is that we have behavioral  preference  demographic data for hundreds of millions of people  which is unprecedented in history. And as a computer scientist   what this means is that I've been able to build models that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes for all of you that you don't even know you're sharing information about. As scientists  we use that to help the way people interact online  but there's less altruistic applications  and there's a problem in that users don't really understand these techniques and how they work  and even if they did  they don't have a lot of control over it. So what I want to talk to you about today is some of these things that we're able to do  and then give us some ideas of how we might go forward to move some control back into the hands of users. So this is Target  the company. I didn't just put that logo on this poor  pregnant woman's belly. You may have seen this anecdote that was printed in Forbes magazine where Target sent a flyer to this    year old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant. Yeah  the dad was really upset. He said   How did Target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents   It turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they  call a pregnancy score  which is not just whether or  not a woman's pregnant  but what her due date is. And they compute that not by looking at the obvious things  like  she's buying a crib or baby clothes  but things like  she bought more vitamins than she normally had  or she bought a handbag that's big enough to hold diapers. And by themselves  those purchases don't seem like they might reveal a lot  but it's a pattern of behavior that  when you take it in the context  of thousands of other people  starts to actually reveal some insights. So that's the kind of thing that we do when we're predicting stuff about you on social media. We're looking for little patterns of behavior that  when you detect them among millions of people  lets us find out all kinds of things. So in my lab and with colleagues  we've developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your political preference  your personality score  gender  sexual orientation  religion  age  intelligence  along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are. We can do all of this really well. And again  it doesn't come from what you might think of as obvious information. So my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academies. If you Google this  you'll find it. It's four pages  easy to read. And they looked at just people's Facebook likes  so just the things you like on Facebook  and used that to predict all these attributes  along with some other ones. And in their paper they listed the five likes that were most indicative of high intelligence. And among those was liking a page for curly fries.  Laughter  Curly fries are delicious  but liking them does not necessarily mean that you're smarter than the average person. So how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that's being predicted  And it turns out that we have to look at a whole bunch of underlying theories to see why we're able to do this. One of them is a sociological theory called homophily  which basically says people are friends with people like them. So if you're smart  you tend to be friends with smart people  and if you're young  you tend to be friends with young people  and this is well established for hundreds of years. We also know a lot about how information spreads through networks. It turns out things like viral videos or Facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through social networks. So this is something we've studied for a long time. We have good models of it. And so you can put those things together and start seeing why things like this happen. So if I were to give you a hypothesis  it would be that a smart guy started this page  or maybe one of the first people who liked it would have scored high on that test. And they liked it  and their friends saw it  and by homophily  we know that he probably had smart friends  and so it spread to them   and some of them liked it  and they had smart friends  and so it spread to them  and so it propagated through the network to a host of smart people  so that by the end  the action of liking the curly fries page is indicative of high intelligence  not because of the content  but because the actual action of liking reflects back the common attributes of other people who have done it. So this is pretty complicated stuff  right  It's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user  and even if you do  what can the average user do about it  How do you know that  you've liked something that indicates a trait for you that's totally irrelevant to the content of what you've liked  There's a lot of power that users don't have to control how this data is used. And I see that as a real  problem going forward. So I think there's a couple paths that we want to look at if we want to give users some control over how this data is used  because it's not always going to be used for their benefit. An example I often give is that  if I ever get bored being a professor  I'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you're a drug user  if you're an alcoholic. We know how to predict all that. And I'm going to sell reports to H.R. companies and big businesses that want to hire you. We totally can do that now. I could start that business tomorrow  and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that. That seems to me to be a problem. So one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path. And in some respects  I think that that would be most effective  but the problem is we'd actually have to do it. Observing our political process in action makes me think it's highly unlikely that we're going to get a bunch of representatives to sit down  learn about this  and then enact sweeping changes to intellectual property law in the U.S. so users control their data. We could go the policy route  where social media companies say  you know what  You own your data. You have total control over how it's used. The problem is that the revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting  users' data in some way. It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users aren't the customer  they're the product. And so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users  It's possible  but I don't think it's something that we're going to see change quickly. So I think the other path that we can go down that's going to be more effective is one of more science. It's doing science that allowed us to develop all these mechanisms for computing this personal data in the first place. And it's actually very similar research that we'd have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user   Here's the risk of that action you just took.  By liking that Facebook page  or by sharing this piece of personal information  you've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace. And that  I think  can affect whether or not people want to share something  keep it private  or just keep it offline altogether. We can also look at things like allowing people to encrypt data that they upload  so it's kind of invisible and worthless to sites like Facebook or third party services that access it  but that select users who the person who posted it want to see it have access to see it. This is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective  and so scientists are going to be willing to do it. So that gives us an advantage over the law side. One of the problems that people bring up when I talk about this is  they say  you know  if people start keeping all this data private  all those methods that you've been developing to predict their traits are going to fail. And I say  absolutely  and for me  that's success  because as a scientist  my goal is not to infer information about users  it's to improve the way people interact online. And sometimes that involves inferring things about them  but if users don't want me to use that data  I think they should have the right to do that. I want users to be informed and consenting users of the tools that we develop. And so I think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward  as these tools evolve and advance  means that we're going to have an educated and empowered user base  and I think all of us can agree that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward. Thank you. So a chip  a poet and a boy. It's just about    years ago  June       when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip. Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions    I don't know what that means  but  it's what it says on Wikipedia   there was a flaw and an error that meant that there was a certain probability that the result of the calculation would be an error  and the probability was one out of every     billion calculations. So Intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every        years. They didn't think it was significant  but there was an outrage in the community. The community  the techies  said  this flaw has to be addressed. They were not going to stand by quietly as Intel gave them these chips. So there was a revolution across the world. People marched to demand    okay  not really exactly like that   but they rose up and they demanded that Intel fix the flaw. And Intel set aside     million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw. So billions of dollars in our society was spent to address a problem which would come once out of every     billion calculations. Number two  a poet. This is Martin Niem ller. You're familiar with his poetry. Around the height of the Nazi period  he started repeating the verse   First they came for the communists  and I did nothing  did not speak out because I was not a communist. Then they came for the socialists. Then they came for the trade unions. Then they came for the Jews. And then they came for me. But there was no one left to speak for me.  Now  Niem ller is offering a certain kind of insight. This is an insight at the core of intelligence. We could call it cluefulness. It's a certain kind of test  Can you recognize an underlying threat and respond  Can you save yourself or save your kind  Turns out ants are pretty good at this. Cows  not so much. So can you see the pattern  Can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it  Number two. Number three  a boy. This is my friend Aaron Swartz. He's Tim's friend. He's friends of many of you in this audience  and seven years ago  Aaron came to me with a question. It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk. I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk   Laws that choke creativity.  And Aaron looked at me and was a little impatient  and he said   So how are you ever going to solve the problems you're talking about  Copyright policy  Internet policy  how are you ever going to address those problems so long as there's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works   So I was a little put off by this. He wasn't sharing in my celebration. And I said to him   You know  Aaron  it's not my field  not my field.  He said   You mean as an academic  it's not your field   I said   Yeah  as an academic  it's not my field.  He said   What about as a citizen  As a citizen.  Now  this is the way Aaron was. He didn't tell. He asked questions. But his questions spoke as clearly as my four year old's hug. He was saying to me   You've got to get a clue. You have got to get a clue  because there is a flaw at the core of the operating system of this democracy  and it's not a flaw every one out of     billion times our democracy tries to make a decision. It is every time  every single important issue. We've got to end the bovinity of this political society. We've got to adopt  it turns out  the word is fourmi formatic attitude    that's what the Internet tells me the word is    the ant's appreciative attitude that gets us to recognize this flaw  save our kind and save our demos. Now if you know Aaron Swartz  you know that we lost him just over a year ago. It was about six weeks before I gave my TED Talk  and I was so grateful to Chris that he asked me to give this TED Talk  not because I had the chance to talk to you  although that was great  but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression. I couldn't begin to describe the sadness. Because I had to focus. I had to focus on  what was I going to say to you  It saved me. But after the buzz  the excitement  the power that comes from this community  I began to yearn for a less sterile  less academic way to address these issues  the issues that I was talking about. We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire as a target for this political movement  because the primary in New Hampshire is so incredibly important. It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion that was beginning to talk about  how would we make this issue of this corruption central in       But it was another soul that caught my imagination  a woman named Doris Haddock  aka Granny D. On January             years ago  at the age of     Granny D started a walk. She started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington  D.C. with a single sign on her chest that said   campaign finance reform.  Eighteen months later  at the age of     she arrived in Washington with hundreds following her  including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her. Now  I don't have    months to walk across the country. I've got three kids who hate to walk  and a wife who  it turns out  still hates when I'm not there for mysterious reasons  so this was not an option  but the question I asked  could we remix Granny D a bit  What about a walk not of       miles but of     miles across New Hampshire in January  So on January     the anniversary of Aaron's death  we began a walk that ended on January   th  the day that Granny D was born. A total of     people joined us across this walk  as we went from the very top to the very bottom of New Hampshire talking about this issue. And what was astonishing to me  something I completely did not expect to find  was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue. We had found in a poll that    percent of Americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics. Now politicians and pundits tell you  there's nothing we can do about this issue  Americans don't care about it  but the reason for that is that    percent of Americans think there's nothing that can be done about this issue. And it's this gap between    and    that explains our politics of resignation. I mean  after all  at least    percent of us wish we could fly like Superman  but because at least    percent of us believe we can't  we don't leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge. That's because we accept our limits  and so too with this reform. But when you give people the sense of hope  you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility. As Harvey Milk said  if you give 'em hope  you give 'em a chance  a way to think about how this change is possible. Hope. And hope is the one thing that we  Aaron's friends  failed him with  because we let him lose that sense of hope. I loved that boy like I love my son. But we failed him. And I love my country  and I'm not going to fail that. I'm not going to fail that. That sense of hope  we're going to hold  and we're going to fight for  however impossible this battle looks. What's next  Well  we started with this march with     people  and next year  there will be       on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause  and then in       before the primary  there will be        who march across that state  meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause. And as we have marched  people around the country have begun to say   Can we do the same thing in our state   So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers  that is  Granny D walkers  and Granny D walkers across the country will be marching for this reform. Number one. Number two  on this march  one of the founders of Thunderclap  David Cascino  was with us  and he said   Well what can we do   And so they developed a platform  which we are announcing today  that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform. Regardless of where you are  in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire  you can sign up and directly be informed where the candidates are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is going to make this possibility real. And then finally number three  the hardest. We're in the age of the Super PAC. Indeed yesterday  Merriam announced that Merriam Webster will have Super PAC as a word. It is now an official word in the dictionary. So on May    aka May Day  we're going to try an experiment. We're going to try a launching of what we can think of as a Super PAC to end all Super PACs. And the basic way this works is this. For the last year  we have been working with analysts and political experts to calculate  how much would it cost to win enough votes in the United States Congress to make fundamental reform possible  What is that number  Half a billion  A billion  What is that number  And then whatever that number is  we are going to kickstart  sort of  because you can't use KickStarter for political work  but anyway  kickstart  sort of  first a bottom up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals  and when those goals have been reached  we will turn to the large dollar contributors  to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary to win this issue  to change the way money influences politics  so that on November    which I discovered yesterday is the day that Aaron would have been    years old  on November    we will celebrate     representatives in the House and    Senators in the United States Senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform. So last night  we heard about wishes. Here's my wish. May one. May the ideals of one boy unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people  we are the people who were promised a government  a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone  the people  who  as Madison told us  meant not the rich more than the poor. May one. And then may you  may you join this movement  not because you're a politician  not because you're an expert  not because this is your field  but because if you are  you are a citizen. Aaron asked me that. Now I've asked you. Thank you very much. When people think about cities  they tend to think of certain things. They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers  noisy cabs. But when I think about cities  I think about people. Cities are fundamentally about people  and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work. So even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them. And today  some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces. So I believe that lively  enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city. They are what makes it come alive. But what makes a public space work  What attracts people to successful public spaces  and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away  I thought  if I could answer those questions  I could make a huge contribution to my city. But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist  and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces. One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan. This little space became a small phenomenon  and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers  it made an enormous impression on me. I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather  so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident. I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail. But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it  Well  I would sit in the park and watch very carefully  and first among other things were the comfortable  movable chairs. People would come in  find their own seat  move it a bit  actually  and then stay a while  and then interestingly  people themselves attracted other people  and ironically  I felt more peaceful if there were other people around. And it was green. This little park provided what New Yorkers crave  comfort and greenery. But my question was  why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone  or like a trespasser  Unfortunately  that's not how cities were being designed. So here you see a familiar sight. This is how plazas have been designed for generations. They have that stylish  Spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture  but it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this. They not only look desolate  they feel downright dangerous. I mean  where would you sit here  What would you do here  But architects love them. They are plinths for their creations. They might tolerate a sculpture or two  but that's about it. And for developers  they are ideal. There's nothing to water  nothing to maintain  and no undesirable people to worry about. But don't you think this is a waste  For me  becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that I lived in and loved. I wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in Paley Park  and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this. But over the many years  I have learned how hard it is to create successful  meaningful  enjoyable public spaces. As I learned from my stepfather  they certainly do not happen by accident  especially in a city like New York  where public space has to be fought for to begin with  and then for them to be successful  somebody has to think very hard about every detail. Now  open spaces in cities are opportunities. Yes  they are opportunities for commercial investment  but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city  and those two goals are often not aligned with one another  and therein lies the conflict. The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early     s  when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River. And this sandy wasteland had lain barren for    years  and we were told  unless we found a developer in six months  it would go bankrupt. So we came up with a radical  almost insane idea. Instead of building a park as a complement to future development  why don't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high quality public open space first  and see if that made a difference. So we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade  so whatever we built had to be perfect. So just to make sure  I insisted that we build a mock up in wood  at scale  of the railing and the sea wall. And when I sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me  the railing hit exactly at eye level  blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge. So you see  details really do make a difference. But design is not just how something looks  it's how your body feels on that seat in that space  and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience. In this photo  everything looks very finished  but that granite edge  those lights  the back on that bench  the trees in planting  and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be. Now  this proved very valuable    years later when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of New York. And he said to me on that very day  he said that New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people. And he asked me   So where are you going to put one million additional New Yorkers   Well  I didn't have any idea. Now  you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants  so we were excited about the prospect of growth  but honestly  where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water  How were we going to find housing for that many new New Yorkers  And if we couldn't spread out  which was probably a good thing  where could new housing go  And what about cars  Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars. So what were we going to do  If we couldn't spread out  we had to go up. And if we had to go up  we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car. So that meant using one of our greatest assets  our transit system. But we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it. So here was the answer to our puzzle. If we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit  we could actually handle that population increase  we thought. And so here was the plan  what we really needed to do  We needed to redo our zoning    and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool    and basically reshape the entire city  targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our car oriented  suburban style neighborhoods. Well  this was an unbelievably ambitious idea  ambitious because communities had to approve those plans. So how was I going to get this done  By listening. So I began listening  in fact  thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust. You know  communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods. It's not something you can just fake. And so I began walking. I can't tell you how many blocks I walked  in sweltering summers  in freezing winters  year after year  just so I could get to understand the DNA of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like. I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert  finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns. So little by little  neighborhood by neighborhood  block by block  we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit. Over the course of    years  we were able to rezone     neighborhoods     percent of the city         blocks  so that now     percent of all new development of New York is within a    minute walk of a subway. In other words  nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car. Well  those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important  but rezoning was never my mission. You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning. My mission was always to create great public spaces. So in the areas where we zoned for significant development  I was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's lives. Here you see what was two miles of abandoned  degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn  impossible to get to and impossible to use. Now the zoning here was massive  so I felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts  and I spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans. I wanted to make sure that there were tree lined paths from the upland to the water  that there were trees and plantings everywhere  and  of course  lots and lots of places to sit. Honestly  I had no idea how it would turn out. I had to have faith. But I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans. And then it opened  and I have to tell you  it was incredible. People came from all over the city to be in these parks. I know they changed the lives of the people who live there  but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image of their city. I often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs  and I can't tell you why  but I'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there. And here is a new park in lower Manhattan. Now  the water's edge in lower Manhattan was a complete mess before     . Wall Street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge. And after       the city had very little control. But I thought if we went to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan. And it did. Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides. I really love this park. You know  railings have to be higher now  so we put bar seating at the edge  and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it. And see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop. And I love when people come there and look up and they say   Wow  there's Brooklyn  and it's so close.  So what's the trick  How do you turn a park into a place that people want to be  Well  it's up to you  not as a city planner but as a human being. You don't tap into your design expertise. You tap into your humanity. I mean  would you want to go there  Would you want to stay there  Can you see into it and out of it  Are there other people there  Does it seem green and friendly  Can you find your very own seat  Well now  all over New York City  there are places where you can find your very own seat. Where there used to be parking spaces  there are now pop up cafes. Where Broadway traffic used to run  there are now tables and chairs. Where    years ago  sidewalk cafes were not allowed  they are now everywhere. But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple  and it's even harder to keep them that way. So now I'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the High Line. The High Line was an elevated railway. The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side  and when the train stopped running  it became a self seeded landscape  a kind of a garden in the sky. And when I saw it the first time  honestly  when I went up on that old viaduct  I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person  honestly. And when I was appointed  saving the first two sections of the High Line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project. I knew if there was a day that I didn't worry about the High Line  it would come down. And the High Line  even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular  it is the most contested public space in the city. You might see a beautiful park  but not everyone does. You know  it's true  commercial interests will always battle against public space. You might say   How wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the High Line.  Well  a developer sees just one thing  customers. Hey  why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the High Line  Wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city  Well no  it would not be terrific. It would be a mall  and not a park. And you know what  it might mean more money for the city  but a city has to take the long view  the view for the common good. Most recently  the last section of the High Line  the third section of the High Line  the final section of the High Line  has been pitted against development interests  where some of the city's leading developers are building more than    million square feet at the Hudson Yards. And they came to me and proposed that they  temporarily disassemble  that third and final section. Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill. Perhaps it was just in their way. But in any case  it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition  and that was only two years ago. So you see  no matter how popular and successful a public space may be  it can never be taken for granted. Public spaces always    this is it saved    public spaces always need vigilant champions  not only to claim them at the outset for public use  but to design them for the people that use them  then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone  that they are not violated  invaded  abandoned or ignored. If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner  it is that public spaces have power. It's not just the number of people using them  it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there. Public space can change how you live in a city  how you feel about a city  whether you choose one city over another  and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city. I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party. People stay because they are having a great time. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Right now there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a    page paper based on some age old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to herself what this task that she's engaging in has to do with what she wants to do with her life  which is be an educator  change lives  and spark magic. Right now there is an aspiring teacher in a graduate school of education who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement in the most disengaging way possible. Right now there's a first year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards  who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately  while at the same time saying to herself over and over again   Don't smile till November   because that's what she was taught in her teacher education program. Right now there's a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he's very  very sick and can't make it to school tomorrow. On the other hand  right now there are amazing educators that are sharing information  information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge. Right now there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention  a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before  but if they close their eyes tightly enough  they can envision that world because the storytelling is so compelling. Right now there's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says   Put them down.  Right now. So people will then say   Well  Chris  you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you're also describing these powerful educators. If you're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular  these guys will probably cancel each other out  and then we'll be okay.  The reality is  the folks I described as the master teachers  the master narrative builders  the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms. The folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don't even know what teacher certification means. They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education. And that to me is sad. It's sad because the people who I described  they were very disinterested in the learning process  want to be effective teachers  but they have no models. I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain. Mark Twain says that proper preparation  or teaching  is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good  it can turn awful practices into powerful ones  it can change men and transform them into angels. The folks who I described earlier got proper preparation in teaching  not in any college or university  but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage. Guess where those places are  Barber shops  rap concerts  and most importantly  in the black church. And I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy. Who here has been to a black church  We got a couple of hands. You go to a black church  their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience  so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes  and then he takes a pause  and he says   Oh my gosh  they're not quite paying attention.  So he says   Can I get an amen   Audience  Amen. Chris Emdin  So I can I get an amen  Audience  Amen. CE  And all of a sudden  everybody's reawoken. That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention. He drops his voice at a very  very low volume when he wants people to key into him  and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers. So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills  that magic that you need to engage an audience  to engage a student  So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education  that we could focus on content  and that's fine  and we could focus on theories  and that's fine  but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing. Now people oftentimes say   Well  magic is just magic.  There are teachers who  despite all their challenges  who have those skills  get into those schools and are  able to engage an audience  and the administrator walks by and says   Wow  he's so good  I wish all my teachers could be that good.  And when they try to describe what that is  they just say   He has that magic.  But I'm here to tell you that magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Magic can be taught. Now  how do you teach it  You teach it by allowing people to go into those spaces where the magic is happening. If you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education  you've got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood. You've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop  you've got to attend that black church  and you've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do. At our teacher education classes at my university  I've started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts. They watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands. They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage. They listen to his metaphors and analogies  and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic. They learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch  you don't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more. And if we could transform teacher education to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic then poof  we could make dead classes come alive  we could reignite imaginations  and we can change education. Thank you. What is the intersection between technology  art and science  Curiosity and wonder  because it drives us to explore  because we're surrounded by things we can't see. And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space  to make the invisible visible  because what that does  it expands our horizons  it transforms our perception  it opens our minds and it touches our heart. So here are some scenes from my  D IMAX film   Mysteries of the Unseen World.  There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect  and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life. We can see how organisms emerge and grow  how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight. And at the grand scale  time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion. We can view not only the vast sweep of nature  but the restless movement of humanity. Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane  and by turning air traffic data into time lapse imagery  we can see something that's above us constantly but invisible  the vast network of air travel over the United States. We can do the same thing with ships at sea. We can turn data into a time lapse view of a global economy in motion. And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere  pulsing with lightning  crowned by the aurora Borealis. It may be the ultimate time lapse image  the anatomy of Earth brought to life. At the other extreme  there are things that move too fast for our eyes  but we have technology that can look into that world as well. With high speed cameras  we can do the opposite of time lapse. We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision. And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work  and perhaps we can even imitate them. When a dragonfly flutters by  you may not realize  but it's the greatest flier in nature. It can hover  fly backwards  even upside down. And by tracking markers on an insect's wings  we can visualize the air flow that they produce. Nobody knew the secret  but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time. And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places. We're giants  and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see. The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times. This is the egg of a butterfly. And there are unseen creatures living all over your body  including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes  crawling over your skin at night. Can you guess what this is  Shark skin. A caterpillar's mouth. The eye of a fruit fly. An eggshell. A flea. A snail's tongue. We think we know most of the animal kingdom  but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered. A spider also has great secrets  because spiders' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic. This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world. The silk is     times thinner than human hair. On there is bacteria  and near that bacteria     times smaller  a virus. Inside of that     times smaller  three strands of DNA. And nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes  single carbon atoms. With the tip of a powerful microscope  we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices. Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way. Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day  perhaps  repair DNA. We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances  born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life. So under an endless rain of cosmic dust  the air is full of pollen  micro diamonds and jewels from other planets and supernova explosions. People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable. Knowing that there's so much around us we can't see forever changes our understanding of the world  and by looking at unseen worlds  we recognize that we exist in the living universe  and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards. Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives. We'll just have to see. Thank you. I was born and raised in Sierra Leone  a small and very beautiful country in West Africa  a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent. However  Sierra Leone is infamous for a decade long rebel war in the '  s when entire villages were burnt down. An estimated       men  women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time. As my family and I ran for safety when I was about    from one of those attacks  I resolved that I would do everything I could to ensure that my own children would not go through the  same experiences we had. They would  in fact  be part of a Sierra Leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power. As I watched people who I knew  loved ones  recover from this devastation  one thing that deeply troubled me was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses. The reason  I would come to find out  was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well. The prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb  and which connects to the prosthetic ankle. Even in the developed world  it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket  if ever. Prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create single material prosthetic sockets. Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient  leaving them with pressure sores and blisters. It does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is. If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable  you will not use your leg  and that is just simply unacceptable in our age. So one day  when I met professor Hugh Herr about two and a half years ago  and he asked me if I knew  how to solve this problem  I said   No  not yet  but I would love to figure it out.  And so  for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab  I designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses. I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy  then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces  and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture. We use a  D printer to create a multi material prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient. In short  we're using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply. In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab  one of our patients  a U.S. veteran who has been an amputee for about    years and worn dozens of legs  said of one of our printed parts   It's so soft  it's like walking on pillows  and it's effing sexy.  Disability in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives. My hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them. For me  a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies. Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston  I hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential. Thank you very much. Pat Mitchell  That day  January          began like all others. You were both doing the work that you love. You were meeting with constituents  which is something that you loved doing as a congresswoman  and Mark  you were happily preparing for your next space shuttle. And suddenly  everything  that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever. Mark Kelly  Yeah  it's amazing  it's amazing how  everything can change for any of us in an instant. People don't realize that. I certainly didn't. Gabby Giffords  Yes. MK  And on that Saturday morning  I got this horrible phone call from Gabby's chief of staff. She didn't have much other information. She just said   Gabby was shot.  A few minutes later  I called her back and I actually thought for a second  well  maybe I just imagined  getting this phone call. I called her back  and  that's when she told me that Gabby had been shot in the head. And from that point on  I knew that our lives were  going to be a lot different. PM  And when you arrived at the hospital  what was the prognosis that they gave you about Gabby's condition  and what recovery  if any  you could expect  MK  Well  for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury  they typically can't tell you much. Every injury is different. It's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable  which is another TBI kind of injury. So they didn't know how long Gabby would be in a coma  didn't know when that would change and what the prognosis would be. PM  Gabby  has your recovery been an effort to create  a new Gabby Giffords or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords  GG  The new one    better  stronger  tougher. MK  That to say  when you look at the picture behind us  to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong  and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do. I don't know anybody that's as tough as my  wonderful wife right here. PM  And what were the first signs that recovery was not  only going to be possible but you were going to have some semblance of the life that you and Gabby had planned  MK  Well  the first thing  for me  was Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious  but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a restaurant  in that she pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next  and at that point I knew that she was still in there. PM  And there were certain words  too. Didn't she surprise you with  words in the beginning  MK  Well  it was tough in the beginning. GG  What  What  Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. MK  Yeah  that was it. For the first month  that was the extent of Gabby's vocabulary. For some reason  she has aphasia  which is difficulty with communication. She latched on to the word  chicken   which isn't the best but  certainly is not the worst. And we were actually worried it could have been a lot worse than that. PM  Gabby  what's been  the toughest challenge for you during this recovery  GG  Talking. Really hard. Really. MK  Yeah  with aphasia  Gabby knows what she wants to say  she just can't get it out. She understands everything  but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture  the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head  which is where the bullet passed through. PM  So you have to do  a very dangerous thing  speak for your wife. MK  I do. It might be some of the most dangerous things I've ever done. PM  Gabby  are you optimistic about your continuing recovery    walking  talking  being able to move your arm and leg  GG  I'm optimistic. It will be a long  hard haul  but I'm optimistic. PM  That seems to be the number one  characteristic of Gabby Giffords  wouldn't you say   Applause  MK  Gabby's always been really optimistic. She works incredibly hard every day. GG  On the treadmill   walked on my treadmill  Spanish lessons  French horn. MK  It's only my wife who could be    and if you knew her before she was injured  you would kind of understand this    somebody who could be injured and have such a hard time communicating and meets with a speech therapist  and then about a month ago  she says   I want to learn Spanish again.  PM  Well  let's take a little closer look at the wife  and this was even before you met Gabby Giffords. And she's on a motor scooter there  but it's my understanding that's a very tame image of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up. MK  Yeah  Gabby  she  used to race motorcycles. So that's a scooter  but she had    well  she still has a BMW motorcycle. PM  Does she ride it  MK  Well  that's a challenge with not being able to move her right arm  but I think with something I know about  Velcro  we might be able to get her back on the bike  Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar. PM  I have a feeling we might  see that picture next  Gabby. But you meet  you're already decided that you're going to dedicate  your life to service. You're going into the military and eventually to become an astronaut. So you meet. What attracts you to Gabby  MK  Well  when we met  oddly enough  it was the last time we were in Vancouver  about    years ago. We met in Vancouver  at the airport  on a trip  that we were both taking to China  that I would actually  from my background  I would call it a boondoggle. Gabby would   GG  Fact finding mission. MK  She would call it an important fact finding mission. She was a state senator at the time  and we met here  at the airport  before a trip to China. PM  Would you describe it  as a whirlwind romance  GG  No  no  no. A good friend. MK  Yeah  we were friends for a long time. GG  Yes.  Laughter  MK  And then she invited me on  about a year or so later  she invited me on a date. Where'd we go  Gabby  GG  Death row. MK  Yes. Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona  which was just outside  Gabby's state senate district. They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment  in the state of Arizona. So she couldn't get anybody  else to go with her  and I'm like   Of course I  want to go to death row.  So that was our first date. We've been together ever since. GG  Yes. PM  Well  that might have contributed to the reason that Gabby decided to marry you. You were willing to go to death row  after all. MK  I guess. PM  Gabby  what did make you want to marry Mark  GG  Um  good friends. Best friends. Best friends. MK  I thought we always had a very special relationship. We've gone through some tough times and it's only made it stronger. GG  Stronger. PM  After you got married  however  you continued very independent lives. Actually  you didn't even live together. MK  We had one of those commuter marriages. In our case  it was Washington  D.C.  Houston  Tucson. Sometimes we'd go clockwise  sometimes counterclockwise  to all those different places  and we didn't really live together until that Saturday morning. Within an hour of Gabby being shot  I was on an airplane to Tucson  and that was the moment where that had changed things. PM  And also  Gabby  you had run for Congress after being a state senator and served in Congress for six years. What did you like best about being in Congress  GG  Fast pace. Fast pace. PM  Well it was the way you did it. GG  Yes  yes. Fast pace. PM  I'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way. MK  Yeah  you know  legislation is often at a colossally slow pace  but my wife  and I have to admit  a lot of other members of Congress that I know  work incredibly hard. I mean  Gabby would run  around like a crazy person  never take a day off  maybe a half a day off a month  and whenever she was awake she was working  and she really  really thrived on that  and still does today. GG  Yes. Yes. PM  Installing solar panels on the top of her house  I have to say. So after the tragic incident  Mark  you decided to resign your position as an astronaut  even though you were supposed to take the next space mission. Everybody  including Gabby  talked you into going back  and you did end up taking. MK  Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured  I called my boss  the chief astronaut  Dr. Peggy Whitson  and I said   Peggy  I know I'm launching in space in three months from now. Gabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson. You've got to find a replacement for me.  So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut  but I gave up my job and they found a replacement. Months later  maybe about two months later  I started about getting my job back  which is something  when you become this primary caregiver person  which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position  it's a challenging role but at some point you've got to figure out when you're going to get your life back  and at the time  I couldn't ask Gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again. But I knew she was  GG  Yes. Yes. Yes. MK  She was the biggest  supporter of my career  and I knew it was the right thing to do. PM  And yet I'm trying to imagine  Mark  what that was like  going off onto a mission  one presumes safely   but it's never a guarantee  and knowing that Gabby is   MK  Well not only was  she still in the hospital  on the third day of that flight  literally while I was rendezvousing with the space station  and you've got two vehicles moving at        miles an hour  I'm actually flying it  looking out the window  a bunch of computers  Gabby was in brain surgery  literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic  yeah  which is the whole side of her head. Now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in Tucson for the first time  Gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of Tupperware that has the real skull.  Laughter  GG  The real skull. MK  Which freaks people out  sometimes. PM  Is that for appetizer or dessert  Mark  MK  Well  it just gets the conversation going. PM  But there was a lot  of conversation about something you did  Gabby  after Mark's flight. You had to make another  step of courage too  because here was  Congress deadlocked again  and you got out of the rehabilitation center  got yourself to Washington so that you could walk  on the floor of the House    I can barely talk about this without getting emotional   and cast a vote which could have been the deciding vote. GG  The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling. MK  Yeah  we had that vote  I guess about five months after Gabby was injured  and she made this bold decision to go back. A very controversial vote  but she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time. PM  And after that  resigned and began what has been a very slow and challenging recovery. What's life like  day to day  MK  Well  that's Gabby's service dog Nelson. GG  Nelson. MK  New member of our family. GG  Yes  yes. MK  And we got him from a  GG  Prison. Murder. MK  We have a lot of connections with prisons  apparently.  Laughter  Nelson came from a prison  raised by a murderer in Massachusetts. But she did a great job with this dog. He's a fabulous service dog. PM  So Gabby  what have you learned from your experiences the past few years  MK  Yeah  what have you learned  GG  Deeper. Deeper. PM  Your relationship is deeper. It has to be. You're together all the time now. MK  I imagine being grateful  too  right  GG  Grateful. PM  This is a picture of  family and friends gathering  but I love these pictures because they show the Gabby and Mark relationship now. And you describe it  Gabby  over and over  as deeper on so many levels. Yes  MK  I think when something tragic happens in a family  it can pull people together. Here's us watching the space shuttle fly over Tucson  the Space Shuttle Endeavour  the one that I was the  commander on its last flight  on its final flight on top of an airplane on a     on its way to L.A.  NASA was kind enough  to have it fly over Tucson. PM  And of course  the two of you go through these challenges of a slow and difficult recovery  and yet  Gabby  how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook  GG  I want to make the world a better place. PM  And you're doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you. You are people who have done service to your country and you  are continuing to do that with a new initiative  a new purpose. And Gabby  what's on the agenda now  GG  Americans for Responsible Solutions. MK  That's our political action committee  where we are trying to  get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country  and to try to pass some reasonable legislation. GG  Yes. Yes.  Applause  MK  You know  this affected  us very personally  but it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved. It was really the    murdered first graders and kindergartners in Newtown  Connecticut  and the response that we saw afterwards where    well  look what's happened so far. So far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing. We're trying to change that. PM  There have been    mass shootings since Newtown  a school a week in the first  two months of last year. What are you doing that's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities  MK  We're gun owners   we support gun rights. At the same time  we've  got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. It's not too difficult to do that. This issue  like many others  has become very polarizing and political  and we're trying to bring some balance to the debate in Washington. PM  Thank you both for that effort. And not surprisingly for  this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure  you just keep challenging yourself  and the sky seems to be the limit. I have to share this video of your most recent adventure. Take a look at Gabby. MK  This is a couple months ago. Good stuff. Gorgeous. Oh  thank you. Mountains. Gorgeous mountains. MK  Let me just say one of the guys that Gabby jumped with that day was a Navy SEAL who she met in Afghanistan who was injured in combat  had a really rough time. Gabby visited him when he was at Bethesda and went through a really tough period. He started doing better. Months later  Gabby was shot in the head  and then he supported her while she was in the hospital in Houston. So they have a very  very nice connection. GG  Yes. PM  What a wonderful moment. Because this is the TED stage  Gabby  I know you worked very hard to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience. GG  Thank you. Hello  everyone. Thank you for inviting us here today. It's been a long  hard haul  but I'm getting better. I'm working hard  lots of therapy    speech therapy  physical therapy  and yoga too. But my spirit is strong as ever. I'm still fighting to make  the world a better place  and you can too. Get involved with your community. Be a leader. Set an example. Be passionate. Be courageous. Be your best. Thank you very much. MK  Thank you. GG  Thank you. MK  Thank you everybody. GG  Bye bye.  Applause  So I've been thinking about the difference between the r sum  virtues and  the eulogy virtues. The r sum  virtues are the ones you put on your r sum   which are the skills  you bring to the marketplace. The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy  which are deeper  who are you   in your depth  what is the nature of your relationships  are you bold  loving  dependable  consistency  And most of us  including  me  would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. But at least in my case   are they the ones that I think about the most   And the answer is no. So I've been thinking about that problem  and a thinker who has  helped me think about it is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik  who was a rabbi who wrote a book called  The Lonely Man Of Faith  in     . Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures  which he called Adam I and Adam II. Adam I is the worldly  ambitious  external side of our nature. He wants to build  create  create companies  create innovation. Adam II is the humble side of our nature. Adam II wants not only  to do good but to be good  to live in a way internally that honors God  creation and our possibilities. Adam I wants to conquer the world. Adam II wants to hear  a calling and obey the world. Adam I savors accomplishment. Adam II savors inner  consistency and strength. Adam I asks how things work. Adam II asks why we're here. Adam I's motto is  success.  Adam II's motto is  love  redemption and return.  And Soloveitchik argued  that these two sides of our nature are  at war with each other. We live in perpetual self confrontation between the external success and the internal value. And the tricky thing   I'd say  about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics. The external logic is  an economic logic  input leads to output   risk leads to reward. The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and  often an inverse logic. You have to give to receive. You have to surrender  to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself. You have to conquer the desire to get what you want. In order to fulfill yourself  you have to forget yourself. In order to find yourself   you have to lose yourself. We happen to live in a society  that favors Adam I  and often neglects Adam II. And the problem is  that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game  and you become a cold   calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there's a difference between your desired  self and your actual self. You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want  you hope someone will give to you. You don't have the  depth of conviction. You don't have an emotional sonorousness. You don't have  commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit. I was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid Adam II  how you build a depth of character. Through history  people  have gone back into their own pasts  sometimes to a precious  time in their life  to their childhood  and often  the mind  gravitates in the past to a moment of shame  some sin committed   some act of selfishness  an act of omission  of shallowness  the sin of anger  the sin of self pity  trying to be a people pleaser   a lack of courage. Adam I is built by  building on your strengths. Adam II is built by fighting  your weaknesses. You go into yourself   you find the sin which you've committed over and again through your life  your signature sin out of which the others emerge  and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin  and out of that wrestling   that suffering  then a depth of character is constructed. And we're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves  in that we're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it  how to confront it   and how to combat it. We live in a culture  with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate  about Adam II. Finally  Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation  the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life  this way   Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime  therefore we must  be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history  therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do  however virtuous  can be accomplished alone  therefore we must  be saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint. Therefore we must be saved  by that final form of love  which is forgiveness.  Thanks. When I was born  there was really only one book about how to raise your children  and it was written by Dr. Spock. Thank you for indulging me. I have always wanted to do that. No  it was Benjamin Spock  and his book was called  The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care.  It sold almost    million copies  by the time he died. Today  I  as the mother of a six year old  walk into Barnes and Noble  and see this. And it is amazing the variety that one finds  on those shelves. There are guides to raising  an eco friendly kid  a gluten free kid  a disease proof kid  which  if you ask me  is a little bit creepy. There are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home. There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid and a science minded kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga. Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb  there is pretty much a guide to everything. All of these books are well intentioned. I am sure that many of them are great. But taken together  I am sorry  I do not see help when I look at that shelf. I see anxiety. I see a giant candy colored monument to our collective panic  and it makes me want to know  why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion  Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing human beings have been doing successfully for millennia  long before parenting message boards and peer reviewed studies came along  Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis  Crisis might seem like a strong word  but there is data suggesting it probably isn't. There was  in fact  a paper of just this very name   Parenthood as Crisis   published in       and in the    plus years since  there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish. Parents experience more stress than non parents. Their marital satisfaction is lower. There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids  and the answer often is  not so great. Last year  I spoke with a researcher named Matthew Killingsworth who is doing a very  very imaginative project that tracks people's happiness  and here is what he told me he found   Interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse  which is better than interacting with other relatives  which is better than interacting with acquaintances  which is better than interacting with parents  which is better than interacting with children. Who are on par with strangers.  But here's the thing. I have been looking at what underlies these data for three years  and children are not the problem. Something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem. Specifically  I don't think we know what parenting is supposed to be. Parent  as a verb  only entered common usage in     . Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed. The roles of our children have changed. We are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script  and if you're an amazing jazz musician  then improv is great  but for the rest of us  it can kind of feel like a crisis. So how did we get here  How is it that we are all now navigating a child rearing universe without any norms to guide us  Well  for starters  there has been a major historical change. Until fairly recently  kids worked  on our farms primarily  but also in factories  mills  mines. Kids were considered economic assets. Sometime during the Progressive Era  we put an end to this arrangement. We recognized kids had rights  we banned child labor  we focused on education instead  and school became a child's new work. And thank God it did. But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way. The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical  but it was reciprocal. We provided food  clothing  shelter  and moral instruction to our kids  and they in return provided income. Once kids stopped working  the economics of parenting changed. Kids became  in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist   economically worthless but emotionally priceless.  Rather than them working for us  we began to work for them  because within only a matter of decades it became clear  if we wanted our kids to succeed  school was not enough. Today  extracurricular activities are a kid's new work  but that's work for us too  because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice. Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work  but that's also work for us  because we have to check it. About three years ago  a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart. She said  almost casually   Homework is the new dinner.  The middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its kids  even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give. Mothers now spend more time with their children than they did in       when most women were not even in the workforce. It would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for. This is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding. We have no clue what portion our wisdom  if any  is of use to our kids. The world is changing so rapidly  it's impossible to say. This was true even when I was young. When I was a kid  high school specifically  I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese. And with all due respect to the Japanese  it didn't turn out that way. Now there is a certain kind of middle class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin  and maybe they're onto something  but we cannot know for sure. So  absent being able to anticipate the future  what we all do  as good parents  is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future  hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off. We teach our kids chess  thinking maybe they will need analytical skills. We sign them up for team sports  thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills  you know  for when they go to Harvard Business School. We try and teach them to be financially savvy and science minded and eco friendly and gluten free  though now is probably a good time to tell you that I was not eco friendly and gluten free as a child. I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef. And you know what  I'm doing okay. I pay my taxes. I hold down a steady job. I was even invited to speak at TED. But the presumption now is that what was good enough for me  or for my folks for that matter  isn't good enough anymore. So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf  because we feel like if we aren't trying everything  it's as if we're doing nothing and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids. So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers. Now add to this problem something else  we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce. This is another reason  I think  that parenthood feels like a crisis. We have no rules  no scripts  no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners. The writer Michael Lewis once put this very  very well. He said that the surest way for a couple to start fighting is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs  because the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this   So  did you catch that Dave is the one who walks them to school every morning   Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world  couples fight  and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes. Mothers are much more likely to be multi tasking when they are at home  and fathers  when they are at home  are much more likely to be mono tasking. Find a guy at home  and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time. In fact  UCLA recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle class homes. Guess what it was  Dad in a room by himself. According to the American Time Use Survey  mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers  which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day  but I still think that something she wrote is highly relevant   I have not been alone in the bathroom since October.  But here is the thing  Men are doing plenty. They spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them. They work more paid hours  on average  than their wives  and they genuinely want to be good  involved dads. Today  it is fathers  not mothers  who report the most work life conflict. Either way  by the way  if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles  just imagine what it's like now for non traditional families  families with two dads  families with two moms  single parent households. They are truly improvising as they go. Now  in a more progressive country  and forgive me here for capitulating to clich  and invoking  yes  Sweden  parents could rely on the state for support. There are countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers. Unfortunately  the United States is not one of them  so in case you were wondering what the U.S. has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia  it's this  We too have no paid maternity leave policy. We are one of eight known countries that does not. In this age of intense confusion  there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree  and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms  helicopters or drones  our kids' happiness is paramount. That is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless. We are all the custodians of their self esteem. The one mantra no parent ever questions is   All I want is for my children to be happy.  And don't get me wrong  I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child. But it is a very elusive one. Happiness and self confidence  teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field. It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike. There's no curriculum for it. Happiness and self confidence can be the byproducts of other things  but they cannot really be goals unto themselves. A child's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent. And happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid. And I have to tell you  I think it leads to some very strange excesses. We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world's ugliness that we now shield them from  Sesame Street.  I wish I could say I was kidding about this  but if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of  Sesame Street  on DVD  as I did out of nostalgia  you will find a warning at the beginning saying that the content is not suitable for children. Can I just repeat that  The content of the original  Sesame Street  is not suitable for children. When asked about this by The New York Times  a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations. One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it. Bad modeling. I don't know. But the thing that stuck with me is she said that she didn't know whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today because he was too depressive. I cannot tell you how much this distresses me. You are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the Muppets hanging from her cubicle wall. The offending muppet  right there. That's my son the day he was born. I was high as a kite on morphine. I had had an unexpected C section. But even in my opiate haze  I managed to have one very clear thought the first time I held him. I whispered it into his ear. I said   I will try so hard not to hurt you.  It was the Hippocratic Oath  and I didn't even know I was saying it. But it occurs to me now that the Hippocratic Oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness. In fact  as any parent will tell you  it's awfully hard. All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back. I think in another era we did not expect quite so much from ourselves  and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our hearts racing at those bookshelves. I'm not really sure how to create new norms for this world  but I do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids  we may be assuming the wrong moral burden. It strikes me as a better goal  and  dare I say  a more virtuous one  to focus on making productive kids and moral kids  and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do and their accomplishments and the love that they feel from us. That  anyway  is one response to having no script. Absent having new scripts  we just follow the oldest ones in the book    decency  a work ethic  love   and let happiness and self esteem take care of themselves. I think if we all did that  the kids would still be all right  and so would their parents  possibly in both cases even better. Thank you. I want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you    or  if you were delivering  about the person you were delivering. And you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud. It was    the first two were   It's a ...  Audience   Mixed reply  Girl. Boy. Well  it shows you that    I also deal with issues where there's not certainty of whether it's a girl or a boy  so the mixed answer was very appropriate. Of course  now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound  unless the prospective parents choose to be surprised  like we all were. But I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement on the third word  because the third word is a description of your sex. And by that I mean  made by a description of your genitals. Now  as a pediatric endocrinologist  I used to be very  very involved and still somewhat am  in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals  and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex. But there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you. And when I talk about definition  I'm talking about your sexual orientation. We don't say   It's a ... gay boy    A lesbian girl   Those situations don't really define themselves more until the second decade of life. Nor do they define your gender  which  as different from your anatomic sex  describes your self concept  Do you see yourself as a male or female  or somewhere in the spectrum in between  That sometimes shows up in the first decade of life  but it can be very confusing for parents  because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross gender play and way  and  in fact  there are studies that show that even    percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins. But  at the time that puberty begins    that means between about age    to    in girls     to    in boys    with breast budding  or two to three times' increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males  by that particular point  the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings  no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things. Now  this is relatively rare  so I had relatively little personal experience with this. And my experience was more typical  only because I had an adolescent practice. And I saw someone age     genetically female  went through Harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story  a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name  and came to me after graduating  saying   Help me. I know you know a lot of endocrinology.  And indeed  I've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads. This wasn't rocket science. But I made a deal with him   I'll treat you if you teach me.  And so he did. And what an education I got from taking care of all the members of his support group. And then I got really confused  because I thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the gender in which they were affirming. But then my patient married  and he married a woman who had been born as a male  had married as a male  had two children  then went through a transition into female. And now this delightful female was attached to my male patient    in fact  got legally married  because they showed up as a man and a woman  and who knew  right  And I was confused     Does this make so and so gay  Does this make so and so straight   I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity. And my patient said to me   Look  look  look. If you just think of the following  you'll get it right  Sexual orientation is who you go to bed with. Gender identity is who you go to bed as.  And I subsequently learned from the many adults    I took care of about     adults    I learned from them that if I didn't peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room  I would never be able to guess better than chance  whether they were gay  straight  bi or asexual in their affirmed gender. In other words  one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other. And the data show it. Now  as I took care of the     adults  I found it extremely painful. These people    many of them    had to give up so much of their lives. Sometimes their parents would reject them  siblings  their own children  and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children. It was so awful  but why did they do it at    and     Because they felt they had to affirm themselves before they would kill themselves. And indeed  the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world. So  what to do  I was intrigued  in going to a conference in Holland  where they are experts in this  and saw the most remarkable thing. They were treating young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender  and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn't want. Because basically  kids look about the same  each sex  until they go through puberty  at which point  if you feel you're in the wrong sex  you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey. The fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be  with puberty  actually is nullified by the puberty you get. And they fall apart. So that's why putting the puberty on hold    why on hold  You can't just give them the opposite hormones that young. They'll end up stunted in growth  and you think you can have a meaningful conversation about the fertility effects of such treatment with a    year old girl  a    year old boy  So this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years  so that they can work it out. They can have more and more testing  they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them. And then  in a program they call           around age    is when they give the blocking hormones  and then at age     with retesting  they re qualify to receive    now remember  the blocking hormones are reversible  but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex  you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change  depending on what you're using  and those effects are permanent  or require surgery to remove  or electrolysis  and you can never really affect the voice. So this is serious  and this is         year old stuff. And then at     they're eligible for surgery. And while there's no good surgery for females to males genitally  the male to female surgery has fooled gynecologists. That's how good it can be. So I looked at how the patients were doing  and I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else  except they were pubertally delayed. But once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm  they look beautiful. They look normal. They had normal heights. You would never be able to pick them out in a crowd. So at that point  I decided I'm going to do this. This is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in  because  in fact  if you're going to deal with it in kids aged    to     that's pediatric endocrinology. So I brought some kids in  and this now became the standard of care  and the  Boston  Children's Hospital was behind it. By my showing them the kids before and after  people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated  and pictures of the Dutch    they came to me and said   You've got to do something for these kids.  Well  where were these kids before  They were out there suffering  is where they were. So we started a program in     . It became the first program of its kind    but it's really of the Dutch kind    in North America. And since then  we have     patients. Did they come from Afghanistan  No.    percent of them came from within     miles of Boston. And some came from England. Jackie had been abused in the Midlands  in England. She's    years old there  she was living as a girl  but she was being beaten up. It was a horror show  they had to homeschool her. And the reason the British were coming was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age     which means they were consigning them to an adult body no matter what happened  even if they tested them well. Jackie  on top of it  was  by virtue of skeletal markings  destined to be six feet five. And yet  she had just begun a male puberty. Well  I did something a little bit innovative  because I do know hormones  and that estrogen is much more potent in closing epiphyses  the growth plates  and stopping growth  than testosterone is. So we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone  but we added estrogen  not at     but at   . And so here she is at     on the left. And on her   th birthday  she went to Thailand  where they would do a genital plastic surgery. They will do it at    now. And she ended up  '   . But more than that  she has normal breast size  because by blocking testosterone  every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age  not too late. And on the far right  there she is. She went public    semifinalist in the Miss England competition. The judges debated as to  can they do this  And one of them quipped  I'm told   But she has more natural self than half the other contestants.  And some of them have been rearranged a little bit  but it's all her DNA. And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman. And she was offered contracts as a model  at which point she teased me  when she said   You know  I might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one.  Go figure. So this picture  I think  says it all. It really says it all. These are Nicole and brother Jonas  identical twin boys  and proven to be identical. Nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three. At age seven  they changed her name  and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty. Now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only     that male puberty is early in this family  because he looks more like a    year old. But it makes the point all the more  of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is. Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here  and Jonas is just going    biologic control. This is what Nicole would look like if we weren't doing what we were doing. He's got a prominent Adam's apple. He's got angular bones to the face  a mustache  and you can see there's a height difference  because he's gone through a growth spurt that she won't get. Now Nicole is on estrogen. She has a bit of a form to her. This family went to the White House last spring  because of their work in overturning an anti discrimination    there was a bill that would block the right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms  and it looked like the bill was going to pass  and that would have been a problem  but Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine and said   I can do this. If they see me  they'll understand why I'm no threat in the ladies' room  but I can be threatened in the men's room.  And then they finally got it. So where do we go from here  Well  we still have a ways to go in terms of anti discrimination. There are only    states that have an anti discrimination law against discrimination in housing  employment  public accommodation    only    states  and five of them are in New England. We need less expensive drugs. They cost a fortune. And we need to get this condition out of the DSM. It is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian  and that went out the window in       and the whole world changed. And this isn't going to break anybody's budget. This is not that common. But the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide  but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society. Thank you. The universe is teeming with planets. I want us  in the next decade  to build a space telescope that'll be able to image an Earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life. My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years. Astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet  and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an Earth like planet that might be able to harbor life  but we haven't seen any of them. We've only detected them indirectly. This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot. It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in       when they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system to take a picture of the Earth from six billion kilometers away. I want to take that of an Earth like planet about another star. Why haven't we done that  Why is that hard  Well to see  let's imagine we take the Hubble Space Telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of Mars. We'll see something like that  a slightly blurry picture of the Earth  because we're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars. Now let's move ten times further away. Here we are at the orbit of Uranus. It's gotten smaller  it's got less detail  less resolve. We can still see the little moon  but let's go ten times further away again. Here we are at the edge of the solar system  out at the Kuiper Belt. Now it's not resolved at all. It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's. But let's move yet again ten times further away. Here we are out at the Oort Cloud  outside the solar system  and we're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is. One more time  ten times further away. Now we're at Alpha Centauri  our nearest neighbor star  and the planet is gone. All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that's ten billion times brighter than the planet  which should be in that little red circle. That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard. The light from the star is diffracting. It's scattering inside the telescope  creating that very bright image that washes out the planet. So to see the planet  we have to do something about all of that light. We have to get rid of it. I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that  but I want to tell you about one today that I think is the coolest  and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade. It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer  the father of the space telescope  in       and he took his inspiration from an eclipse. You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse. The moon has moved in front of the sun. It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it. It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye  I can see you in the back row. Well  what's going on  Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth. We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow  we look back at the sun  and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim  fine structure in the corona. Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space. We build a big screen  we fly it in space  we put it up in front of the star  we block out most of the light  we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created  and boom  we get to see planets. Well that would look something like this. So there's that big screen  and there's no planets  because unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well  because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope. It's like water bending around a rock in a stream  and all that light just destroys the shadow. It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets. But Spitzer actually knew the answer. If we can feather the edges  soften those edges so we can control diffraction  well then we can see a planet  and in the last    years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that. It looks something like that. We call that our flower petal starshade. If we make the edges of those petals exactly right  if we control their shape  we can control diffraction  and now we have a great shadow. It's about    billion times dimmer than it was before  and we can see the planets beam out just like that. That  of course  has to be bigger than my thumb. That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly        kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow  and then we can see those planets. This sounds formidable  but brilliant engineers  colleagues of mine at JPL  came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this. It starts wrapped around a hub. It separates from the telescope. The petals unfurl  they open up  the telescope turns around. Then you'll see it flip and fly out that        kilometers away from the telescope. It's going to move in front of the star just like that  creates a wonderful shadow. Boom  we get planets orbiting about it. Thank you. That's not science fiction. We've been working on this for the last five or six years. Last summer  we did a really cool test out in California at Northrop Grumman. So those are four petals. This is a sub scale star shade. It's about half the size of the one you just saw. You'll see the petals unfurl. Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL. Now you're seeing it deploy. Those petals have to rotate into place. The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter. We ran this test    times  and    times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter. This has to be done very precisely  but if we can do this  if we can build this technology  if we can get it into space  you might see something like this. That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. If we can take a similar space telescope  slightly larger  put it out there  fly an occulter in front of it  what we might see is something like that    that's a family portrait of our solar system    but not ours. We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter  through a starshade like that. You can see Jupiter  you can see Saturn  Uranus  Neptune  and right there in the center  next to the residual light is that pale blue dot. That's Earth. We want to see that  see if there's water  oxygen  ozone  the things that might tell us that it could harbor life. I think this is the coolest possible science. That's why I got into doing this  because I think that will change the world. That will change everything when we see that. Thank you. Type is something we consume in enormous quantities. In much of the world  it's completely inescapable. But few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it  if  indeed  there was any human agency involved in its creation  if it didn't just sort of materialize out of the software ether. But I do have to be concerned with those things. It's my job. I'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape by the bad spacing of the T and the E that you see there. I've got to take that slide off. I can't stand it. Nor can Chris. There. Good. So my talk is about the connection between technology and design of type. The technology has changed a number of times since I started work  photo  digital  desktop  screen  web. I've had to survive those changes and try to understand their implications for what I do for design. This slide is about the effect of tools on form. The two letters  the two K's  the one on your left  my right  is modern  made on a computer. All straight lines are dead straight. The curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness that the B zier formula imposes. On the right  ancient Gothic  cut in the resistant material of steel by hand. None of the straight lines are actually straight. The curves are kind of subtle. It has that spark of life from the human hand that the machine or the program can never capture. What a contrast. Well  I tell a lie. A lie at TED. I'm really sorry. Both of these were made on a computer  same software  same B zier curves  same font format. The one on your left was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre  and I did the other one. The tool is the same  yet the letters are different. The letters are different because the designers are different. That's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that. I wanted mine to look like that. End of story. Type is very adaptable. Unlike a fine art  such as sculpture or architecture  type hides its methods. I think of myself as an industrial designer. The thing I design is manufactured  and it has a function  to be read  to convey meaning. But there is a bit more to it than that. There's the sort of aesthetic element. What makes these two letters different from different interpretations by different designers  What gives the work of some designers sort of characteristic personal style  as you might find in the work of a fashion designer  an automobile designer  whatever  There have been some cases  I admit  where I as a designer did feel the influence of technology. This is from the mid '  s  the change from metal type to photo  hot to cold. This brought some benefits but also one particular drawback  a spacing system that only provided    discrete units for letters to be accommodated on. I was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible within this    unit box. Quickly looking at the arithmetic  I realized I could only actually make three of related design. Here you see them. In Helvetica Compressed  Extra Compressed  and Ultra Compressed  this rigid    unit system really boxed me in. It kind of determined the proportions of the design. Here are the typefaces  at least the lower cases. So do you look at these and say   Poor Matthew  he had to submit to a problem  and by God it shows in the results.  I hope not. If I were doing this same job today  instead of having    spacing units  I would have      . Clearly I could make more variants  but would these three members of the family be better  It's hard to say without actually doing it  but they would not be better in the proportion of       to     I can tell you that. My instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight  because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit  and as I said  type is very adaptable. It does hide its methods. All industrial designers work within constraints. This is not fine art. The question is  does a constraint force a compromise  By accepting a constraint  are you working to a lower standard  I don't believe so  and I've always been encouraged by something that Charles Eames said. He said he was conscious of working within constraints  but not of making compromises. The distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle  but it's very central to my attitude to work. Remember this reading experience  The phone book. I'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia. This is from the mid '  s early trials of Bell Centennial typeface I designed for the U.S. phone books  and it was my first experience of digital type  and quite a baptism. Designed for the phone books  as I said  to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack. This is not a hospitable environment for a typographic designer. So the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions. As I say  we were in the infancy of digital type. I had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper    there were four weights of Bell Centennial   pixel by pixel  then encode them raster line by raster line for the keyboard. It took two years  but I learned a lot. These letters look as though they've been chewed by the dog or something or other  but the missing pixels at the intersections of strokes or in the crotches are the result of my studying the effects of ink spread on cheap paper and reacting  revising the font accordingly. These strange artifacts are designed to compensate for the undesirable effects of scale and production process. At the outset  AT T had wanted to set the phone books in Helvetica  but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said in the Helvetica movie  if you've seen that  the letters in Helvetica were designed to be as similar to one another as possible. This is not the recipe for legibility at small size. It looks very elegant up on a slide. I had to disambiguate these forms of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial by sort of opening the shapes up  as you can see in the bottom part of that slide. So now we're on to the mid '  s  the early days of digital outline fonts  vector technology. There was an issue at that time with the size of the fonts  the amount of data that was required to find and store a font in computer memory. It limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time. I did an analysis of the data  and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle because of all the points required to define the elegantly curved serif brackets. The numbers at the bottom of the slide  by the way  they represent the amount of data needed to store each of the fonts. So the sans serif  in the middle  sans the serifs  was much more economical     to    .  Aha   I thought.  The engineers have a problem. Designer to the rescue.  I made a serif type  you can see it on the right  without curved serifs. I made them polygonal  out of straight line segments  chamfered brackets. And look  as economical in data as a sans serif. We call it Charter  on the right. So I went to the head of engineering with my numbers  and I said proudly   I have solved your problem.   Oh   he said.  What problem   And I said   Well  you know  the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on.   Oh   he said.  We solved that problem last week. We wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude. You can have as many fonts on your system as you like.   Well  thank you for letting me know   I said. Foiled again. I was left with a design solution for a nonexistent technical problem. But here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me. I didn't just throw my design away in a fit of pique. I persevered. What had started as a technical exercise became an aesthetic exercise  really. In other words  I had come to like this typeface. Forget its origins. Screw that. I liked the design for its own sake. The simplified forms of Charter gave it a sort of plain spoken quality and unfussy spareness that sort of pleased me. You know  at times of technical innovation  designers want to be influenced by what's in the air. We want to respond. We want to be pushed into exploring something new. So Charter is a sort of parable for me  really. In the end  there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of Charter. I had really misunderstood the technology. The technology did suggest something to me  but it did not force my hand  and I think this happens very often. You know  engineers are very smart  and despite occasional frustrations because I'm less smart  I've always enjoyed working with them and learning from them. Apropos  in the mid '  s  I started talking to Microsoft about screen fonts. Up to that point  all the fonts on screen had been adapted from previously existing printing fonts  of course. But Microsoft foresaw correctly the movement  the stampede towards electronic communication  to reading and writing onscreen with the printed output as being sort of secondary in importance. So the priorities were just tipping at that point. They wanted a small core set of fonts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen  which were their coarse resolution displays. I said to Microsoft  a typeface designed for a particular technology is a self obsoleting typeface. I've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems. Thanks to the engineers  the technical problems went away. So did my typeface. It was only a stopgap. Microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away. So I thought  well  a decade  that's not bad  that's more than a stopgap. So I was persuaded  I was convinced  and we went to work on what became Verdana and Georgia  for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up. At that time  screens were binary. The pixel was either on or it was off. Here you see the outline of a letter  the cap H  which is the thin black line  the contour  which is how it is stored in memory  superimposed on the bitmap  which is the grey area  which is how it's displayed on the screen. The bitmap is rasterized from the outline. Here in a cap H  which is all straight lines  the two are in almost perfect sync on the Cartesian grid. Not so with an O. This looks more like bricklaying than type design  but believe me  this is a good bitmap O  for the simple reason that it's symmetrical in both x and y axes. In a binary bitmap  you actually can't ask for more than that. I would sometimes make  I don't know  three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase A  and then stand back to choose which was the best. Well  there was no best  so the designer's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad. Is that a compromise  Not to me  if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow  although that standard may be well short of the ideal. You may be able to see on this slide two different bitmap fonts there. The  a  in the upper one  I think  is better than the  a  in the lower one  but it still ain't great. You can maybe see the effect better if it's reduced. Well  maybe not. So I'm a pragmatist  not an idealist  out of necessity. For a certain kind of temperament  there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability. Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic. The bitmap looks jagged and rough. It is jagged and rough. But I discovered  by experiment  that there is an optimum slant for an italic on a screen so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries. Look in this example how  rough as it is  how the left and right legs actually break at the same level. That's a victory. That's good  right there. And of course  at the lower depths  you don't get much choice. This is an S  in case you were wondering. Well  it's been    years now since Verdana and Georgia were released. Microsoft were absolutely right  it took a good    years  but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution  and very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti aliasing and so on. So now that their mission is accomplished  has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that I designed for coarser displays back then  Will they outlive the now obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market  Or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology  In other words  have they been absorbed into the typographic mainstream  I'm not sure  but they've had a good run so far. Hey     is a good age for anything with present day rates of attrition  so I'm not complaining. Thank you. I feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the Museum of Modern Art on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray. I learned so much from her. After the curator Robert Storr selected all the paintings from her lifetime body of work  I loved looking at the paintings from the     s. There were some motifs and elements that would come up again later in her life. I remember asking her what she thought of those early works. If you didn't know they were hers  you might not have been able to guess. She told me that a few didn't quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be. One of the works  in fact  so didn't meet her mark  she had set it out in the trash in her studio  and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value. In that moment  my view of success and creativity changed. I realized that success is a moment  but what we're always celebrating is creativity and mastery. But this is the thing  What gets us to convert success into mastery  This is a question I've long asked myself. I think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win. I started to understand this when I went on one cold May day to watch a set of varsity archers  all women as fate would have it  at the northern tip of Manhattan at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex. I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox  the idea that in order to actually hit your target  you have to aim at something slightly skew from it. I stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van  and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus. One held a half eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching. And they passed me and smiled  but they sized me up as they made their way to the turf  and spoke to each other not with words but with numbers  degrees  I thought  positions for how they might plan to hit their target. I stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support  and watched her  and I didn't understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring. The ten ring from the standard    yard distance  it looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm's length. And this is while holding    pounds of draw weight on each shot. She first hit a seven  I remember  and then a nine  and then two tens  and then the next arrow didn't even hit the target. And I saw that gave her more tenacity  and she went after it again and again. For three hours this went on. At the end of the practice  one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just star fished  her head looking up at the sky  trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call that still point of the turning world. It's so rare in American culture  there's so little that's vocational about it anymore  to look at what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude  what it means to align your body posture for three hours in order to hit a target  pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity. But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing what's so rare to glimpse  that difference between success and mastery. So success is hitting that ten ring  but mastery is knowing that it means nothing if you can't do it again and again. Mastery is not just the same as excellence  though. It's not the same as success  which I see as an event  a moment in time  and a label that the world confers upon you. Mastery is not a commitment to a goal but to a constant pursuit. What gets us to do this  what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win. How many times have we designated something a classic  a masterpiece even  while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished  riddled with difficulties and flaws  in other words  a near win  Elizabeth Murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings. Painter Paul C zanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again  but at the end of his life  the result was that he had only signed    percent of his paintings. His favorite novel was  The  Unknown  Masterpiece  by Honor  de Balzac  and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself. Franz Kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise  so much so that he wanted all of his diaries  manuscripts  letters and even sketches burned upon his death. His friend refused to honor the request  and because of that  we now have all the works we now do by Kafka   America    The Trial  and  The Castle   a work so incomplete it even stops mid sentence. The pursuit of mastery  in other words  is an ever onward almost.  Lord  grant that I desire more than I can accomplish   Michelangelo implored  as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel  and he himself was that Adam with his finger outstretched and not quite touching that God's hand. Mastery is in the reaching  not the arriving. It's in constantly wanting to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be. Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career. How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon  We see it even in the life of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders  who tells me that his triumphs are not merely the result of a grand achievement  but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins. We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge. It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington  who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire was always the next one  always the one he had yet to compose. Part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency  the more clearly we might see that we don't know all that we thought we did. It's called the Dunning Kruger effect. The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin when they asked him   What do you think increases with knowledge   and he said   You learn how little you know.  Success motivates us  but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest. One of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between Olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition. Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel compared to bronze  who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all  gives silver medalists a focus on follow up competition. We see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these scratch off tickets that had a higher than average rate of near wins and so compelled people to buy more tickets that they were called heart stoppers  and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in Britain in the     s. The reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals  which we tend to put at a distance  into more proximate vicinity to where we stand. If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week  you might describe it in more general terms. But if I ask you to describe a great day at TED tomorrow  you might describe it with granular  practical clarity. And this is what a near win does. It gets us to focus on what  right now  we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights. It's Jackie Joyner Kersee  who in      missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one third of a second  and her husband predicted that would give her the tenacity she needed in follow up competition. In       she won the gold in the heptathlon and set a record of       points  a score that no athlete has come very close to since. We thrive not when we've done it all  but when we still have more to do. I stand here thinking and wondering about all the different ways that we might even manufacture a near win in this room  how your lives might play this out  because I think on some gut level we do know this. We know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge  and it's why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths. In Navajo culture  some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics. It's what's called a spirit line  a deliberate flaw in the pattern to give the weaver or maker a way out  but also a reason to continue making work. Masters are not experts because they take a subject to its conceptual end. They're masters because they realize that there isn't one. Now it occurred to me  as I thought about this  why the archery coach told me at the end of that practice  out of earshot of his archers  that he and his colleagues never feel they can do enough for their team  never feel there are enough visualization techniques and posture drills to help them overcome those constant near wins. It didn't sound like a complaint  exactly  but just a way to let me know  a kind of tender admission  to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious  unfinished path that always required more. We build out of the unfinished idea  even if that idea is our former self. This is the dynamic of mastery. Coming close to what you thought you wanted can help you attain more than you ever dreamed you could. It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray was thinking when I saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries. Even if we created utopias  I believe we would still have the incomplete. Completion is a goal  but we hope it is never the end. Thank you. Wow  this is bright. It must use a lot of power. Well  flying you all in here must have cost a bit of energy too. So the whole planet needs a lot of energy  and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel. We've been burning gas. It's been a good run. It got us to where we are  but we have to stop. We can't do that anymore. So we are trying different types of energy now  alternative energy  but it proved quite difficult to find something that's as convenient and as cost effective as oil  gas and coal. My personal favorite is nuclear energy. Now  it's very energy dense  it produces solid  reliable power  and it doesn't make any CO . Now we know of two ways of making nuclear energy  fission and fusion. Now in fission  you take a big nucleus  you break it in part  in two  and it makes lots of energy  and this is how the nuclear reactor today works. It works pretty good. And then there's fusion. Now  I like fusion. Fusion's much better. So you take two small nuclei  you put it together  and you make helium  and that's very nice. It makes lots of energy. This is nature's way of producing energy. The sun and all the stars in the universe run on fusion. Now  a fusion plant would actually be quite cost effective and it also would be quite safe. It only produces short term radioactive waste  and it cannot melt down. Now  the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean. In the ocean  you can extract the fuel for about one thousandth of a cent per kilowatt hour  so that's very  very cheap. And if the whole planet would run on fusion  we could extract the fuel from the ocean. It would run for billions and billions of years. Now  if fusion is so great  why don't we have it  Where is it  Well  there's always a bit of a catch. Fusion is really  really hard to do. So the problem is  those two nuclei  they are both positively charged  so they don't want to fuse. They go like this. They go like that. So in order to make them fuse  you have to throw them at each other with great speed  and if they have enough speed  they will go against the repulsion  they will touch  and they will make energy. Now  the particle speed is a measure of the temperature. So the temperature required for fusion is     billion degrees C. This is rather warm  and this is why fusion is so hard to do. Now  I caught my little fusion bug when I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia  and then I got a big job in a laser printer place making printing for the printing industry. I worked there for    years  and I got a little bit bored  and then I was     and I got a mid life crisis  you know  the usual thing  Who am I  What should I do  What should I do  What can I do  And then I was looking at my good work  and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests around here in B.C. and burying you  all of you  in millions of tons of junk mail. Now  that was not very satisfactory. So some people buy a Porsche. Others get a mistress. But I've decided to get my bit to solve global warming and make fusion happen. Now  so the first thing I did is I looked into the literature and I see  how does fusion work  So the physicists have been working on fusion for a while  and one of the ways they do it is with something called a tokamak. It's a big ring of magnetic coil  superconducting coil  and it makes a magnetic field in a ring like this  and the hot gas in the middle  which is called a plasma  is trapped. The particles go round and round and round the circle at the wall. Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there to try to cook that to fusion temperature. So this is the inside of one of those donuts  and on the right side you can see the fusion plasma in there. Now  a second way of doing this is by using laser fusion. Now in laser fusion  you have a little ping pong ball  you put the fusion fuel in the center  and you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it. The lasers are very strong  and it squashes the ping pong ball really  really quick. And if you squeeze something hard enough  it gets hotter  and if it gets really  really fast  and they do that in one billionth of a second  it makes enough energy and enough heat to make fusion. So this is the inside of one such machine. You see the laser beam and the pellet in the center. Now  most people think that fusion is going nowhere. They always think that the physicists are in their lab and they're working hard  but nothing is happening. That's actually not quite true. This is a curve of the gain in fusion over the last    years or so  and you can see that we're making now about        times more fusion than we used to when we started. That's a pretty good gain. As a matter of fact  it's as fast as the fabled Moore's Law that defined the amount of transistors they can put on a chip. Now  this dot here is called JET  the Joint European Torus. It's a big tokamak donut in Europe  and this machine in      produced    megawatts of fusion power with    megawatts of heat. Now  you say  that's not much use  but it's actually pretty close  considering we can get about        times more than we started. The second dot here is the NIF. It's the National Ignition Facility. It's a big laser machine in the U.S.  and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in  the center of the ping pong ball. Now  that's not quite good enough  because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that  but it was pretty good. Now this is ITER  pronounced in French  EE tairh. So this is a big collaboration of different countries that are building a huge magnetic donut in the south of France  and this machine  when it's finished  will produce     megawatts of fusion power with only    megawatts to make it. So this one is the real one. It's going to work. That's the kind of machine that makes energy. Now if you look at the graph  you will notice that those two dots are a little bit on the right of the curve. We kind of have fallen off the progress. Actually  the science to make those machines was really in time to produce fusion during that curve. However  there has been a bit of politics going on  and the will to do it was not there  so it drifted to the right. ITER  for example  could have been built in      or       but because it's a big international collaboration  the politics got in and it delayed it a bit. For example  it took them about three years to decide where to put it. Now  fusion is often criticized for being a little too expensive. Yes  it did cost a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year to make this progress. But you have to compare that to the cost of making Moore's Law. That cost way more than that. The result of Moore's Law is this cell phone here in my pocket. This cell phone  and the Internet behind it  cost about one trillion dollars  just so I can take a selfie and put it on Facebook. Then when my dad sees that  he'll be very proud. We also spend about     billion dollars a year in subsidies for oil and gas and renewable energy. Now  we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion. So me  personally  I don't think it's too expensive. I think it's actually been shortchanged  considering it can solve all our energy problems cleanly for the next couple of billions of years. Now I can say that  but I'm a little bit biased  because I started a fusion company and I don't even have a Facebook account. So when I started this fusion company in       I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads. They had much more resources than me. So I decided I would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster. Now magnetic and laser fusion are pretty good machines. They are awesome pieces of technology  wonderful machines  and they have shown that fusion can be done. However  as a power plant  I don't think they're very good. They're way too big  way too complicated  way too expensive  and also  they don't deal very much with the fusion energy. When you make fusion  the energy comes out as neutrons  fast neutrons comes out of the plasma. Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine. It damages it. And also  you have to catch the heat from those neutrons and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere  and on those machines  it was all a bit of an afterthought. So I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that. So back to the literature  and I read about the fusion everywhere. One way in particular attracted my attention  and it's called magnetized target fusion  or MTF for short. Now  in MTF  what you want to do is you take a big vat and you fill that with liquid metal  and you spin the liquid metal to open a vortex in the center  a bit like your sink. When you pull the plug on a sink  it makes a vortex. And then you have some pistons driven by pressure that goes on the outside  and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma  and it compresses it  it gets hotter  like a laser  and then it makes fusion. So it's a bit of a mix between a magnetized fusion and the laser fusion. So those have a couple of very good advantages. The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall  and therefore there's no damage to the machine. The liquid metal gets hot  so you can pump that in a heat exchanger  make some steam  spin a turbine. So that's a very convenient way of doing this part of the process. And finally  all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from steam powered pistons  which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils. Now  this was all very good except for the problem that it didn't quite work. There's always a catch. So when you compress that  the plasma cools down faster than the compression speed  so you're trying to compress it  but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing. So when I saw that  I said  well  this is such a shame  because it's a very  very good idea. So hopefully I can improve on that. So I thought about it for a minute  and I said  okay  how can we make that work better  So then I thought about impact. What about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this  in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in  That won't work. So what the idea is is to use the idea of an impact. So we accelerate the pistons with steam  that takes a little bit of time  but then  bang  you hit the piston  and  baff   all the energy is done instantly  down instantly to the liquid  and that compresses the plasma much faster. So I decided  okay  this is good  let's make that. So we built this machine in this garage here. We made a small machine that we managed to squeeze a little bit of neutrons out of that  and those are my marketing neutrons  and with those marketing neutrons  then I raised about    million dollars  and I hired    people. That's my team here. And this is what we want to build. So it's going to be a big machine  about three meters in diameter  liquid lead spinning around  big vortex in the center  put the plasma on the top and on the bottom  piston hits on the side  bang   it compresses it  and it will make some energy  and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal  going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine  and some of the steam will go back to fire the piston. We're going to run that about one time per second  and it will produce     megawatts of electricity. Okay  we also built this injector  so this injector makes the plasma to start with. It makes the plasma at about a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C. Unfortunately  it doesn't last quite long enough  so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit  but last month it got a lot better  so I think we have the plasma compressing now. Then we built a small sphere  about this big     pistons around it  and this will compress the liquid. However  plasma is difficult to compress. When you compress it  it tends to go a little bit crooked like that  so you need the timing of the piston to be very good  and for that we use several control systems  which was not possible in       but we now can do that with nice  new electronics. So finally  most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen  but as a matter of fact  fusion is getting very close. We are almost there. The big labs have shown that fusion is doable  and now there are small companies that are thinking about that  and they say  it's not that it cannot be done  but it's how to make it cost effectively. General Fusion is one of those small companies  and hopefully  very soon  somebody  someone  will crack that nut  and perhaps it will be General Fusion. Thank you very much. Scientific breakthrough  the kind that can potentially save lives  can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover  in the evolved  accumulated body of human anecdote  for example  or in the time tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us. Science starts with observation  but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence  isolate them  and test them with scientific rigor. And when we do  the results will often surprise. Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years  unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a    month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide. And so it's not surprising  perhaps  that in July of this year  Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide  and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. And I have for you today the story of that journey  but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention. When we began this process  we were looking  it was about three years ago  and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia  and by chance  in a previous role  I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler. Now Harry Butler  who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist  had spent a lot of time in the marine environment. Harry Butler is a precursor  if you like  to the late Steve Irwin. When I asked him about what the solution to the problem might be  the answer was quite surprising. He said   Take a black wetsuit  band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee  and you'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species.  I didn't think about that much at the time  and it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened  and it caused me to think  maybe there's some merit to this idea. And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues. And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking. So biologically  there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns  warning patterns  to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked  not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark. On the human side  Walter Starck  an oceanographer  has been painting his wetsuit since the     s  and anthropologically  Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god. So what's going on here  Is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define  We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage  particularly for attack  but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target  and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack. It makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote because that's time tested evolution over many millennia. But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts  the idea that there's a kernel of truth thought to be important  passed down from generation to generation  so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior  I wanted to test this idea. I wanted to put some science to this anecdotal evidence  because if science could support this concept  then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose. To do that  I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology  and a worldwide search  again  led to the University of W.A. on the doorstep here  with the Oceans Institute. And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us  confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white  or grayscale. So I called up Nathan  a little bit sheepishly  actually  about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack  and fortunately  he thought that was a good idea. So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government. And we did three key things. The first is that we mapped the characteristics  the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks  so the great white  tiger and bull shark. We did that genetically and we did that anatomically. The next thing we did was to understand  using complex computer modeling  what that eye can see at different depths  distances  light conditions  and water clarity in the ocean. And from there  we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics  what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water  cryptic  and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey or shark food. The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear  and to that end  I invited Ray Smith  a surfer  industrial designer  wetsuit designer  and in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo  to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear. And here's an example of one of the first drawings. So this is what I call a  don't eat me  wetsuit. So this takes that banding idea  takes that banding idea  it's highly visible  provides a highly disruptive profile  and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food  and potentially even create confusion for the shark. And this one's configured to go with a surfboard. You can see that dark  opaque panel on the front  and it's particularly better for the surface  where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic. Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit  or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column. There are three panels on this suit  and in any given conditions  one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially  leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column. And this one's particularly well suited to the dive configuration  so when you're deeper under the water. So we knew that we had some really solid science here. We knew  if you wanted to stand out  you needed to look stripy  and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic  you needed to look like this. But the acid test is always going to be  how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes. And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think. So we have to bait the rig  because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence  and by baiting the rig  we're obviously changing shark behavior. We can't put humans in the water. We're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water. But nevertheless  we started the testing process in January of this year  initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks. The way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait  wrap it in a neoprene skin  and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig. And because we use stereo  we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is  what angle it comes in at  how quickly it leaves  and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way. Because we needed to preserve the scientific method  we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the  what we call  SAMS technology rig. And the results were not just exciting  but very encouraging  and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements. So here we've got a four meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig  which it had encountered about a minute and a half before. Now that exact same shark had engaged  or encountered this SAMS rig  which is the Elude SAMS rig  about eight minutes before  and spent six minutes circling it  hunting for it  looking for what it could smell and sense but not see  and this was the final engagement. Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers  and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig  so a black neoprene wetsuit  and going straight to the bottom  coming up and engaging. In contrast to the SAMS technology rig  this is the banded one  where it's more tactile  it's more investigative  it's more apprehensive  and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go. So  it's important for us that all  the testing is done independently  and the University of W.A. is doing the testing. It'll be an ongoing process. It's subject to peer review and subject to publication. It's so important that this concept is led with the science. From the perspective of Shark  Attack Mitigation Systems  we're a biotechnology licensing company  so we don't make wetsuits ourselves. We'll license others to do that. But I thought you might be interested in seeing what SAMS technology looks like embedded in a wetsuit  and to that end  for the first time  live  worldwide    I can show you what biological adaptation  science and design looks like in real life. So I can welcome Sam  the surfer  from this side. Where are you  Sam  And Eduardo. Cheers  mate. Cheers. Thanks  gentlemen.  Applause  So what have we done here  Well  to my mind  rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention  we've paid attention to the biological evidence  we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence  and we've used science as a tool for translation  translation of something that was already there into something that we can  use for the benefit of mankind. And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation. After all  did the Wright brothers discover manned flight  or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically  replicate it in a way that humans could use  As for the humble wetsuit  who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time  in five years' time or in    years' time  but with this new thinking  I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black. Thank you. A computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression  but for the most part  that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones. And I'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live. A few years ago  I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York  and the next thing I knew  I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays. This one's called  The Chase.  There are two pairs of shoes  a man's pair and a woman's pair  and they play out this slow  tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her personal space  and then she moves away. Each of the shoes has magnets in it  and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around. My friend Andy Cavatorta was building a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour and I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music. The harp has four separate pendulums  and each pendulum has    strings  so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes  and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music. I built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago  and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen. And the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit  and a researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on. And she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit  and were helping people learn in a social way. And when you think about it  this makes a lot of sense  that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily. I mean  our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects. Think about which you find easier to use  a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone  But the thing that struck me about all of these different projects is that they really had to be built from scratch  down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software. I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time. So my first attempt at this was at the MIT Media Lab with Professor Hiroshi Ishii  and we built this array of     different electromagnets  and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface. But the problem with this was that these magnets cost over        dollars. Although each one was pretty small  altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag. So I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface. So to explore this idea  I built an army of small robots  and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels. They're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions  and when you couple these robots with a video projector  you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information. So here's an example of what I mean. This is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical. So if we want to tweak the color  we just enter the color mode  and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color  or if we want to adjust the audio  then we get two different dials for that  these physical objects. So here the left and right channel stay in sync  but if we want to  we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time. So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that's designed in software. And this is a mapping application for disaster response. So you have these physical objects that represent police  fire and rescue  and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go  and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world. This is a video chat application. It's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object. With this interface  we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games  where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible. But one of the areas that I'm most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone. One example of those is protein folding. So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein  and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways. And if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation  we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us. So feeling what's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction. So we're just beginning to explore what's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment. Maybe this is the computer of the future. There's no touchscreen. There's no technology visible at all. But when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk  the objects on the table come alive. Thank you. So  a few years ago I was at JFK Airport about to get on a flight  when I was approached by two women who I do not think would be insulted to hear themselves described as tiny old tough talking Italian American broads. The taller one  who is like up here  she comes marching up to me  and she goes   Honey  I gotta ask you something. You got something to do with that whole 'Eat  Pray  Love' thing that's been going on lately   And I said   Yes  I did.  And she smacks her friend and she goes   See  I told you  I said  that's that girl. That's that girl who wrote that book based on that movie.  So that's who I am. And believe me  I'm extremely grateful to be that person  because that whole  Eat  Pray  Love  thing was a huge break for me. But it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world I was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody  because I knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored  Eat  Pray  Love  were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it wasn't going to be  Eat  Pray  Love   and all of those people who had hated  Eat  Pray  Love  were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever I wrote next because it would provide evidence that I still lived. So I knew that I had no way to win  and knowing that I had no way to win made me seriously consider for a while just quitting the game and moving to the country to raise corgis. But if I had done that  if I had given up writing  I would have lost my beloved vocation  so I knew that the task was that I had to find some way to gin up the inspiration to write the next book regardless of its inevitable negative outcome. In other words  I had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success. And I did  in the end  find that inspiration  but I found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place. I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life about how creativity can survive its own failure. So just to back up and explain  the only thing I have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer. I wrote all through childhood  all through adolescence  by the time I was a teenager I was sending my very bad stories to The New Yorker  hoping to be discovered. After college  I got a job as a diner waitress  kept working  kept writing  kept trying really hard to get published  and failing at it. I failed at getting published for almost six years. So for almost six years  every single day  I had nothing but rejection letters waiting for me in my mailbox. And it was devastating every single time  and every single time  I had to ask myself if I should just quit while I was behind and give up and spare myself this pain. But then I would find my resolve  and always in the same way  by saying   I'm not going to quit  I'm going home.  And you have to understand that for me  going home did not mean returning to my family's farm. For me  going home meant returning to the work of writing because writing was my home  because I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing  which is to say that I loved writing more than I loved my own ego  which is ultimately to say that I loved writing more than I loved myself. And that's how I pushed through it. But the weird thing is that    years later  during the crazy ride of  Eat  Pray  Love   I found myself identifying all over again with that unpublished young diner waitress who I used to be  thinking about her constantly  and feeling like I was her again  which made no rational sense whatsoever because our lives could not have been more different. She had failed constantly. I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation. We had nothing in common. Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again  And it was only when I was trying to unthread that that I finally began to comprehend the strange and unlikely psychological connection in our lives between the way we experience great failure and the way we experience great success. So think of it like this  For most of your life  you live out your existence here in the middle of the chain of human experience where everything is normal and reassuring and regular  but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here into the blinding darkness of disappointment. Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition and praise. And one of these fates is objectively seen by the world as bad  and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good  but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good. The only thing that it is capable of feeling is the absolute value of this emotional equation  the exact distance that you have been flung from yourself. And there's a real equal danger in both cases of getting lost out there in the hinterlands of the psyche. But in both cases  it turns out that there is also the same remedy for self restoration  and that is that you have got to find your way back home again as swiftly and smoothly as you can  and if you're wondering what your home is  here's a hint  Your home is whatever in this world you love more than you love yourself. So that might be creativity  it might be family  it might be invention  adventure  faith  service  it might be raising corgis  I don't know  your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential. For me  that home has always been writing. So after the weird  disorienting success that I went through with  Eat  Pray  Love   I realized that all I had to do was exactly the same thing that I used to have to do all the time when I was an equally disoriented failure. I had to get my ass back to work  and that's what I did  and that's how  in       I was able to publish the dreaded follow up to  Eat  Pray  Love.  And you know what happened with that book  It bombed  and I was fine. Actually  I kind of felt bulletproof  because I knew that I had broken the spell and I had found my way back home to writing for the sheer devotion of it. And I stayed in my home of writing after that  and I wrote another book that just came out last year and that one was really beautifully received  which is very nice  but not my point. My point is that I'm writing another one now  and I'll write another book after that and another and another and another and many of them will fail  and some of them might succeed  but I will always be safe from the random hurricanes of outcome as long as I never forget where I rightfully live. Look  I don't know where you rightfully live  but I know that there's something in this world that you love more than you love yourself. Something worthy  by the way  so addiction and infatuation don't count  because we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right  The only trick is that you've got to identify the best  worthiest thing that you love most  and then build your house right on top of it and don't budge from it. And if you should someday  somehow get vaulted out of your home by either great failure or great success  then your job is to fight your way back to that home the only way that it has ever been done  by putting your head down and performing with diligence and devotion and respect and reverence whatever the task is that love is calling forth from you next. You just do that  and keep doing that again and again and again  and I can absolutely promise you  from long personal experience in every direction  I can assure you that it's all going to be okay. Thank you.  Why    Why   is a question that parents ask me all the time.  Why did my child develop autism   As a pediatrician  as a geneticist  as a researcher  we try and address that question. But autism is not a single condition. It's actually a spectrum of disorders  a spectrum that ranges  for instance  from Justin  a    year old boy who's not verbal  who can't speak  who communicates by using an iPad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns  a little boy who  when he gets upset  will start rocking  and eventually  when he's disturbed enough  will bang his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and require stitches. That same diagnosis of autism  though  also applies to Gabriel  another    year old boy who has quite a different set of challenges. He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics. He can multiple three numbers by three numbers in his head with ease  yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation  he has great difficulty. He doesn't make eye contact. He has difficulty starting a conversation  feels awkward  and when he gets nervous  he actually shuts down. Yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. One of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autism. These days  one in    children will be diagnosed with autism  and the question is  why does this graph look this way  Has that number been increasing dramatically over time  Or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism  simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply didn't have that label  And in fact  in the late     s  the early     s  legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources  with access to educational materials that would help them. With that increased awareness  more parents  more pediatricians  more educators learned to recognize the features of autism. As a result of that  more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the resources they needed. In addition  we've changed our definition over time  so in fact we've widened the definition of autism  and that accounts for some of the increased prevalence that we see. The next question everyone wonders is  what caused autism  And a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism. But let me be very clear  Vaccines do not cause autism. In fact  the original research study that suggested that was the case was completely fraudulent. It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet  in which it was published  and that author  a physician  had his medical license taken away from him. The Institute of Medicine  The Centers for Disease Control  have repeatedly investigated this and there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism. Furthermore  one of the ingredients in vaccines  something called thimerosal  was thought to be what the cause of autism was. That was actually removed from vaccines in the year       and you can see that it really did not have an effect in what happened with the prevalence of autism. So again  there is no evidence that this is the answer. So the question remains  what does cause autism  In fact  there's probably not one single answer. Just as autism is a spectrum  there's a spectrum of etiologies  a spectrum of causes. Based on epidemiological data  we know that one of the causes  or one of the associations  I should say  is advanced paternal age  that is  increasing age of the father at the time of conception. In addition  another vulnerable and critical period in terms of development is when the mother is pregnant. During that period  while the fetal brain is developing  we know that exposure to certain agents can actually increase the risk of autism. In particular  there's a medication  valproic acid  which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take  we know can increase that risk of autism. In addition  there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism. And one of the things I'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism. I'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism  but it's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene. One of the genetic factors that we don't understand  however  is the difference that we see in terms of males and females. Males are affected four to one compared to females with autism  and we really don't understand what that cause is. One of the ways that we can understand that genetics is a factor is by looking at something called the concordance rate. In other words  if one sibling has autism  what's the probability that another sibling in that family will have autism  And we can look in particular at three types of siblings  identical twins  twins that actually share     percent of their genetic information and shared the same intrauterine environment  versus fraternal twins  twins that actually share    percent of their genetic information  versus regular siblings  brother sister  sister sister  also sharing    percent of their genetic information  yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment. And when you look at those concordance ratios  one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins  that concordance rate is    percent. Remarkably  though  it's not     percent. It is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism  but yet they account for a lot of that risk  because when you look at fraternal twins  that concordance rate is only    percent. On the other hand  there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings  suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone. So this provides some of the data that autism is genetic. Well  how genetic is it  When we compare it to other conditions that we're familiar with  things like cancer  heart disease  diabetes  in fact  genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions. But with this  that doesn't tell us what the genes are. It doesn't even tell us in any one child  is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes  And so in fact  in some individuals with autism  it is genetic  That is  that it is one single  powerful  deterministic gene that causes the autism. However  in other individuals  it's genetic  that is  that it's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism. We don't know in any one person  necessarily  which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper. So the question becomes  how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are. And let me pose something that might not be intuitive. In certain individuals  they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family. And the reason is because in certain individuals  they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father  but actually start brand new in them  mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family. And we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those individuals. So in fact  at the Simons Foundation  we took       individuals that had no family history of autism  and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases  To do that  we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother  the father and the child. In doing so  I apologize  I'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia  but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory  we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information. Our genetic information is organized into a set of    volumes  and when we did that  we had to be able to account for each of those    volumes  because in some cases with autism  there's actually a single volume that's missing. We had to get more granular than that  though  and so we had to start opening those books  and in some cases  the genetic change was more subtle. It might have been a single paragraph that was missing  or yet  even more subtle than that  a single letter  one out of three billion letters that was changed  that was altered  yet had profound effects in terms of how the brain functions and affects behavior. In doing this within these families  we were able to account for approximately    percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families. On the other hand  there's    percent that we still haven't figured out. As we did this  though  it was really quite humbling  because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism. In fact  the current estimates are that there are     to     different genes that can cause autism. And that explains  in part  why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects. Although there are that many genes  there is some method to the madness. It's not simply random          different genes  but in fact they fit together. They fit together in a pathway. They fit together in a network that's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions. We're starting to have a bottom up approach where we're identifying those genes  those proteins  those molecules  understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work  understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work  and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior  and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cognition. But early diagnosis is a key for us. Being able to make that diagnosis of someone who's susceptible at a time in a window where we have the ability to transform  to be able to impact that growing  developing brain is critical. And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods to be able to take infants  small babies  and be able to use biomarkers  in this case eye contact and eye tracking  to identify an infant at risk. This particular infant  you can see  making very good eye contact with this woman as she's singing  Itsy  Bitsy Spider   in fact is not going to develop autism. This baby we know is going to be in the clear. On the other hand  this other baby is going to go on to develop autism. In this particular child  you can see  it's not making good eye contact. Instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection  looking at the mouth  looking at the nose  looking off in another direction  but not again socially connecting  and being able to do this on a very large scale  screen infants  screen children for autism  through something very robust  very reliable  is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact. How are we going to intervene  It's probably going to be a combination of factors. In part  in some individuals  we're going to try and use medications. And so in fact  identifying the genes for autism is important for us to identify drug targets  to identify things that we might be able to impact and can be certain that that's really what we need to do in autism. But that's not going to be the only answer. Beyond just drugs  we're going to use educational strategies. Individuals with autism  some of them are wired a little bit differently. They learn in a different way. They absorb their surroundings in a different way  and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best. Beyond that  there are a lot of individuals in this room who have great ideas in terms of new technologies we can use  everything from devices we can use to train the brain to be able to make it more efficient and to compensate for areas in which it has a little bit of trouble  to even things like Google Glass. You could imagine  for instance  Gabriel  with his social awkwardness  might be able to wear Google Glass with an earpiece in his ear  and have a coach be able to help him  be able to help think about conversations  conversation starters  being able to even perhaps one day invite a girl out on a date. All of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism  but yet we have a long way to go. As much as we know  there is so much more that we don't know  and so I invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better  to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference  and in particular  for the individuals in families with autism  I invite you to join the interactive autism network  to be part of the solution to this  because it's going to take really a lot of us to think about what's important  what's going to be a meaningful difference. As we think about something that's potentially a solution  how well does it work  Is it something that's really going to make a difference in your lives  as an individual  as a family with autism  We're going to need individuals of all ages  from the young to the old  and with all different shapes and sizes of the autism spectrum disorder to make sure that we can have an impact. So I invite all of you to join the mission and to help to be able to make the lives of individuals with autism so much better and so much richer. Thank you. The Olympic motto is  Citius  Altius  Fortius.  Faster  Higher  Stronger. And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly. The winner of the      Olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes. Had he been racing against the winner of the      Olympic marathon  he would have won by nearly an hour and a half. Now we all have this feeling that we're somehow just getting better as a human race  inexorably progressing  but it's not like we've evolved into a new species in a century. So what's going on here  I want to take a look at what's really behind this march of athletic progress. In       Jesse Owens held the world record in the     meters. Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the     meters  when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished  Owens would have still had    feet to go. That's a lot in sprinter land. To give you a sense of how much it is  I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker. Now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the     meters  thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see Usain Bolt  the fastest man in history  flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks. And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race. Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race. Bang  The gun goes off. An American sprinter jumps out to the front. Usain Bolt starts to catch him. Usain Bolt passes him  and as the runners come to the finish  you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line. That's the entire finish of the race. You can open your eyes now. That first beep was Usain Bolt. That last beep was Jesse Owens. Listen to it again. When you think of it like that  it's not that big a difference  is it  And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible. Jesse Owens  on the other hand  ran on cinders  the ash from burnt wood  and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran. Rather than blocks  Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from. Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as Bolt  he wouldn't have been    feet behind  he would have been within one stride. Rather than the last beep  Owens would have been the second beep. Listen to it again. That's the difference track surface technology has made  and it's done it throughout the running world. Consider a longer event. In       Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile. Nowadays  college kids do that every year. On rare occasions  a high school kid does it. As of the end of last year        men had run under four minutes in the mile  but like Jesse Owens  Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today. So I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks  and their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower. So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub four mile on a synthetic track  this is what happens. Only     are left. If you look at it from that perspective  fewer than ten new men per  year  have joined the sub four mile club since Sir Roger Bannister. Now      is a lot more than one  and that's partly because there are many more people training today and they're training more intelligently. Even college kids are professional in their training compared to Sir Roger Bannister  who trained for    minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school. And that guy who won the      Olympic marathon in three in a half hours  that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while he ran along the course. That was his idea of a performance enhancing drug. Clearly  athletes have gotten more savvy about performance enhancing drugs as well  and that's made a difference in some sports at some times  but technology has made a difference in all sports  from faster skis to lighter shoes. Take a look at the record for the     meter freestyle swim. The record is always trending downward  but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs. This first cliff  in       is the introduction of the flip turn. Rather than stopping and turning around  athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction. This second cliff  the introduction of gutters on the side of the pool that allows water to splash off  rather than becoming turbulence that impedes the swimmers as they race. This final cliff  the introduction of full body and low friction swimsuits. Throughout sports  technology has changed the face of performance. In       Eddy Merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at    miles        feet. Now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until       when it was set at    miles        feet  nearly five miles farther than Eddy Merckx cycled in     . But then in       the International Cycling Union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that Eddy Merckx used in     . Where does the record stand today     miles        feet  a grand total of     feet farther than Eddy Merckx cycled more than four decades ago. Essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology. Still  technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward. While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century  the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed. In the early half of the   th century  physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors  medium height  medium weight  no matter the sport. And this showed in athletes' bodies. In the     s  the average elite high jumper and average elite shot putter were the same exact size. But as that idea started to fade away  as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type  you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches  a form of artificial selection took place  a self sorting for bodies that fit certain sports  and athletes' bodies became more different from one another. Today  rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper  the average elite shot putter is two and a half inches taller and     pounds heavier. And this happened throughout the sports world. In fact  if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the   th century  it looks like this. There's some dispersal  but it's kind of grouped around that average body type. Then that idea started to go away  and at the same time  digital technology    first radio  then television and the Internet    gave millions  or in some cases billions  of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance. The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed  and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance. It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies. And if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today  it looks like this. The athletes' bodies have gotten much more different from one another. And because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe  with the galaxies flying away from one another  the scientists who discovered it call it  The Big Bang of Body Types.  In sports where height is prized  like basketball  the tall athletes got taller. In       the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league  entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts. Suddenly  anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be  and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships. Almost overnight  the proportion of men in the NBA who are at least seven feet tall doubled to    percent. Today  one in    men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall  but a seven foot tall man is incredibly rare in the general population    so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of    and    who is at least seven feet tall  there's a    percent chance he's in the NBA right now. That is  find six honest seven footers  one is in the NBA right now. And that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique. This is Leonardo da Vinci's  Vitruvian Man   the ideal proportions  with arm span equal to height. My arm span is exactly equal to my height. Yours is probably very nearly so. But not the average NBA player. The average NBA player is a shade under  '    with arms that are seven feet long. Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall  they are ludicrously long. Had Leonardo wanted to draw the Vitruvian NBA Player  he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse  not a circle and a square. So in sports where large size is prized  the large athletes have gotten larger. Conversely  in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage  the small athletes got smaller. The average elite female gymnast shrunk from  '   to  '   on average over the last    years  all the better for their power to weight ratio and for spinning in the air. And while the large got larger and the small got smaller  the weird got weirder. The average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer  all the better for a forceful throwing whip. And as the large got larger  small got smaller  and the weird weirder. In swimming  the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs. It's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water. And the opposite is advantageous in running. You want long legs and a short torso. And this shows in athletes' bodies today. Here you see Michael Phelps  the greatest swimmer in history  standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj  the world record holder in the mile. These men are seven inches different in height  but because of the body types advantaged in their sports  they wear the same length pants. Seven inches difference in height  these men have the same length legs. Now in some cases  the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren't previously competing at all  like Kenyan distance runners. We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners. Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners. The Kalenjin make up just    percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners. And they happen  on average  to have a certain unique physiology  legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity  and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate  and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes. It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils  to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out  and because the leg is like a pendulum  the longer and thinner it is at the extremity  the more energy efficient it is to swing. To put Kalenjin running success in perspective  consider that    American men in history have run faster than two hours and    minutes in the marathon. That's a four minute and    second per mile pace. Thirty two Kalenjin men did that last October. That's from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta. Still  even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all of the changes in performance. Athletes have a different mindset than they once did. Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they're thrown across a room  There's no explosion there. What's happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once  and they're throwing themselves across the room. They're essentially jumping. That's the power that's contained in the human body. But normally we can't access nearly all of it. Our brain acts as a limiter  preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources  because we might hurt ourselves  tearing tendons or ligaments. But the more we learn about how that limiter functions  the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit  in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won't be in mortal danger by pushing harder. Endurance and ultra endurance sports serve as a great example. Ultra endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health  but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra endurance  no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running  narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames  large surface area of joints for shock absorption. We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring  short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs  and when we run  we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight. Our primate cousins can't do that. They have to run like this. And we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running. Have you ever looked at an ape's butt  They have no buns because they don't run upright. And as athletes have realized that we're perfectly suited for ultra endurance  they've taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before  athletes like Spanish endurance racer K lian Jornet. Here's K lian running up the Matterhorn. With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist. It's so steep he can't even run here. He's pulling up on a rope. This is a vertical ascent of more than       feet  and K lian went up and down in under three hours. Amazing. And talented though he is  K lian is not a physiological freak. Now that he has done this  other athletes will follow  just as other athletes followed after Sir Roger Bannister ran under four minutes in the mile. Changing technology  changing genes  and a changing mindset. Innovation in sports  whether that's new track surfaces or new swimming techniques  the democratization of sport  the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world  and imagination in sport  an understanding of what the human body is truly capable of  have conspired to make athletes stronger  faster  bolder  and better than ever. Thank you very much. There are    million people in the world who are blind. Eighty percent of them are living in low income countries such as Kenya  and the absolute majority do not need to be blind. They are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable. Knowing this  with my young family  we moved to Kenya. We secured equipment  funds  vehicles  we trained a team  we set up a hundred clinics throughout the Great Rift Valley to try and understand a single question  why are people going blind  and what can we do  The challenges were great. When we got to where we were going  we set up our high tech equipment. Power was rarely available. We'd have to run our equipment from petrol power generators. And then something occurred to me  There has to be an easier way  because it's the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it. More people in Kenya  and in sub Saharan Africa  have access to a mobile phone than they do clean running water. So we said  could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way  And so we developed Peek  a smartphone  system  that enables community healthcare workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere. We set about replacing traditional hospital equipment  which is bulky  expensive and fragile  with smartphone apps and hardware that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age. Here we have a demonstration of a three month old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker. We've got many trials going on in the community and in schools  and through the lessons that we've learned in the field  we've realized it's extremely important to share the data in non medical jargon so that people understand what we're examining and what that means to them. So here  for example  we use our sight sim application  once your vision has been measured  to show carers and teachers what the visual world is like for that person  so they can empathize with them and help them. Once we've discovered somebody has low vision  the next big challenge is to work out why  and to be able to do that  we need to have access to the inside of the eye. Traditionally  this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina. The retina is the single part of the eye that has huge amounts of information about the body and its health. We've developed  D printed  low cost hardware that comes in at less than five dollars to produce  which can then be clipped onto a smartphone and makes it possible to get views of the back of the eye of a very high quality. And the beauty is  anybody can do it. In our trials on over two and half thousand people  the smartphone with the add on clip is comparable to a camera that is hugely more expensive and hugely more difficult to transport. When we first moved to Kenya  we went with         dollars of equipment  a team of    people  and that was what was needed to deliver health care. Now  all that's needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone. And it costs just     dollars. The issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar. Our healthcare workers travel with a solar powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and backed up. Now we go to the patient rather than waiting for the patient never to come. We go to them in their homes and we give them the most comprehensive  high tech  accurate examination  which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training. We can link global experts with people in the most rural  difficult to reach places that are beyond the end of the road  effectively putting those experts in their homes  allowing us to make diagnoses and make plans for treatment. Project managers  hospital directors  are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in. Here in Nakuru  where I've been living  we can search for people by whatever condition. Here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract. Each red pin depicts somebody who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable  and they're locatable. We can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment. What's more  we've learned that this is something that we haven't built just for the community but with the community. Those blue pins that drop represent elders  or local leaders  that are connected to those people who can ensure that we can find them and arrange treatment. So for patients like Mama Wangari  who have been blind for over    years and never seen her grandchildren  for less than    dollars  we can restore her eyesight. This is something that has to happen. It's only in statistics that people go blind by the millions. The reality is everyone goes blind on their own. But now  they might just be a text message away from help. And now because live demos are always a bad idea  we're going to try a live demo. So here we have the Peek Vision app. Okay  and what we're looking at here  this is Sam's optic nerve  which is a direct extension of her brain  so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there. We can see all parts of the retina. It makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body that would not be possible without access to the eye  and that clip on device can be manufactured for just a few dollars  and people can be cured of blindness  and I think it says a lot about us as a human race if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them. But now we can. Thank you. We live in a very complex environment  complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs  from videos. You can even see it outside your window. It's endlessly complex  but somehow familiar  but the patterns kind of repeat  but they never repeat exactly. It's a huge challenge to understand. The patterns that you see are there at all of the different scales  but you can't chop it into one little bit and say   Oh  well let me just make a smaller climate.  I can't use the normal products of reductionism to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study in a laboratory and say   Oh  now that's something I now understand.  It's the whole or it's nothing. The different scales that give you these kinds of patterns range over an enormous range of magnitude  roughly    orders of magnitude  from the small microscopic particles that seed clouds to the size of the planet itself  from    to the minus six to    to the eight     orders of spatial magnitude. In time  from milliseconds to millennia  again around    orders of magnitude. What does that mean  Okay  well if you think about how you can calculate these things  you can take what you can see  okay  I'm going to chop it up into lots of little boxes  and that's the result of physics  right  And if I think about a weather model  that spans about five orders of magnitude  from the planet to a few kilometers  and the time scale from a few minutes to    days  maybe a month. We're interested in more than that. We're interested in the climate. That's years  that's millennia  and we need to go to even smaller scales. The stuff that we can't resolve  the sub scale processes  we need to approximate in some way. That is a huge challenge. Climate models in the     s took an even smaller chunk of that  only about three orders of magnitude. Climate models in the     s  kind of what we're working with now  four orders of magnitude. We have    to go  and we're increasing our capability of simulating those at about one extra order of magnitude every decade. One extra order of magnitude in space is        times more calculations. And we keep adding more things  more questions to these different models. So what does a climate model look like  This is an old climate model  admittedly  a punch card  a single line of Fortran code. We no longer use punch cards. We do still use Fortran. New fangled ideas like C really haven't had a big impact on the climate modeling community. But how do we go about doing it  How do we go from that complexity that you saw to a line of code  We do it one piece at a time. This is a picture of sea ice taken flying over the Arctic. We can look at all of the different equations that go into making the ice grow or melt or change shape. We can look at the fluxes. We can look at the rate at which snow turns to ice  and we can code that. We can encapsulate that in code. These models are around a million lines of code at this point  and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code every year. So you can look at that piece  but you can look at the other pieces too. What happens when you have clouds  What happens when clouds form  when they dissipate  when they rain out  That's another piece. What happens when we have radiation coming from the sun  going through the atmosphere  being absorbed and reflected  We can code each of those very small pieces as well. There are other pieces  the winds changing the ocean currents. We can talk about the role of vegetation in transporting water from the soils back into the atmosphere. And each of these different elements we can encapsulate and put into a system. Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole. And you get something like this. You get a beautiful representation of what's going on in the climate system  where each and every one of those emergent patterns that you can see  the swirls in the Southern Ocean  the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico  and there's two more that are going to pop up in the Pacific at any point now  those rivers of atmospheric water  all of those are emergent properties that come from the interactions of all of those small scale processes I mentioned. There's no code that says   Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean.  There's no code that says   Have two tropical cyclones that spin around each other.  All of those things are emergent properties. This is all very good. This is all great. But what we really want to know is what happens to these emergent properties when we kick the system  When something changes  what happens to those properties  And there's lots of different ways to kick the system. There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit over hundreds of thousands of years that change the climate. There are changes in the solar cycles  every    years and longer  that change the climate. Big volcanoes go off and change the climate. Changes in biomass burning  in smoke  in aerosol particles  all of those things change the climate. The ozone hole changed the climate. Deforestation changes the climate by changing the surface properties and how water is evaporated and moved around in the system. Contrails change the climate by creating clouds where there were none before  and of course greenhouse gases change the system. Each of these different kicks provides us with a target to evaluate whether we understand something about this system. So we can go to look at what model skill is. Now I use the word  skill  advisedly  Models are not right or wrong  they're always wrong. They're always approximations. The question you have to ask is whether a model tells you more information than you would have had otherwise. If it does  it's skillful. This is the impact of the ozone hole on sea level pressure  so low pressure  high pressures  around the southern oceans  around Antarctica. This is observed data. This is modeled data. There's a good match because we understand the physics that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere and what that does to the winds around the southern oceans. We can look at other examples. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in      put an enormous amount of aerosols  small particles  into the stratosphere. That changed the radiation balance of the whole planet. There was less energy coming in than there was before  so that cooled the planet  and those red lines and those green lines  those are the differences between what we expected and what actually happened. The models are skillful  not just in the global mean  but also in the regional patterns. I could go through a dozen more examples  the skill associated with solar cycles  changing the ozone in the stratosphere  the skill associated with orbital changes over       years. We can look at that too  and the models are skillful. The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets        years ago. The models are skillful when it comes to the   th century trends over the decades. Models are successful at modeling lake outbursts into the North Atlantic       years ago. And we can get a good match to the data. Each of these different targets  each of these different evaluations  leads us to add more scope to these models  and leads us to more and more complex situations that we can ask more and more interesting questions  like  how does dust from the Sahara  that you can see in the orange  interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic  How do organic aerosols from biomass burning  which you can see in the red dots  intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns  How does pollution  which you can see in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe  how does that affect the temperatures at the surface and the sunlight that you get at the surface  We can look at this across the world. We can look at the pollution from China. We can look at the impacts of storms on sea salt particles in the atmosphere. We can see the combination of all of these different things happening all at once  and we can ask much more interesting questions. How do air pollution and climate coexist  Can we change things that affect air pollution and climate at the same time  The answer is yes. So this is a history of the   th century. The first one is the model. The weather is a little bit different to what actually happened. The second one are the observations. And we're going through the     s. There's variability  there are things going on  but it's all kind of in the noise. As you get towards the     s  things are going to start to change. They're going to start to look more similar  and by the time you get to the     s  you're already seeing the patterns of global warming  both in the observations and in the model. We know what happened over the   th century. Right  We know that it's gotten warmer. We know where it's gotten warmer. And if you ask the models why did that happen  and you say  okay  well  yes  basically it's because of the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere. We have a very good match up until the present day. But there's one key reason why we look at models  and that's because of this phrase here. Because if we had observations of the future  we obviously would trust them more than models  But unfortunately  observations of the future are not available at this time. So when we go out into the future  there's a difference. The future is unknown  the future is uncertain  and there are choices. Here are the choices that we have. We can do some work to mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That's the top one. We can do more work to really bring it down so that by the end of the century  it's not much more than there is now. Or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business as usual type of attitude. The differences between these choices can't be answered by looking at models. There's a great phrase that Sherwood Rowland  who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry that led to ozone depletion  when he was accepting his Nobel Prize  he asked this question   What is the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if  in the end  all we're willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true   The models are skillful  but what we do with the information from those models is totally up to you. Thank you. First of all  for those of you who are not familiar with my work  I create multicultural characters  so characters from lots of different backgrounds. So before the present is the new future  a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family that was multi everything    multi racial  multi cultural  black and white  Caribbean  Irish American  German American. There was Dominican music blasting from stereos. There were Christians and Jews. That's a long story filled with intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame. But I was totally immersed in this world that was filled with everybody  and then I went on to the United Nations school  and that just completely   So I began sort of developing these voices and these people  all of whom were loosely based on people I really know  and so  for example  in performing them  I would really try to inhabit them. And for example  I don't really talk like that  but that was one of my people  and I'm going to bring a few of my friends    I think of them as my friends   to this stage  in this spirit of the idea that the present is the new future  in sort of a meta way  because I thought about it  and the future  for me  what can be so frightening is that I don't know what's coming. I don't know if that's true for other people  but that notion of thinking about how we can understand the future and predict outcomes  for me  it's terrifying to not know what might be coming. And so the idea that there are questions that I've never seen that my people are going to answer  and some of these characters have been with me for ages  some of them don't even have names  I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's coming  and all I can do is remind myself that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants  and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like that dream where you don't have any pants on  and so I suppose I'm going to be flying by the seat of my ass. That said  let's just see who comes out. May we have the first question   Do you ever get headaches from the microchips implanted in your brain   Right. Okay. Well first of all  I'll just say that I hope you can hear me okay. My name is Lorraine Levine  and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain  frankly  just putting on my glasses reminds me of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses. No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them  but at my age  just putting on the regular ones I have already gives me too much information. Do you understand what I'm saying to you  I don't need to know more. I don't want to know. That's it. That's enough. I love you all. You're wonderful. It's fabulous to be here with such big machers again this year. Mwah  Okay  next question.  Applause  Next  please.  Is dating boring  now that humans reproduce asexually   Who do we got  Hi  um  okay  hi everybody. My name is Nereida. I just want to say first of all that dating is never boring under any circumstance. But I am very excited to be here right now  so I am just trying to remind myself that  you know  like  the purpose of being here and everything  I mean  trying to answer these questions  it is very exciting. But I also  I just need to acknowledge that TED is an incredible experience right now in the present  like  I just need to say  like  Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende  Okay  maybe it doesn't mean  of course it means something to you  but to me  it's like  another level  okay  Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact that there are role models here that I can really  I don't know  I just need to say that. That's incredible to me  and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that  I just need to  like  say some affirmations that can help me. I usually just try to use  like  the three little words that always make me feel better  Sotomayor  Sotomayor  Sotomayor.  Laughter  Just  it really helps me to get grounded. Now I can use Allende  Allende  Allende  and  you know  I just need to say it  like  it's so incredible to be here  and I knew that we were going to have these questions. I was so nervous and I was thinking just  like  oh my God  oh my God  and reminding me  because I've had  like  some very  especially since the last time we were here at TED  it was  like  unbelievable  and then right after that  like  so many crazy things happened  like  we ended up going to the White House to perform. That was  like  amazing  and I'm standing there  and I was just like  please don't say   Oh my God.  Don't say   Oh my God.  And I just kept saying it   Oh my God. Oh my God.  And  you know  I kept thinking to myself  like  President Obama has to come up here at the same podium  and I'm standing here saying   Oh my God.  It's like  the separation of church and state. It's just  I couldn't  like  I couldn't process. It was really too much. So I think I've lost my way. But what I wanted to say is that dating  for me  you know  as far as I'm concerned  however you reproduce  as long as you're enjoying yourself and it's with another consenting asexual    I don't know. You know where I'm going with that. Okay  ciao  gracias. Okay  next question.  Applause  What are your top five favorite songs right now  All right  well first of all  I'mma say  you know what I'm saying  I'm the only dude up here right now. My name is Rashid  and I never been at TED before  you know what I'm saying. I think  Sarah Jones  maybe she didn't want me to come out last time. I don't know why. You know what I'm saying. Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED. You know what I'm saying. First of all  that I'm in hip hop  you know what I'm saying. I know some of y'all may be not really as much into the music  but the first way y'all can always know  you know what I'm saying  that I'm in hip hop  is 'cos I hold the microphone in an official emcee posture. Y'all can see that right there. That's how you hold it. All right  so you get your little tutorial right there. But when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here  I was like  betch  you know what I'm saying  TED is real fly  I got a whole lot of dope  you know what I'm saying  shit going on and everything  but she was like  yeah  we're going to have to answer  like  some random questions  just like  and I was like  what the hell is that  You know what I'm saying  just stand up there and answer some random questions  I don't want to  I mean  it's like an intellectual stop and frisk. You know what I'm saying   Laughter  I don't want to be standing up there just all getting interrogated and whatnot. That's what I'm trying to leave behind in New York. You know what I'm saying  So anyway  I would have to say my top five songs right now is all out of my own personal catalogue  you know what I mean  So if you want to know more about that  you know what I'm saying  we could talk about the anti piracy and all that  but as far as I'm concerned  you know  I believe in creative commons  and I think it's really important that  you know  that needs to be sustainable and everything  and I mean  as far as I'm concerned  I mean  this right here  this environment  I would like to sustain. You know what I mean  But I'm just saying  if y'all are interested in the top five songs  you need to holler at me. You know what I'm saying  Aight  In the future or the present. Yeah. Enjoy the rest of it. Okay  next question. What do you got   How many of your organs have been  D printed   Well I have to say that I don't know about how many of my organs have been   D printed as such  but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me  kind of thinking about this concept of the future and that  you know  all around the world parents are kind of telling their small children  please  you have to eat that  you know  I have slaved over a hot  D printer all day so that you can have this meal. You know  that kind of thing. And of course now that we have changed  you know  from the global South  there is this total kind of perspective shift that is happening around the    You can't just say to them  well  there are starving children. Well  it is the future. Nobody is starving anymore  thank God. But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism  and I do hope that we can continue to kind of  D print  well  let us just say I like to think that even in the future we will have the publication  kind of  you know  all the food that's fit to print. But everybody  please do enjoy that  and again  I think that you do throw a cracking good party here at TED. Thank you. Next question.  Applause  What has changed  Okay  it's like  I have to think about that.  What has changed now that women run the world   First of all  I really  like  I just want to say  and my name is Bella  I just want to  like  identify myself  that  like  as a feminist  I  like  I really find that  like  because I was born in the '  s  and  like  there were a lot of women who were as far as feminism was concerned  like  maybe they didn't understand that  like  a feminist like me  like  I don't think it's required that you have to have a certain kind of voice  or  like  a certain way of presenting yourself to be feminist  because I think that  like  feminism can be really hot  and I think actually that it's really vital and important. Like  the quotation I'm wearing is from  like  Gloria Steinem  and  like  I'm named Bella for  like  Bella Abzug  who's  like  obviously  like  a really important feminist from  like  history  and like  I just think that those women  like  really represent  like  that you can  like  be vital and  like  amazing  like  a mazing  and you don't have to wear  like  an Eileen Fisher caftan  just to  like  prove that you are a feminist. Like  not that there's anything wrong with that  but my mom  she's like  like  why do you have to wear pants that  like  objectify your body  I like my pants. Like  I like my voice. Like  she's like  why do you have to talk like   Talk like what  Like  I'm expressing myself  and I think that we have to  like  reach out  like  not only across  like  the different generations of feminists  but also across the  like  vocal ranges  so that  like  we  because otherwise it's just  like  restriculous within feminism  which is just  like  a word that I created that means  like  so strict it's ridiculous. So that's my feeling about that. You guys are a mazing  by the way. Okay. Next question.   They've discovered a cure for cancer  but not baldness  What's up with that    Yeah  you know what  so my name is Joseph Mancuso. First of all  I just want to say that I appreciate that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd  a pretty orderly group. And  you know  I just have to say  the whole thing with baldness  and  you know  here's the thing. As long as the woman  in my case    because it's a modern world  do whatever you want to do  I don't have any problem with anybody  enjoy yourself  LGBTQLMNOP. All right  But as far as I'm concerned  attractiveness  women don't really care as much as you think they do about the  you know. I mean  I remember hearing this woman. She loved her husband  it was the sweetest thing. It's a pretty young girl  you know  And this guy's older. And  you know  she said she would love him even if he had snow on the roof or even if melted and disappeared altogether. As far as I'm concerned  it's about the love. Am I right  or am I right  So that's it. That's it. That's it. I don't got nothing more to say. Keep your noses clean. All right  next question.  Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown   Um  well  I  I want to start by saying that this is a very difficult experience for a Chinese American. I don't know what to call myself now  because I have really my Chinese identity  but my kids  they are American Chinese  but it's difficult to try to express myself in front of audience of people like this. But if had to give my opinion about meat  I think first  the most important thing is to say that we don't have to have perfect food  but maybe it can also not be poison. Maybe we can have some middle ground for that. But I will continue to consider this idea  and I will report back maybe next year. Next. Next. Next.  Applause   Will there ever be a post racial world   Thank you for having me. My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that. I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation. I'm also half Lakota  but that is my given name  and no  even though it would have seemed like an obvious choice  no  I did not go into politics. Tough crowd. But I always like to just let people know when they ask about race or those kinds of things  you know  as a member of the First Nations community  you know  I'm probably not your typical guy. For example  in addition to being an activist  I'm also a professional stand up comedian. And  you know  I'm most popular on college and university campuses. You know  whenever they want to do a diversity day  or hey we're not all white week  then I'm there.  Laughter  Do I think there will ever be a post racial world  I think  really  I can't talk about race without remembering that it is a construct in certain respects  but also that  you know  until we redress the wrongs of the past  we're going to be turned around. I don't care if the present is the new future. I think there's a lot of great people here at TED who are working to address that  so with that  if anything I've said today makes you feel uncomfortable  you're welcome. I think we have time for one more.  What's the most popular diet these days   Who's here  Okay  well  I'm just gonna answer this really fast  as  like  three or four different people. I mean really fast. I'm just gonna let y'all know that  as far as diet is concerned  if you don't love yourself inside  there is no diet on this Earth that is going to make your behind small enough for you to feel good  so just stop wasting your time. I would just like to say as an African woman that I believe the diet that we need is really to remove the crazy belief that there is anything wrong with a nice backside. No  I am teasing about that. There is nothing wrong with a woman of size. That is what I am trying to say. Women  celebrate your body  for God's sake. Stop running around starving. You are making yourselves and other people miserable. Last answer. So we're talking about what's the most popular diet  I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that this is my first time here at TED. I might not be your typical person you find on this stage. My dental work not as nice as some people. But I made Sarah Jones promise she gonna bring me this time  'cause she didn't bring me before  but you know  I just want to say  there's a lot of things more important than counting calories  and as somebody living on the streets in New York  and getting to come here  hear y'all ideas worth spreading  I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea that the present is the new future  that where you sit  you create everything that's gonna come  for better or worse. And for me  I think homeless is the wrong word for it anyway. You know  I might not have me no place to lay my head at night  but that just makes me houseless. I have me a home. You do too. Find it and try to find yourself in there. Make sure you know  it's not just about virtual reality in space. That's wonderful  but it's also about the actual reality here on Earth. How are people living today  How can you be part of the solution  Thank y'all for thinking about that right now in the present moment to influence the future. I appreciate it. Bye bye. Thank you all very  very much. Thank you for trusting me  Chris. When I was a young officer  they told me to follow my instincts  to go with my gut  and what I've learned is that often our instincts are wrong. In the summer of       there was a massive leak of classified documents that came out of the Pentagon. It shocked the world  it shook up the American government  and it made people ask a lot of questions  because the sheer amount of information that was let out  and the potential impacts  were significant. And one of the first questions we asked ourselves was why would a young soldier have access to that much information  Why would we let sensitive things be with a relatively young person  In the summer of       I was assigned to command a special operations task force  and that task force was spread across the Mideast to fight al Qaeda. Our main effort was inside Iraq  and our specified mission was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq. For almost five years I stayed there  and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional and it was difficult and it was bloody and it often claimed its highest price among innocent people. We did everything we could to stop al Qaeda and the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers and as accelerants to the violence. We honed our combat skills  we developed new equipment  we parachuted  we helicoptered  we took small boats  we drove  and we walked to objectives night after night to stop the killing that this network was putting forward. We bled  we died  and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the Iraqi people. Now  we did what we knew  how we had grown up  and one of the things that we knew  that was in our DNA  was secrecy. It was security. It was protecting information. It was the idea that information was the lifeblood and it was what would protect and keep people safe. And we had a sense that  as we operated within our organizations  it was important to keep information in the silos within the organizations  particularly only give information to people had a demonstrated need to know. But the question often came  who needed to know  Who needed  who had to have the information so that they could do the important  parts of the job that you needed  And in a tightly coupled world  that's very hard to predict. It's very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn't. I used to deal with intelligence agencies  and I'd complain that they weren't sharing enough intelligence  and with a straight face  they'd look at me and they'd say   What aren't you getting    Laughter  I said   If I knew that  we wouldn't have a problem.  But what we found is we had to change. We had to change our culture about information. We had to knock down walls. We had to share. We had to change from who needs to know to the fact that who doesn't know  and we need to tell  and tell them as quickly as we can. It was a significant culture shift for an organization that had secrecy in its DNA. We started by doing things  by building  not working in offices  knocking down walls  working in things we called situation awareness rooms  and in the summer of       something happened which demonstrated this. We captured the personnel records for the people who were bringing foreign fighters into Iraq. And when we got the personnel records  typically  we would have hidden these  shared them with a few intelligence agencies  and then try to operate with them. But as I was talking to my intelligence officer  I said   What do we do   And he said   Well  you found them.  Our command.  You can just declassify them.  And I said   Well  can we declassify them  What if the enemy finds out   And he says   They're their personnel records.  So we did  and a lot of people got upset about that  but as we passed that information around  suddenly you find that information is only of value if you give it to people who have the ability to do something with it. The fact that I know something has zero value if I'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it. So as a consequence  what we did was we changed the idea of information  instead of knowledge is power  to one where sharing is power. It was the fundamental shift  not new tactics  not new weapons  not new anything else. It was the idea that we were now part of a team in which information became the essential link between us  not a block between us. And I want everybody to take a deep breath and let it out  because in your life  there's going to be information that leaks out you're not going to like. Somebody's going to get my college grades out  a that's going to be a disaster.  Laughter  But it's going to be okay  and I will tell you that I am more scared of the bureaucrat that holds information in a desk drawer or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks  because ultimately  we'll be better off if we share. Thank you. Helen Walters  So I don't know if you were here this morning  if you were able to catch Rick Ledgett  the deputy director of the NSA who was responding to Edward Snowden's talk earlier this week. I just wonder  do you think the American government should give Edward Snowden amnesty  Stanley McChrystal  I think that Rick said something very important. We  most people  don't know all the facts. I think there are two parts of this. Edward Snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand. He also took a lot of documents that he didn't have the knowledge to know the importance of  so I think we need to learn the facts about this case before we make snap judgments about Edward Snowden. HW  Thank you so much. Thank you. So  I have a feature on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer  and I try to answer them using math  science and comics. So for example  one person asked  what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at    percent of the speed of light  So I did some calculations. Now  normally  when an object flies through the air  the air will flow around the object  but in this case  the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn't have time to move out of the way. The ball would smash right into and through them  and the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen  carbon and hydrogen from the ball  fragmenting it off into tiny particles  and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it. This would result in a flood of x rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles  plasma inside  centered on the pitcher's mound  and that would move away from the pitcher's mound slightly faster than the ball. Now at this point  about    nanoseconds in  the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it  which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong. Now  after    nanoseconds  the ball will reach home plate  or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball  and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all as it also starts to carry them backward through the backstop  which also starts to disintegrate. So if you were watching this whole thing from a hill  ideally  far away  what you'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds  followed by a blast wave spreading out  shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium  and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city.  Laughter  So the Major League Baseball rules are a little bit hazy  but    Laughter    under rule  .   and  .    I think that in this situation  the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base  if it still existed. So this is the kind of question I answer  and I get people writing in with a lot of other strange questions. I've had someone write and say  scientifically speaking  what is the best and fastest way to hide a body  Can you do this one soon  And I had someone write in  I've had people write in about  can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart's broken  And I've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they're trying to get me to do for them. But one week  a couple months ago  I got a question that was actually about Google. If all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards  how big would Google's data warehouse be  Now  Google's pretty secretive about their operations  so no one really knows how much data Google has  and in fact  no one really knows how many data centers Google has  except people at Google itself. And I've tried  I've met them a few times  tried asking them  and they aren't revealing anything. So I decided to try to figure this out myself. There are a few things that I looked at here. I started with money. Google has to reveal how much they spend  in general  and that lets you put some caps on how many data centers could they be building  because a big data center costs a certain amount of money. And you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up  which turns out  it's pretty sizable. I read a calculation at one point  I think Google has a drive failure about every minute or two  and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one. So they go through a huge number of them. And so by looking at money  you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have. You can also look at power. You can look at how much electricity they need  because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers  and Google is more efficient than most  but they still have some basic requirements  and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have. You can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know  how big are they  How much room is that  How many server racks could you fit in there  And for some data centers  you might get two of these pieces of information. You know how much they spent  and they also  say  because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided  you might know what they made a deal to buy  so you know how much power it takes. Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers  and figure out for a data center where you don't have that information  you can figure out  but maybe you only have one of those  you know the square footage  then you could figure out well  maybe the power is proportional. And you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities  you know  with guesses about the total amount of storage  the number of servers  the number of drives per server  and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don't know. It's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get. And this is a lot of fun. The math is not all that advanced  and really it's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle. So what I did  I went through all of this information  spent a day or two researching. And there are some things I didn't look at. You could always look at the Google recruitment messages that they post. That gives you an idea of where they have people. Sometimes  when people visit a data center  they'll take a cell cam photo and post it  and they aren't supposed to  but you can learn things about their hardware that way. And in fact  you can just look at pizza delivery drivers. Turns out  they know where all the Google data centers are  at least the ones that have people in them. But I came up with my estimate  which I felt pretty good about  that was about    exabytes of data across all of Google's operations  and then another maybe five exabytes or so of offline storage in tape drives  which it turns out Google is about the world's largest consumer of. So I came up with this estimate  and this is a staggering amount of data. It's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has  as far as we know. There's a couple of other contenders  especially everyone always thinks of the NSA. But using some of these same methods  we can look at the NSA's data centers  and figure out  you know  we don't know what's going on there  but it's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of Google's. Adding all of this up  I came up with the other thing that we can answer  which is  how many punch cards would this take  And so a punch card can hold about    characters  and you can fit about       or so cards into a box  and you put them in  say  my home region of New England  it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers  which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about        years ago. So this is impractical  but I think that's about the best answer I could come up with. And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up. And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google  because of course they've been so secretive  they didn't answer of my questions  and so I just put it up and said  well  I guess we'll never know. But then a little while later I got a message  a couple weeks later  from Google  saying  hey  someone here has an envelope for you. So I go and get it  open it up  and it's punch cards.  Laughter  Google branded punch cards. And on these punch cards  there are a bunch of holes  and I said  thank you  thank you  okay  so what's on here  So I get some software and start reading it  and scan them  and it turns out it's a puzzle. There's a bunch of code  and I get some friends to help  and we crack the code  and then inside that is another code  and then there are some equations  and then we solve those equations  and then finally out pops a message from Google which is their official answer to my article  and it said   No comment.  And I love calculating these kinds of things  and it's not that I love doing the math. I do a lot of math  but I don't really like math for its own sake. What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know  and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper  find out something that you didn't know that's very surprising. And I have a lot of stupid questions  and I love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes. And sometimes not. This is a question I got from a reader  an anonymous reader  and the subject line just said   Urgent   and this was the entire email   If people had wheels and could fly  how would we differentiate them from airplanes   Urgent.  Laughter  And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer. Thank you. I'm assuming everyone here has watched a TED Talk online at one time or another  right  So what I'm going to do is play this. This is the song from the TED Talks online. And I'm going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they're slower. Ken Robinson  Good morning. How are you  Mark Applebaum  I'm going to    Kate Stone     mix some music.

TM  We all love music a great deal. MTT  Anthems  dance crazes  ballads and marches. Kirby Ferguson and JT  The remix  It  is new music created from old music. Ryan Holladay  Blend seamlessly. Kathryn Schulz  And that's how it goes. MTT  What happens when the music stops  KS  Yay  MR  Obviously  I've been watching a lot of TED Talks. When I was first asked to speak at TED  I wasn't quite sure what my angle was  at first  so yeah  I immediately started watching tons of TED Talks  which is pretty much absolutely the worst thing that you can do because you start to go into panic mode  thinking  I haven't mounted a successful expedition to the North Pole yet. Neither have I provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity. In fact  I've pretty much wasted most of my life DJing in night clubs and producing pop records. But I still kept watching the videos  because I'm a masochist  and eventually  things like Michael Tilson Thomas and Tod Machover  and seeing their visceral passion talking about music  it definitely stirred something in me  and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly about the power of music. And I started to write down on these little note cards every time I heard something that struck a chord in me  pardon the pun  or something that I thought I could use  and pretty soon  my studio looked like this  kind of like a John Nash   Beautiful Mind  vibe. The other good thing about watching TED Talks  when you see a really good one  you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend  don't you  Like  just for a day. They seem like a nice person. You'd take a bike ride  maybe share an ice cream. You'd certainly learn a lot. And every now and then they'd chide you  when they got frustrated that you couldn't really keep up with half of the technical things they're banging on about all the time. But then they'd remember that you're but a mere human of ordinary  mortal intelligence that didn't finish university  and they'd kind of forgive you  and pet you like the dog. Man  yeah  back to the real world  probably Sir Ken Robinson and I are not going to end up being best of friends. He lives all the way in L.A. and I imagine is quite busy  but through the tools available to me    technology and the innate way that I approach making music    I can sort of bully our existences into a shared event  which is sort of what you saw. I can hear something that I love in a piece of media and I can co opt it and insert myself in that narrative  or alter it  even. In a nutshell  that's what I was trying to do with these things  but more importantly  that's what the past    years of music has been. That's the major thread. See     years ago  you had the first digital samplers  and they changed everything overnight. All of a sudden  artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them  from a snare drum from the Funky Meters  to a Ron Carter bassline  the theme to  The Price Is Right.  Albums like De La Soul's    Feet High and Rising  and the Beastie Boys'  Paul's Boutique  looted from decades of recorded music to create these sonic  layered masterpieces that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day. And they weren't sampling these records because they were too lazy to write their own music. They weren't sampling these records to cash in on the familiarity of the original stuff. To be honest  it was all about sampling really obscure things  except for a few obvious exceptions like Vanilla Ice and  doo doo doo da da doo doo  that we know about. But the thing is  they were sampling those records because they heard something in that music that spoke to them that they instantly wanted to inject themselves into the narrative of that music. They heard it  they wanted to be a part of it  and all of a sudden they found themselves in possession of the technology to do so  not much unlike the way the Delta blues struck a chord with the Stones and the Beatles and Clapton  and they felt the need to co opt that music for the tools of their day. You know  in music we take something that we love and we build on it. I'd like to play a song for you. That's  La Di Da Di  and it's the fifth most sampled song of all time. It's been sampled     times. It was made in      by these two legends of hip hop  Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh  and the Ray Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong. I do hope that comes back soon. Anyway  this predated the sampling era. There were no samples in this record  although I did look up on the Internet last night  I mean several months ago  that  La Di Da Di  means  it's an old Cockney expression from the late     s in England  so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore from  Downton Abbey  coming soon  or that's for another day. Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box. Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record  and because of Slick Rick's sing songy  super catchy vocals  it provides endless sound bites and samples for future pop records. That was     . This is me in       in case you were wondering how I was doing  thank you for asking. It's Throwback Thursday already. I was involved in a heavy love affair with the music of Duran Duran  as you can probably tell from my outfit. I was in the middle. And the simplest way that I knew how to co opt myself into that experience of wanting to be in that song somehow was to just get a band together of fellow nine year olds and play  Wild Boys  at the school talent show. So that's what we did  and long story short  we were booed off the stage  and if you ever have a chance to live your life escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium full of second  and third graders booing  I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun. But it didn't really matter  because what I wanted somehow was to just be in the history of that song for a minute. I didn't care who liked it. I just loved it  and I thought I could put myself in there. Over the next    years   La Di Da Di  continues to be sampled by countless records  ending up on massive hits like  Here Comes the Hotstepper  and  I Wanna Sex You Up.  Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song on his debut album  Doggystyle  and calls it  Lodi Dodi.  Copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point. And then you fast forward to       and the Notorious B.I.G.  or Biggie  reinterprets  La Di Da Di  on his number one hit called  Hypnotize   which I will play a little bit of and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick to show you where they got it from. So Biggie was killed weeks before that song made it to number one  in one of the great tragedies of the hip hop era  but he would have been    years old and very much alive when  La Di Da Di  first came out  and as a young boy growing up in Brooklyn  it's hard not to think that that song probably held some fond memories for him. But the way he interpreted it  as you hear  is completely his own. He flips it  makes it  there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it. It's thoroughly modern Biggie. I had to make that joke in this room  because you would be the only people that I'd ever have a chance of getting it. And so  it's a groaner.  Laughter  Elsewhere in the pop and rap world  we're going a little bit sample crazy. We're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing  and all of a sudden everyone's taking these massive '  s tunes like Bowie   Let's Dance   and all these disco records  and just rapping on them. These records don't really age that well. You don't hear them now  because they borrowed from an era that was too steeped in its own connotation. You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale. It leaves the listener feeling sickly. You have to take an element of those things and then bring something fresh and new to it  which was something that I learned when I was working with the late  amazing Amy Winehouse on her album  Back to Black.  A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi  the other producer  achieved  how we captured this long lost sound  but without the very  very   st century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore and even a mention of Slick Rick  the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche  to be honest. Imagine any other singer from that era over it singing the same old lyrics. It runs a risk of being completely bland. I mean  there was no doubt that Amy and I and Salaam all had this love for this gospel  soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangements. She brought the ingredients that made it urgent and of the time. So if we come all the way up to the present day now  the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus  she reinterprets  La Di Da Di  completely for her generation  and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part and then see how she sort of flipped it. So Miley Cyrus  who wasn't even born yet when  La Di Da Di  was made  and neither were any of the co writers on the song  has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music  and now  with its timeless playfulness of the original  has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co opt it as their own. Since the dawn of the sampling era  there's been endless debate about the validity of music that contains samples. You know  the Grammy committee says that if your song contains some kind of pre written or pre existing music  you're ineligible for song of the year. Rockists  who are racist but only about rock music  constantly use the argument to   That's a real word. That is a real word. They constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop  and these arguments completely miss the point  because the dam has burst. We live in the post sampling era. We take the things that we love and we build on them. That's just how it goes. And when we really add something significant and original and we merge our musical journey with this  then we have a chance to be a part of the evolution of that music that we love and be linked with it once it becomes something new again. So I would like to do one more piece that I put together for you tonight  and it takes place with two pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen. One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini  who happens to be a blind  autistic genius at the piano  and Emmanuel Jal  who is an ex child soldier from the South Sudan  who is a spoken word poet and rapper. And once again I found a way to annoyingly me me me myself into the musical history of these songs  but I can't help it  because they're these things that I love  and I want to mess around with them. So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go. Let's hear that TED sound again  right  Thank you very much. Thank you. So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank  and it's clear that the general public needs guidance  because the average bank robbery nets only       dollars. Rank amateurs who know nothing about how to cook the books. The folks who know  of course  run our largest banks  and in the last go around  they cost us over    trillion dollars. That's what    trillion looks like. That's how many zeros  And cost us over    million jobs as well. So our task is to educate ourselves so that we can understand why we have these recurrent  intensifying financial crises  and how we can prevent them in the future. And the answer to that is that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud. Control fraud is what happens when the people who control  typically a CEO  a seemingly legitimate entity  use it as a weapon to defraud. And these are the weapons of mass destruction in the financial world. They also follow in finance a particular strategy  because the weapon of choice in finance is accounting  and there is a recipe for accounting control fraud  and how it occurs. And we discovered this recipe in quite an odd way that I'll come back to in a moment. First ingredient in the recipe  grow like crazy  second  by making or buying really crappy loans  but loans that are made at a very high interest rate or yield  three  while employing extreme leverage    that just means a lot of debt    compared to your equity  and four  while providing only trivial loss reserves against the inevitable losses. If you follow those four simple steps  and any bank can follow them  then you are mathematically guaranteed to have three things occur. The first thing is you will report record bank profits    not just high  record. Two  the CEO will immediately be made incredibly wealthy by modern executive compensation. And three  farther down the road  the bank will suffer catastrophic losses and will fail unless it is bailed out. And that's a hint as to how we discovered this recipe  because we discovered it through an autopsy process. During the savings and loan debacle in       we looked at every single failure  and we looked for common characteristics  and we discovered this recipe was common to each of these frauds. In other words  a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe that will destroy the banks as well as the economy. And it also turns out to be precisely what could have stopped this crisis  the one that cost us    trillion dollars just in the household sector  that cost us    million jobs  was the easiest financial crisis by far to have avoided completely if we had simply learned the lessons of epidemics of control fraud  particularly using this recipe. So let's go to this crisis  and the two huge epidemics of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis    appraisal fraud and liar's loans    and what we're going to see in looking at both of these is we got warnings that were incredibly early about these frauds. We got warnings that we could have taken advantage of easily  because back in the savings and loan debacle  we had figured out how to respond and prevent these crises. And three  the warnings were unambiguous. They were obvious that what was going on was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up. Let's take appraisal fraud first. This is simply where you inflate the value of the home that is being pledged as security for the loan. In       the year       that is over a year before Enron fails  by the way  the honest appraisers got together a formal petition begging the federal government to act  and the industry to act  to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud. And the appraisers explained how it was occurring  that banks were demanding that appraisers inflate the appraisal  and that if the appraisers refused to do so  they  the banks  would blacklist honest appraisers and refuse to use them. Now  we've seen this before in the savings and loan debacle  and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders  and that no honest lender would ever inflate the appraisal  because it's the great protection against loss. So this was an incredibly early warning      . It was something we'd seen before  and it was completely unambiguous. This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud led by the banks. What about liar's loans  Well  that warning actually comes earlier. The savings and loan debacle is basically the early     s through       and in the midst of fighting that wave of accounting control fraud  in       we found that a second front of fraud was being started. And like all good financial frauds in America  it began in Orange County  California. And we happened to be the regional regulators for it. And our examiners said  they are making loans without even checking what the borrower's income is. This is insane  it has to lead to massive losses  and it only makes sense for entities engaged in these accounting control frauds. And we said  yeah  you're absolutely right  and we drove those liar's loans out of the industry in      and       but we could only deal with the industry we had jurisdiction over  which was savings and loans  and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds  Long Beach Savings  voluntarily gave up its federal savings and loan charter  gave up federal deposit insurance  converted to become a mortgage bank for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction  and changed its name to Ameriquest  and became the most notorious of the liar's loans frauds early on  and to add to that  they deliberately predated upon minorities. So we knew again about this crisis. We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before. We had incredibly early warnings of it  and it was absolutely unambiguous that no honest lender would make loans in this fashion. So let's take a look at the reaction of the industry and the regulators and the prosecutors to these clear early warnings that could have prevented the crisis. Start with the industry. The industry responded between      and      by increasing liar's loans by over     percent. These were the loans that hyperinflated the bubble and produced the economic crisis. By       half of all the loans called subprime were also liar's loans. They're not mutually exclusive  it's just that together  they're the most toxic combination you can possibly imagine. By          percent of all the loans made that year  all the home loans made that year  were liar's loans     percent. And this is despite a warning from the industry's own antifraud experts that said that these loans were an open invitation to fraudsters  and that they had a fraud incidence of    percent  nine zero. In response to that  the industry first started calling these loans liar's loans  which lacks a certain subtlety  and second  massively increased them  and no government regulator ever required or encouraged any lender to make a liar's loan or anyone to purchase a liar's loan  and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie. This came from the lenders because of the fraud recipe. What happened to appraisal fraud  It expanded remarkably as well. By       when a survey of appraisers was done     percent of appraisers reported that they had been subject to coercion from the lenders trying to get them to inflate an appraisal. In other words  both forms of fraud became absolutely endemic and normal  and this is what drove the bubble. What happened in the governmental sector  Well  the government  as I told you  when we were the savings and loan regulators  we could only deal with our industry  and if people gave up their federal deposit insurance  we couldn't do anything to them. Congress  it may strike you as impossible  but actually did something intelligent in       and passed the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act that gave the Fed  and only the Federal Reserve  the explicit  statutory authority to ban liar's loans by every lender  whether or not they had federal deposit insurance. So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan  as chairs of the Fed  do when they got these warnings that these were massively fraudulent loans and that they were being sold to the secondary market  Remember  there's no fraud exorcist. Once it starts out a fraudulent loan  it can only be sold to the secondary market through more frauds  lying about the reps and warrantees  and then those people are going to produce mortgage backed securities and exotic derivatives which are also going to be supposedly backed by those fraudulent loans. So the fraud is going to progress through the entire system  hyperinflate the bubble  produce a disaster. And remember  we had experience with this. We had seen significant losses  and we had experience of competent regulators in stopping it. Greenspan and Bernanke refused to use the authority under the statute to stop liar's loans. And this was a matter first of dogma. They're just horrifically opposed to anything regulatory. But it is also the international competition in laxity  the race to the bottom between the United States and the United Kingdom  the city of London  in particular  and the city of London won that race to the bottom  but it meant that all regulation in the West was completely degraded in this stupid competition to be who could have the weakest regulation. So that was the regulatory response. What about the response of the prosecutors after the crisis  after    trillion dollars in losses  after    million jobs lost  a crisis in which the losses and the frauds were more than    times larger than the savings and loan debacle  Well  in the savings and loan debacle  our agency that regulated savings and loans  OTS  made over        criminal referrals  produced over       felony convictions just in cases designated as major  and that understates the degree of prioritization  because we worked with the FBI to create the list of the top     fraud schemes  the absolute worst of the worst  nationwide. Roughly     savings and loans involved  roughly     senior officials. Virtually all of them were prosecuted. We had a    percent conviction rate. It's the greatest success against elite white collar criminals ever  and it was because of this understanding of control fraud and the accounting control fraud mechanism. Flash forward to the current crisis. The same agency  Office of Thrift Supervision  which was supposed to regulate many of the largest makers of liar's loans in the country  has made  even today    it no longer exists  but as of a year ago  it had made zero criminal referrals. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks  has made zero criminal referrals. The Fed appears to have made zero criminal referrals. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is smart enough to refuse to answer the question. Without any guidance from the regulators  there's no expertise in the FBI to investigate complex frauds. It isn't simply that they've had to reinvent the wheel of how to do these prosecutions  they've forgotten that the wheel exists  and therefore  we have zero prosecutions  and of course  zero convictions  of any of the elite bank frauds  the Wall Street types  that drove this crisis. With no expertise coming from the regulators  the FBI formed what it calls a partnership with the Mortgage Bankers Association in     . The Mortgage Bankers Association is the trade association of the perps. And the Mortgage Bankers Association set out  it had the audacity and the success to con the FBI. It had created a supposed definition of mortgage fraud  in which  guess what  its members are always the victim and never the perpetrators. And the FBI has bought this hook  line  sinker  rod  reel and the boat they rode out in. And so the FBI  under the leadership of an attorney general who is African American and a president of the United States who is African American  have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis  in which it is the first virgin crisis in history  conceived without sin in the executive ranks. And it's those oh so clever hairdressers who were able to defraud the poor  pitiful banks  who lack any financial sophistication. It is the silliest story you can conceive of  and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers  and they leave the banksters alone entirely. And so  while lions are roaming the campsite  the FBI is chasing mice. What do we need to do  What can we do in all of this  We need to change the perverse incentive structures that produce these recurrent epidemics of accounting control fraud that are driving our crises. So we have to first get rid of the systemically dangerous institutions. These are the so called too big to fail institutions. We need to shrink them to the point  within the next five years  that they no longer pose a systemic risk. Right now  they are ticking time bombs that will cause a global crisis as soon as the next one fails    not if  when. Second thing we need to do is completely reform modern executive and professional compensation  which is what they use to suborn the appraisers. Remember  they were pressuring the appraisers through the compensation system  trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic  in which bad ethics drives good ethics out of the marketplace. And they largely succeeded  which is how the fraud became endemic. And the third thing that we need to do is deal with what we call the three D's  deregulation  desupervision  and the de facto decriminalization. Because we can make all three of these changes  and if we do so  we can dramatically reduce how often we have a crisis and how severe those crises are. That is not simply critical to our economy. You can see what these crises do to inequality and what they do to our democracy. They have produced crony capitalism  American style  in which the largest financial institutions are the leading financial donors of both parties  and that's the reason why even after this crisis     times larger than the savings and loan crisis  we have no meaningful reforms in any of the three areas that I've talked about  other than banning liar's loans  which is good  but that's just one form of ammunition for this fraud weapon. There are many forms of ammunition they can use. That's why we need to learn what the bankers have learned  the recipe for the best way to rob a bank  so that we can stop that recipe  because our legislators  who are dependent on political contributions  will not do it on their own. Thank you very much. I study ants in the desert  in the tropical forest and in my kitchen  and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live. I've recently realized that ants are using interactions differently in different environments  and that got me thinking that we could learn from this about other systems  like brains and data networks that we engineer  and even cancer. So what all these systems have in common is that there's no central control. An ant colony consists of sterile female workers    those are the ants you see walking around   and then one or more reproductive females who just lay the eggs. They don't give any instructions. Even though they're called queens  they don't tell anybody what to do. So in an ant colony  there's no one in charge  and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions. Ants interact using smell. They smell with their antennae  and they interact with their antennae  so when one ant touches another with its antennae  it can tell  for example  if the other ant is a nestmate and what task that other ant has been doing. So here you see a lot of ants moving around and interacting in a lab arena that's connected by tubes to two other arenas. So when one ant meets another  it doesn't matter which ant it meets  and they're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message. All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants. And all of these interactions  taken together  produce a network. So this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena  and it's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony  like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest  or how many are going out to forage. A brain actually works in the same way  but what's great about ants is that you can see the whole network as it happens. There are more than        species of ants  in every conceivable environment  and they're using interactions differently to meet different environmental challenges. So one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs  just what it takes to run the system. And another environmental challenge is resources  finding them and collecting them. In the desert  operating costs are high because water is scarce  and the seed eating ants that I study in the desert have to spend water to get water. So an ant outside foraging  searching for seeds in the hot sun  just loses water into the air. But the colony gets its water by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat. So in this environment  interactions are used to activate foraging. An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers  and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel  into the nest  and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out. This makes sense for the ant colony  because the more food there is out there  the more quickly the foragers find it  the faster they come back  and the more foragers they send out. The system works to stay stopped  unless something positive happens. So interactions function to activate foragers. And we've been studying the evolution of this system. First of all  there's variation. It turns out that colonies are different. On dry days  some colonies forage less  so colonies are different in how they manage this trade off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds. And we're trying to understand why some colonies forage less than others by thinking about ants as neurons  using models from neuroscience. So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire  an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage. And what we're looking for is whether there might be small differences among colonies in how many interactions each ant needs before it's willing to go out and forage  because a colony like that would forage less. And this raises an analogous question about brains. We talk about the brain  but of course every brain is slightly different  and maybe there are some individuals or some conditions in which the electrical properties of neurons are such that they require more stimulus to fire  and that would lead to differences in brain function. So in order to ask evolutionary questions  we need to know about reproductive success. This is a map of the study site where I have been tracking this population of harvester ant colonies for    years  which is about as long as a colony lives. Each symbol is a colony  and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had  because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies  that is  to figure out which colonies were founded by a daughter queen produced by which parent colony. And this was amazing for me  after all these years  to find out  for example  that colony      whom I've known well for many years  is a great grandmother. Here's her daughter colony  here's her granddaughter colony  and these are her great granddaughter colonies. And by doing this  I was able to learn that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies in their decisions about which days are so hot that they don't forage  and the offspring of parent colonies live so far from each other that the ants never meet  so the ants of the offspring colony can't be learning this from the parent colony. And so our next step is to look for the genetic variation underlying this resemblance. So then I was able to ask  okay  who's doing better  Over the time of the study  and especially in the past    years  there's been a very severe and deepening drought in the Southwestern U.S.  and it turns out that the colonies that conserve water  that stay in when it's really hot outside  and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible  are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies. So all this time  I thought that colony     was a loser  because on really dry days  there'd be just this trickle of foraging  while the other colonies were out foraging  getting lots of food  but in fact  colony     is a huge success. She's a matriarch. She's one of the rare great grandmothers on the site. To my knowledge  this is the first time that we've been able to track the ongoing evolution of collective behavior in a natural population of animals and find out what's actually working best. Now  the Internet uses an algorithm to regulate the flow of data that's very similar to the one that the harvester ants are using to regulate the flow of foragers. And guess what we call this analogy  The anternet is coming. So data doesn't leave the source computer unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth for it to travel on. In the early days of the Internet  when operating costs were really high and it was really important not to lose any data  then the system was set up for interactions to activate the flow of data. It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm that's so similar to the one that we recently invented  but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms that we know about  and ants have had     million years to evolve a lot of good ones  and I think it's very likely that some of the other        species are going to have interesting algorithms for data networks that we haven't even thought of yet. So what happens when operating costs are low  Operating costs are low in the tropics  because it's very humid  and it's easy for the ants to be outside walking around. But the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics that there's a lot of competition. Whatever resource one species is using  another species is likely to be using that at the same time. So in this environment  interactions are used in the opposite way. The system keeps going unless something negative happens  and one species that I study makes circuits in the trees of foraging ants going from the nest to a food source and back  just round and round  unless something negative happens  like an interaction with ants of another species. So here's an example of ant security. In the middle  there's an ant plugging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions with another species. Those are the little ones running around with their abdomens up in the air. But as soon as the threat is passed  the entrance is open again  and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough that we could just block access temporarily in response to an immediate threat  and then open it again  instead of trying to build a permanent firewall or fortress. So another environmental challenge that all systems have to deal with is resources  finding and collecting them. And to do this  ants solve the problem of collective search  and this is a problem that's of great interest right now in robotics  because we've understood that  rather than sending a single  sophisticated  expensive robot out to explore another planet or to search a burning building  that instead  it may be more effective to get a group of cheaper robots exchanging only minimal information  and that's the way that ants do it. So the invasive Argentine ant makes expandable search networks. They're good at dealing with the main problem of collective search  which is the trade off between searching very thoroughly and covering a lot of ground. And what they do is  when there are many ants in a small space  then each one can search very thoroughly because there will be another ant nearby searching over there  but when there are a few ants in a large space  then they need to stretch out their paths to cover more ground. I think they use interactions to assess density  so when they're really crowded  they meet more often  and they search more thoroughly. Different ant species must use different algorithms  because they've evolved to deal with different resources  and it could be really useful to know about this  and so we recently asked ants to solve the collective search problem in the extreme environment of microgravity in the International Space Station. When I first saw this picture  I thought  Oh no  they've mounted the habitat vertically  but then I realized that  of course  it doesn't matter. So the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they're less likely to interact  and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up. We're still analyzing the data. I don't have the results yet. But it would be interesting to know how other species solve this problem in different environments on Earth  and so we're setting up a program to encourage kids around the world to try this experiment with different species. It's very simple. It can be done with cheap materials. And that way  we could make a global map of ant collective search algorithms. And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species  the ones that come into our buildings  are going to be really good at this  because they're in your kitchen because they're really good at finding food and water. So the most familiar resource for ants is a picnic  and this is a clustered resource. When there's one piece of fruit  there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby  and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions for recruitment. So when one ant meets another  or when it meets a chemical deposited on the ground by another  then it changes direction to follow in the direction of the interaction  and that's how you get the trail of ants sharing your picnic. Now this is a place where I think we might be able to learn something from ants about cancer. I mean  first  it's obvious that we could do a lot to prevent cancer by not allowing people to spread around or sell the toxins that promote the evolution of cancer in our bodies  but I don't think the ants can help us much with this because ants never poison their own colonies. But we might be able to learn something from ants about treating cancer. There are many different kinds of cancer. Each one originates in a particular part of the body  and then some kinds of cancer will spread or metastasize to particular other tissues where they must be getting resources that they need. So if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they're out searching around for the resources that they need  if those resources are clustered  they're likely to use interactions for recruitment  and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting  then maybe we could set traps to catch them before they become established. So ants are using interactions in different ways in a huge variety of environments  and we could learn from this about other systems that operate without central control. Using only simple interactions  ant colonies have been performing amazing feats for more than     million years. We have a lot to learn from them. Thank you. I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after    years of service. The majority of those    years was spent patrolling the southern end of Marin County  which includes the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge is an iconic structure  known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco  the Pacific Ocean  and its inspiring architecture. Unfortunately  it is also a magnet for suicide  being one of the most utilized sites in the world. The Golden Gate Bridge opened in     . Joseph Strauss  chief engineer in charge of building the bridge  was quoted as saying   The bridge is practically suicide proof. Suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable.  But since its opening  over       people have leapt to their death from that bridge. Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension    this bridge has been romanticized as such   that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief  and the waters below will cleanse your soul. But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide. After a free fall of four to five seconds  the body strikes the water at about    miles an hour. That impact shatters bones  some of which then puncture vital organs. Most die on impact. Those that don't generally flail in the water helplessly  and then drown. I don't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face. This is the cord. Except for around the two towers  there is    inches of steel paralleling the bridge. This is where most folks stand before taking their lives. I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord  and at their darkest time  it is very difficult to bring them back. I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life. I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail. When I first began working on the bridge  we had no formal training. You struggled to funnel your way through these calls. This was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide  but to the officers as well. We've come a long  long way since then. Now  veteran officers and psychologists train new officers. This is Jason Garber. I met Jason on July    of last year when I get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near midspan. I responded  and when I arrived  I observed Jason speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer. Jason was just    years old and had flown out here from New Jersey. As a matter of fact  he had flown out here on two other occasions from New Jersey to attempt suicide on this bridge. After about an hour of speaking with Jason  he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box. Recalling your Greek mythology  Zeus created Pandora  and sent her down to Earth with a box  and told her   Never  ever open that box.  Well one day  curiosity got the better of Pandora  and she did open the box. Out flew plagues  sorrows  and all sorts of evils against man. The only good thing in the box was hope. Jason then asked us   What happens when you open the box and hope isn't there   He paused a few moments  leaned to his right  and was gone. This kind  intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide. I spoke with Jason's parents that evening  and I suppose that  when I was speaking with them  that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well  because that very next day  their family rabbi called to check on me. Jason's parents had asked him to do so. The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people. I pose these questions to you  What would you do if your family member  friend or loved one was suicidal  What would you say  Would you know what to say  In my experience  it's not just the talking that you do  but the listening. Listen to understand. Don't argue  blame  or tell the person you know how they feel  because you probably don't. By just being there  you may just be the turning point that they need. If you think someone is suicidal  don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question. One way of asking them the question is like this   Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life  have you had these thoughts   Confronting the person head on may just save their life and be the turning point for them. Some other signs to look for  hopelessness  believing that things are terrible and never going to get better  helplessness  believing that there is nothing that you can do about it  recent social withdrawal  and a loss of interest in life. I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago  and I received an email from a lady that I'd like to read you her letter. She lost her son on January    of this year  and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago  and it's with her permission and blessing that I read this to you.  Hi  Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference. That must be quite the experience to be there. I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend. Just wanted to drop you a note. Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends  etc. I'm still pretty numb  but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn't coming home. Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco to watch the   ers game with his father on January   . He never made it there. I called Petaluma police and reported him missing that evening. The next morning  two officers came to my home and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge. A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at      p.m. the previous day. Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves. Who hasn't been low before without suffering from a true mental illness  It shouldn't be so easy to end it. My prayers are with you for your fight. The GGB  Golden Gate Bridge  is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay  not a graveyard. Good luck this week. Vicky.  I can't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day  and also the courage just to carry on. I'd like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and courage. On March    of       I responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower. I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man  Kevin Berthia  standing on the sidewalk. When he saw me  he immediately traversed that pedestrian rail  and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tower. For the next hour and a half  I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness. Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance. When Kevin came back over  I congratulated him.  This is a new beginning  a new life.  But I asked him   What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance   And you know what he told me  He said   You listened. You let me speak  and you just listened.  Shortly after this incident  I received a letter from Kevin's mother  and I have that letter with me  and I'd like to read it to you.  Dear Mr. Briggs  Nothing will erase the events of March     but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us. I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help. He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medicated. I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old  completely unaware of any hereditary traits  but  thank God  now we know. Kevin is straight  as he says. We truly thank God for you. Sincerely indebted to you  Narvella Berthia.  And on the bottom she writes   P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening  you were listed as the patient. Boy  did I have to straighten that one out.  Today  Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society. He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others. Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job. It's personal. My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning. That act  although ending his own pain  robbed me from ever getting to know him. This is what suicide does. For most suicidal folks  or those contemplating suicide  they wouldn't think of hurting another person. They just want their own pain to end. Typically  this is accomplished in just three ways  sleep  drugs or alcohol  or death. In my career  I've responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge. Of those incidents I've been directly involved with  I've only lost two  but that's two too many. One was Jason. The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour. During that time  he shook my hand on three occasions. On that final handshake  he looked at me  and he said   Kevin  I'm sorry  but I have to go.  And he leapt. Horrible  absolutely horrible. I do want to tell you  though  the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide. Additionally  that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it  that one to two percent  most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail  they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live. I tell people  the bridge not only connects Marin to San Francisco  but people together also. That connection  or bridge that we make  is something that each and every one of us should strive to do. Suicide is preventable. There is help. There is hope. Thank you very much.  Pheromone  is a very powerful word. It conjures up sex  abandon  loss of control  and you can see  it's very important as a word. But it's only    years old. It was invented in     . Now  if you put that word into the web  as you may have done  you'll come up with millions of hits  and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you something to make you irresistible for    dollars or more. Now  this is a very attractive idea  and the molecules they mention sound really science y. They've got lots of syllables. It's things like androstenol  androstenone or androstadienone. It gets better and better  and when you combine that with white lab coats  you must imagine that there is fantastic science behind this. But sadly  these are fraudulent claims supported by dodgy science. The problem is that  although there are many good scientists working on what they think are human pheromones  and they're publishing in respectable journals  at the basis of this  despite very sophisticated experiments  there really is no good science behind it  because it's based on a problem  which is nobody has systematically gone through all the odors that humans produce    and there are thousands of molecules that we give off. We're mammals. We produce a lot of smell. Nobody has gone through systematically to work out which molecules really are pheromones. They've just plucked a few  and all these experiments are based on those  but there's no good evidence at all. Now  that's not to say that smell is not important to people. It is  and some people are real enthusiasts  and one of these was Napoleon. And famously  you may remember that out on the campaign trail for war  he wrote to his lover  Empress Josephine  saying   Don't wash. I'm coming home.  So he didn't want to lose any of her richness in the days before he'd get home  and it is still  you'll find websites that offer this as a major quirk. At the same time  though  we spend about as much money taking the smells off us as putting them back on in perfumes  and perfumes are a multi billion dollar business. So what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you about what pheromones really are  tell you why I think we would expect humans to have pheromones  tell you about some of the confusions in pheromones  and then finally  I want to end with a promising avenue which shows us the way we ought to be going. So the ancient Greeks knew that dogs sent invisible signals between each other. A female dog in heat sent an invisible signal to male dogs for miles around  and it wasn't a sound  it was a smell. You could take the smell from the female dog  and the dogs would chase the cloth. But the problem for everybody who could see this effect was that you couldn't identify the molecules. You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical. The reason for that  of course  is that each of these animals produces tiny quantities  and in the case of the dog  males dogs can smell it  but we can't smell it. And it was only in      that a German team  after spending    years in search of these molecules  discovered  identified  the first pheromone  and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth. Now  this was an inspired choice  by Adolf Butenandt and his team  because he needed half a million moths to get enough material to do the chemical analysis. But he created the model for how you should go about pheromone analysis. He basically went through systematically  showing that only the molecule in question was the one that stimulated the males  not all the others. He analyzed it very carefully. He synthesized the molecule  and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males and got them to respond and showed it was  indeed  that molecule. That's closing the circle. That's the thing which has never been done with humans  nothing systematic  no real demonstration. With that new concept  we needed a new word  and that was the word  pheromone   and it's basically transferred excitement  transferred between individuals  and since       pheromones have been found right the way across the animal kingdom  in male animals  in female animals. It works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters. And almost every mammal you can think of has had a pheromone identified  and of course  an enormous number of insects. So we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom. What about humans  Well  the first thing  of course  is that we're mammals  and mammals are smelly. As any dog owner can tell you  we smell  they smell. But the real reason we might think that humans have pheromones is the change that occurs as we grow up. The smell of a room of teenagers is quite different from the smell of a room of small children. What's changed  And of course  it's puberty. Along with the pubic hair and the hair in the armpits  new glands start to secrete in those places  and that's what's making the change in smell. If we were any other kind of mammal  or any other kind of animal  we would say   That must be something to do with pheromones   and we'd start looking properly. But there are some problems  and this is why  I think  people have not looked for pheromones so effectively in humans. There are  indeed  problems. And the first of these is perhaps surprising. It's all about culture. Now moths don't learn a lot about what is good to smell  but humans do  and up to the age of about four  any smell  no matter how rancid  is simply interesting. And I understand that the major role of parents is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo  because it's always something nice to smell. But gradually we learn what's not good  and one of the things we learn at the same time as what is not good is what is good. Now  the cheese behind me is a British  if not an English  delicacy. It's ripe blue Stilton. Liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries. Every culture has its own special food and national delicacy. If you were to come from Iceland  your national dish is deep rotted shark. Now  all of these things are acquired tastes  but they form almost a badge of identity. You're part of the in group. The second thing is the sense of smell. Each of us has a unique odor world  in the sense that what we smell  we each smell a completely different world. Now  smell was the hardest of the senses to crack  and the Nobel Prize awarded to Richard Axel and Linda Buck was only awarded in      for their discovery of how smell works. It's really hard  but in essence  nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors  and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors  and if they bond  they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain. We don't just have one kind of receptor. If you're a human  you have about     different kinds of receptors  and the brain knows what you're smelling because of the combination of receptors and nerve cells that they trigger  sending messages up to the brain in a combinatorial fashion. But it's a bit more complicated  because each of those     comes in various variants  and depending which variant you have  you might smell coriander  or cilantro  that herb  either as something delicious and savory or something like soap. So we each have an individual world of smell  and that complicates anything when we're studying smell. Well  we really ought to talk about armpits  and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones. Now  I'm not going to share them with you  but this is the place that most people have looked for pheromones. There is one good reason  which is  the great apes have armpits as their unique characteristic. The other primates have scent glands in other parts of the body. The great apes have these armpits full of secretory glands producing smells all the time  enormous numbers of molecules. When they're secreted from the glands  the molecules are odorless. They have no smell at all  and it's only the wonderful bacteria growing on the rainforest of hair that actually produces the smells that we know and love. And so incidentally  if you want to reduce the amount of smell  clear cutting your armpits is a very effective way of reducing the habitat for bacteria  and you'll find they remain less smelly for much longer. But although we've focused on armpits  I think it's partly because they're the least embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples. There is actually another reason why we might not be looking for a universal sex pheromone there  and that's because    percent of the world's population doesn't have smelly armpits like me. And these are people from China  Japan  Korea  and other parts of northeast Asia. They simply don't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits. So it doesn't apply to    percent of the world. So what should we be doing in our search for human pheromones  I'm fairly convinced that we do have them. We're mammals  like everybody else who's a mammal  and we probably do have them. But what I think we should do is go right back to the beginning  and basically look all over the body. No matter how embarrassing  we need to search and go for the first time where no one else has dared tread. It's going to be difficult  it's going to be embarrassing  but we need to look. We also need to go back to the ideas that Butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth. We need to go back and look systematically at all the molecules that are being produced  and work out which ones are really involved. It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple and say   They'll do.  We have to actually demonstrate that they really have the effects we claim. There is one team that I'm actually very impressed by. They're in France  and their previous success was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone. They've turned their attention now to human babies and mothers. So this is a baby having a drink of milk from its mother's breast. Her nipple is completely hidden by the baby's head  but what you'll notice is a white droplet with an arrow pointing to it  and that's the secretion from the areolar glands. Now  we all have them  men and women  and these are the little bumps around the nipple  and if you're a lactating woman  these start to secrete. It's a very interesting secretion. What Benoist Schaal and his team developed was a simple test to investigate what the effect of this secretion might be  in effect  a simple bioassay. So this is a sleeping baby  and under its nose  we've put a clean glass rod. The baby remains sleeping  showing no interest at all. But if we go to any mother who is secreting from the areolar glands  so it's not about recognition  it can be from any mother  if we take the secretion and now put it under the baby's nose  we get a very different reaction. It's a connoisseur's reaction of delight  and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue and starts to suck. Now  since this is from any mother  it could really be a pheromone. It's not about individual recognition. Any mother will do. Now  why is this important  apart from being simply very interesting  It's because women vary in the number of areolar glands that they have  and there is a correlation between the ease with which babies start to suckle and the number of areolar glands she has. It appears that the more secretions she's got  the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly. If you're a mammal  the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth. You have to get that first drink of milk  and if you don't get it  you won't survive. You'll be dead. Since many babies actually find it difficult to take that first meal  because they're not getting the right stimulus  if we could identify what that molecule was  and the French team are being very cautious  but if we could identify the molecule  synthesize it  it would then mean premature babies would be more likely to suckle  and every baby would have a better chance of survival. So what I want to argue is this is one example of where a systematic  really scientific approach can actually bring you a real understanding of pheromones. There could be all sorts of medical interventions. There could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pheromones that we simply don't know at the moment. What we need to remember is pheromones are not just about sex. They're about all sorts of things to do with a mammal's life. So do go forward and do search for more. There's lots to find. Thank you very much. The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online started out the way most things do  without me  and not online. On December           the man on the medal  Alfred Nobel  died. One hundred years later  exactly  actually  December           this charming lady  Wislawa Szymborska  won the Nobel Prize for literature. She's a Polish poet. She's a big deal  obviously  but back in '    I thought I had never heard of her  and when I checked out her work  I found this sweet little poem   Four in the Morning.   The hour from night to day. The hour from side to side. The hour for those past thirty...  And it goes on  but as soon as I read this poem  I fell for it hard  so hard  I suspected we must have met somewhere before. Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem  Did I flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere  I could not place it  and it bugged me  and then in the coming week or two  I would just be watching an old movie  and this would happen. We didn't get home till around four in the morning. Rives  My roommates would have the TV on  and this would happen. watching that Omen trilogy. Rives  I would be listening to music  and this would happen. Rives  So you can see what was going on  right  Obviously  the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me. Some people get a number stuck in their head  you may recognize a certain name or a tune  some people get nothing  but four in the morning was in me now  but mildly  like a groin injury. I always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually  and I never talked about it with anybody  but it did not  and I totally did. In       I was invited to speak at TED for the second time  and since I was still an authority on nothing  I thought  what if I made a multimedia presentation on a topic so niche it is actually inconsequential or actually cockamamie. So my talk had some of my four in the morning examples  but it also had examples from my fellow TED speakers that year. I found four in the morning in a novel by Isabel Allende. I found a really great one in the autobiography of Bill Clinton. I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening  although Matt Groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and I gather that he is not an early riser. However  had Matt been there  he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory that was un freaking canny for me to assemble. It was totally contrived just for that room  just for that moment. That's how we did it in the pre TED.com days. It was fun. That was pretty much it. When I got home  though  the emails started coming in from people who had seen the talk live  beginning with  and this is still my favorite   Here's another one for your collection  'It's the friends you can call up at   a.m. that matter.'  The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich. The email itself was from another very sexy European type  TED Curator Chris Anderson. Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something  and I'm thinking  this man is the Typhoid Mary of ideas worth spreading  and I have infected him. I am contagious  which was confirmed less than a week later when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent an actual greeting card with that same quotation. As a bonus  she hooked me up with a second one they make. It says   Just knowing I can call you at four in the morning if I need to makes me not really need to   which I love  because together these are like   Hallmark  When you care enough to send the very best twice  phrased slightly differently.  I was not surprised at the TEDster and New Yorker magazine overlap. A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.  It's   a.m. maybe you'd sleep better if you bought some crap.  I was surprised at the TEDster  Rugrats  overlap. More than one person sent me this. Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding  Stu Pickles  Because I've lost control of my life. Rives  And then there was the lone TEDster who was disgruntled I had overlooked what he considers to be a classic. Roy  No  it's not an accident. You wanted to get out of the house anyway  right  Ronnie  Not at four o'clock in the morning. Rives  So that's  Close Encounters   and the main character is all worked up because aliens  momentously  have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning  which does make that a very solid example. Those were all really solid examples. They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem. But they followed the pattern. They played along. Right  Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour when all these dramatic occurrences allegedly occur. Maybe this was some kind of cliche that had never been taxonomized before. Maybe I was on the trail of a new meme or something. Just when things were getting pretty interesting  things got really interesting. TED.com launched  later that year  with a bunch of videos from past talks  including mine  and I started receiving  four in the morning  citations from what seemed like every time zone on the planet. Much of it was content I never would have found on my own if I was looking for it  and I was not. I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes. I probably would have missed the booklet   Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning.  I do not subscribe to Crochet Today  magazine  although it looks delightful.  Laughter  Take note of those clock ends. This is a college student's suggestion for what a  four in the morning  gang sign should look like. People sent me magazine ads. They took photographs in grocery stores. I got a ton of graphic novels and comics. A lot of good quality work  too   The Sandman    Watchmen.  There's a very cute example here from  Calvin and Hobbes.  In fact  the oldest citation anybody sent in was from a cartoon from the Stone Age. Take a look. Fred Flintstone  Like at   a.m.  that's how early. Rives  And the flip side of the timeline  this is from the   st century. A thousand years from now  people are still doing this. Rives  It shows the spectrum. I received so many songs  TV shows  movies  like from dismal to famous  I could give you a four hour playlist. If I just stick to modern male movie stars  I keep it to the length of about a commercial. Here's your sampler. Rives  So somewhere along the line  I realized I have a hobby I didn't know I wanted  and it is crowdsourced. But I was also thinking what you might be thinking  which is really  couldn't you do this with any hour of the day  First of all  you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon. Secondly  I did a little research. You know  I was kind of interested. If this is confirmation bias  there is so much confirmation  I am biased. Literature probably shows it best. There are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare. There's a five in the morning. There are seven four in the mornings  and they're all very dire. In  Measure for Measure   it's the call time for the executioner. Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia at four in the morning right before battle in  War and Peace.  Charlotte Bront 's  Jane Eyre  has got kind of a pivotal four in the morning  as does Emily Bront 's  Wuthering Heights.   Lolita  has as a creepy four in the morning.  Huckleberry Finn  has one in dialect. Someone sent in H.G. Wells'  The Invisible Man.  Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's  Invisible Man.   The Great Gatsby  spends the last four in the morning of his life waiting for a lover who never shows  and the most famous wake up in literature  perhaps   The Metamorphosis.  First paragraph  the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach  but we already know  cockroach notwithstanding  something is up with this guy. Why  His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning. What kind of person would do that  This kind of person would do that. But of course  there is no news yet. Everyone's still asleep in their comfy  comfy beds. Rives  Exactly. So that's Lucy from the Peanuts   Mommie Dearest   Rocky  first day of training  Nelson Mandela  first day in office  and Bart Simpson  which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a dinner party and gives me yet another category  people waking up  in my big old database. Just imagine that your friends and your family have heard that you collect  say  stuffed polar bears  and they send them to you. Even if you don't really  at a certain point  you totally collect stuffed polar bears  and your collection is probably pretty kick ass. And when I got to that point  I embraced it. I got my curator on. I started fact checking  downloading  illegally screen grabbing. I started archiving. My hobby had become a habit  and my habit gave me possibly the world's most eclectic Netflix queue. At one point  it went   Guys and Dolls  The Musical    Last Tango in Paris    Diary of a Wimpy Kid    Porn Star  Legend of Ron Jeremy.  Why  Porn Star  Legend of Ron Jeremy   Because someone told me I would find this clip in there. in Flushing  Queens on March            at four o'clock in the morning. Rives  Of course he was.  Laughter   Applause  Yeah. Not only does it seem to make sense  it also answers the question   What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir have in common   Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence   I was born at four o'clock in the morning   which I had because someone else had emailed it to me  and when they did  I had another bump up in my entry for this  because porn star Ron Jeremy and feminist Simone de Beauvoir are not just different people. They are different people that have this thing connecting them  and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge or inadvertent expertise  but I did wonder  is there maybe a cooler way to do this  So last October  in gentleman scholar tradition  I put the entire collection online as  Museum of Four in the Morning.  You can click on that red  refresh  button. It will take you at random to one of hundreds of snippets that are in the collection. Here is a knockout poem by Billy Collins called  Forgetfulness.  in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war. No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart. Rives  So the first hour of this project was satisfying. A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe. Half a globe away  a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me  a stranger. Less than a week later  though  I received a little bit of grace. I received a poignant tweet. It was brief. It just said   Reminds me of an ancient mix tape.  The name was a pseudonym  actually  or a pseudo pseudonym. As soon as I saw the initials  and the profile pic  I knew immediately  my whole body knew immediately who this was  and I knew immediately what mix tape she was talking about. L.D. was my college romance. This is in the early '  s. I was an undegrad. She was a grad student in the library sciences department. Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off  lets her hair down  suddenly she's smoking hot. She was already smoking hot  she was super dorky  and we had a December May romance  meaning we started dating in December  and by May  she had graduated and became my one that got away. But her mix tape did not get away. I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards  not just from L.D.  from my life  but for decades. It's the kind of box where  if I have a girlfriend  I tend to hide it from her  and if I had a wife  I'm sure I would share it with her  but the story    Laughter    with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side  but no song titles. Instead  L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress classification system  including page numbers  to leave me clues. When I got this mix tape  I put it in my cassette player  I took it to the campus library  her library  I found    books on the shelves. I remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table  and I read poems paired to songs like food to wine  paired  I can tell you  like saddle shoes to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress. I did this again last October. I'm sitting there  I got new earbuds  old Walkman  I realize this is just the kind of extravagance I used to take for granted even when I was extravagant. And then I thought   Good for him.   PG  is Slavic literature.        series Polish literature. Z A   is a collection of    poems. Page    is Wislawa Szymborska's poem paired with Paul Simon's  Peace Like a River.    I woke up from out of my dream   Rives  Thank you. Appreciate it.  Applause  There's a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September        . On that day  a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials  a group of Afghan government officials  who would be meeting with some local village elders. The column came under ambush  and was surrounded on three sides  and amongst many other things  Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead. One of the people he rescued was a sergeant  and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter. And what was remarkable about this day is  by sheer coincidence  one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck. They put him in the helicopter  and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more. I saw this  and I thought to myself  where do people like that come from  What is that  That is some deep  deep emotion  when you would want to do that. There's a love there  and I wanted to know why is it that I don't have people that I work with like that  You know  in the military  they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. In business  we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain. We have it backwards. Right  So I asked myself  where do people like this come from  And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people. That's why they're attracted to the military. These better people are attracted to this concept of service. But that's completely wrong. What I learned was that it's the environment  and if you get the environment right  every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things  and more importantly  others have that capacity too. I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these  who we would call heroes  who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others  and I asked them   Why would you do it  Why did you do it   And they all say the same thing   Because they would have done it for me.  It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation. So trust and cooperation are really important here. The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings  they are not instructions. I can't simply say to you   Trust me   and you will. I can't simply instruct two people  to cooperate  and they will. It's not how it works. It's a feeling. So where does that feeling come from  If you go back        years to the Paleolithic era  to the early days of Homo sapiens  what we find is that the world was filled with danger  all of these forces working very  very hard to kill us. Nothing personal. Whether it was the weather  lack of resources  maybe a saber toothed tiger  all of these things working to reduce our lifespan. And so we evolved into social animals  where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety  inside the tribe  where we felt like we belonged. And when we felt safe amongst our own  the natural reaction was trust and cooperation. There are inherent benefits to this. It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger. If we don't trust each other  if I don't trust you  that means you won't watch for danger. Bad system of survival. The modern day is exactly the same thing. The world is filled with danger  things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success  reduce our opportunity for success. It could be the ups and downs in the economy  the uncertainty of the stock market. It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight. Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you. It's sometimes trying to put you out of business  but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you. We have no control over these forces. These are a constant  and they're not going away. The only variable are the conditions inside the organization  and that's where leadership matters  because it's the leader that sets the tone. When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first  to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results  so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong  remarkable things happen. I was flying on a trip  and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called  and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law  like a criminal. He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon. So I said something. I said   Why do you have treat us like cattle  Why can't you treat us like human beings   And this is exactly what she said to me. She said   Sir  if I don't follow the rules  I could get in trouble or lose my job.  All she was telling me is that she doesn't feel safe. All she was telling me is that she doesn't trust her leaders. The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people. It's because they don't fear their leaders. You see  if the conditions are wrong  we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other  and that inherently weakens the organization. When we feel safe inside the organization  we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities. The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is  is like being a parent. If you think about what being a great parent is  what do you want  What makes a great parent  We want to give our child opportunities  education  discipline them when necessary  all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves. Great leaders want exactly the same thing. They want to provide their people opportunity  education  discipline when necessary  build their self confidence  give them the opportunity to try and fail  all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves. Charlie Kim  who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City  a tech company  he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family  would you ever consider laying off one of your children  We would never do it. Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization  Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment. If you get a job at Next Jump  you cannot get fired for performance issues. In fact  if you have issues  they will coach you and they will give you support  just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school. It's the complete opposite. This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred  anger  at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures. It's not the numbers. It's that they have violated the very definition of leadership. They have violated this deep seated social contract. We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests  or worse  they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests. This is what so offends us  not the numbers. Would anybody be offended if we gave a      million bonus to Gandhi  How about a      million bonus to Mother Teresa  Do we have an issue with that  None at all. None at all. Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers. They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Bob Chapman  who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry Wehmiller  in      was hit very hard by the recession  and they lost    percent of their orders overnight. Now in a large manufacturing company  this is a big deal  and they could no longer afford their labor pool. They needed to save    million dollars  so  like so many companies today  the board got together and discussed layoffs. And Bob refused. You see  Bob doesn't believe in head counts. Bob believes in heart counts  and it's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count. And so they came up with a furlough program. Every employee  from secretary to CEO  was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation. They could take it any time they wanted  and they did not have to take it consecutively. But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much. He said  it's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot  and morale went up. They saved    million dollars  and most importantly  as would be expected  when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization  the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate. And quite spontaneously  nobody expected  people started trading with each other. Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less. People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three. Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank. I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. They are authorities  and we do what they say because they have authority over us  but we would not follow them. And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders  and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them  and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them. This is what a leader is. I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater  and as is the Marine custom  the officer ate last  and he let his men eat first  and when they were done  there was no food left for him. And when they went back out in the field  his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat  because that's what happens. We call them leaders because they go first. We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does. We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain  and when we do  the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us. They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader's vision comes to life  and when we ask them   Why would you do that  Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person   they all say the same thing   Because they would have done it for me.  And isn't that the organization we would all like to work in  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  You may be wondering why a marine biologist from Oceana would come here today to talk to you about world hunger. I'm here today because saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire. It's more than a thing we're doing because we want to create jobs for fishermen or preserve fishermen's jobs. It's more than an economic pursuit. Saving the oceans can feed the world. Let me show you how. As you know  there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet. We're expecting that problem to get worse as world population grows to nine billion or    billion by midcentury  and we can expect to have greater pressure on our food resources. And this is a big concern  especially considering where we are now. Now we know that our arable land per capita is already on the decline in both developed and developing countries. We know that we're headed for climate change  which is going to change rainfall patterns  making some areas drier  as you can see in orange  and others wetter  in blue  causing droughts in our breadbaskets  in places like the Midwest and Central Europe  and floods in others. It's going to make it harder for the land to help us solve the hunger problem. And that's why the oceans need to be their most abundant  so that the oceans can provide us as much food as possible. And that's something the oceans have been doing for us for a long time. As far back as we can go  we've seen an increase in the amount of food we've been able to harvest from our oceans. It just seemed like it was continuing to increase  until about       when we started to see a decline. You've heard of peak oil. Maybe this is peak fish. I hope not. I'm going to come back to that. But you can see about an    percent decline in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch since     . And this is a big problem. It's continuing. This red line is continuing to go down. But we know how to turn it around  and that's what I'm going to talk about today. We know how to turn that curve back upwards. This doesn't have to be peak fish. If we do a few simple things in targeted places  we can bring our fisheries back and use them to feed people. First we want to know where the fish are  so let's look where the fish are. It turns out the fish  conveniently  are located for the most part in our coastal areas of the countries  in coastal zones  and these are areas that national jurisdictions have control over  and they can manage their fisheries in these coastal areas. Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions that go out about     nautical miles  in areas that are called exclusive economic zones  and this is a good thing that they can control their fisheries in these areas  because the high seas  which are the darker areas on this map  the high seas  it's a lot harder to control things  because it has to be done internationally. You get into international agreements  and if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement  you know this can be a very slow  frustrating  tedious process. And so controlling things nationally is a great thing to be able to do. How many fish are actually in these coastal areas compared to the high seas  Well  you can see here about seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas  so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing  because we can actually get a lot done. We can restore a lot of our fisheries if we focus in these coastal areas. But how many of these countries do we have to work in  There's something like    coastal countries. Do we have to fix fisheries management in all of those countries  So we asked ourselves  how many countries do we need to focus on  keeping in mind that the European Union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy  So if we got good fisheries management in the European Union and  say  nine other countries  how much of our fisheries would we be covering  Turns out  European Union plus nine countries covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch. If we took it up to    countries plus the European Union  we would up to    percent  almost all of the world's fish catch. So we think we can work in a limited number of places to make the fisheries come back. But what do we have to do in these places  Well  based on our work in the United States and elsewhere  we know that there are three key things we have to do to bring fisheries back  and they are  We need to set quotas or limits on how much we take  we need to reduce bycatch  which is the accidental catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting  and it's very wasteful  and three  we need to protect habitats  the nursery areas  the spawning areas that these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully so that they can rebuild their populations. If we do those three things  we  know the fisheries will come back. How do we know  We know because we've seen it happening in a lot of different places. This is a slide that shows the herring population in Norway that was crashing since the     s. It was coming down  and when Norway set limits  or quotas  on its fishery  what happens  The fishery comes back. This is another example  also happens to be from Norway  of the Norwegian Arctic cod. Same deal. The fishery is crashing. They set limits on discards. Discards are these fish they weren't targeting and they get thrown overboard wastefully. When they set the discard limit  the fishery came back. And it's not just in Norway. We've seen this happening in countries all around the world  time and time again. When these countries step in and they put in sustainable fisheries management policies  the fisheries  which are always crashing  it seems  are starting to come back. So there's a lot of promise here. What does this mean for the world fish catch  This means that if we take that fishery catch that's on the decline and we could turn it upwards  we could increase it up to     million metric tons per year. So we didn't have peak fish yet. We still have an opportunity to not only bring the fish back but to actually get more fish that can feed more people than we currently are now. How many more  Right about now  we can feed about     million people a fish meal a day based on the current world fish catch  which  of course  you know is going down  so that number will go down over time if we don't fix it  but if we put fishery management practices like the ones I've described in place in    to    countries  we could bring that number up and feed as many as     million people a year a healthy fish meal. We should obviously do this just because it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem  but it's also cost effective. It turns out fish is the most cost effective protein on the planet. If you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins  obviously  fish is a good business decision. It also doesn't need a lot of land  something that's in short supply  compared to other protein sources. And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water. It uses a lot less fresh water than  for example  cattle  where you have to irrigate a field so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle. It also has a very low carbon footprint. It has a little bit of a carbon footprint because we do have to get out and catch the fish. It takes a little bit of fuel  but as you know  agriculture can have a carbon footprint  and fish has a much smaller one  so it's less polluting. It's already a big part of our diet  but it can be a bigger part of our diet  which is a good thing  because we know that it's healthy for us. It can reduce our risks of cancer  heart disease and obesity. In fact  our CEO Andy Sharpless  who is the originator of this concept  actually  he likes to say fish is the perfect protein. Andy also talks about the fact that our ocean conservation movement really grew out of the land conservation movement  and in land conservation  we have this problem where biodiversity is at war with food production. You have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with  and so there's a constant push pull there. There's a constant tough decision that has to be made between two very important things  maintaining biodiversity and feeding people. But in the oceans  we don't have that war. In the oceans  biodiversity is not at war with abundance. In fact  they're aligned. When we do things that produce biodiversity  we actually get more abundance  and that's important so that we can feed people. Now  there's a catch. Didn't anyone get that   Laughter  Illegal fishing. Illegal fishing undermines the type of sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about. It can be when you catch fish using gears that have been prohibited  when you fish in places where you're not supposed to fish  you catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species. Illegal fishing cheats the consumer and it also cheats honest fishermen  and it needs to stop. The way illegal fish get into our  market is through seafood fraud. You might have heard about this. It's when fish are labeled as something they're not. Think about the last time you had fish. What were you eating  Are you sure that's what it was  Because we tested       different fish samples and about a third of them were not what they were labeled to be. Snappers  nine out of    snappers were not snapper. Fifty nine percent of the tuna we tested was mislabeled. And red snapper  we tested     samples  and only seven of them were really red snapper  so good luck finding a red snapper. Seafood has a really complex supply chain  and at every step in this supply chain  there's an opportunity for seafood fraud  unless we have traceability. Traceability is a way where the seafood industry can track the seafood from the boat to the plate to make sure that the consumer can then find out where their seafood came from. This is a really important thing. It's being done by some in the industry  but not enough  so we're pushing a law in Congress called the SAFE Seafood Act  and I'm very excited today to announce the release of a chef's petition  where     chefs have signed a petition calling on Congress to support the SAFE Seafood Act. It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know    Anthony Bourdain  Mario Batali  Barton Seaver and others   and they've signed it because they believe that people have a right to know about what they're eating. Fishermen like it too  so there's a good chance we can get the kind of support we need to get this bill through  and it comes at a critical time  because this is the way we stop seafood fraud  this is the way we curb illegal fishing  and this is the way we make sure that quotas  habitat protection  and bycatch reductions can do the jobs they can do. We know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably. We know that we can produce healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people that don't use the land  that don't use much water  have a low carbon footprint  and are cost effective. We know that saving the oceans can feed the world  and we need to start now. Thank you.  Applause  As a student of adversity  I've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges seem to draw strength from them  and I've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning. And for a long time  I thought the meaning was out there  some great truth waiting to be found. But over time  I've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant. We call it finding meaning  but we might better call it forging meaning. My last book was about how families manage to deal with various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring  and one of the mothers I interviewed  who had two children with multiple severe disabilities  said to me   People always give us these little sayings like  'God doesn't give you any more than you can handle ' but children like ours are not preordained as a gift. They're a gift because that's what we have chosen.  We make those choices all our lives. When I was in second grade  Bobby Finkel had a birthday party and invited everyone in our class but me. My mother assumed there had been some sort of error  and she called Mrs. Finkel  who said that Bobby didn't like me and didn't want me at his party. And that day  my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae. When I was in seventh grade  one of the kids on my school bus nicknamed me  Percy  as a shorthand for my demeanor  and sometimes  he and his cohort would chant that provocation the entire school bus ride     minutes up     minutes back   Percy  Percy  Percy  Percy   When I was in eighth grade  our science teacher told us that all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence because of the trauma to their anal sphincter. And I graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria  where I would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so  or sat with the boys and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls. I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance. What I didn't know then  and do know now  is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning. After you've forged meaning  you need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity. You need to take the traumas and make them part of who you've come to be  and you need to fold the worst events of your life into a narrative of triumph  evincing a better self in response to things that hurt. One of the other mothers I interviewed when I was working on my book had been raped as an adolescent  and had a child following that rape  which had thrown away her career plans and damaged all of her emotional relationships. But when I met her  she was     and I said to her   Do you often think about the man who raped you   And she said   I used to think about him with anger  but now only with pity.  And I thought she meant pity because he was so unevolved as to have done this terrible thing. And I said   Pity   And she said   Yes  because he has a beautiful daughter and two beautiful grandchildren and he doesn't know that  and I do. So as it turns out  I'm the lucky one.  Some of our struggles are things we're born to  our gender  our sexuality  our race  our disability. And some are things that happen to us  being a political prisoner  being a rape victim  being a Katrina survivor. Identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community  and to give strength there too. It involves substituting  and  for  but     not  I am here but I have cancer   but rather   I have cancer and I am here.  When we're ashamed  we can't tell our stories  and stories are the foundation of identity. Forge meaning  build identity  forge meaning and build identity. That became my mantra. Forging meaning is about changing yourself. Building identity is about changing the world. All of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily  how much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves  and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life  Forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right. It only makes what was wrong precious. In January of this year  I went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners  and I was surprised to find them less bitter than I'd anticipated. Most of them had knowingly committed the offenses that landed them in prison  and they had walked in with their heads held high  and they walked out with their heads still held high  many years later. Dr. Ma Thida  a leading human rights activist who had nearly died in prison and had spent many years in solitary confinement  told me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think  for the wisdom she had gained  for the chance to hone her meditation skills. She had sought meaning and made her travail into a crucial identity. But if the people I met were less bitter than I'd anticipated about being in prison  they were also less thrilled than I'd expected about the reform process going on in their country. Ma Thida said   We Burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure  but we also have grievance under glamour   she said   and the fact that there have been these shifts and changes doesn't erase the continuing problems in our society that we learned to see so well while we were in prison.  And I understood her to be saying that concessions confer only a little humanity  where full humanity is due  that crumbs are not the same as a place at the table  which is to say you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell. I've never been raped  and I've never been in anything remotely approaching a Burmese prison  but as a gay American  I've experienced prejudice and even hatred  and I've forged meaning and I've built identity  which is a move I learned from people who had experienced far worse privation than I've ever known. In my own adolescence  I went to extreme lengths to try to be straight. I enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy  in which people I was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises with women I was encouraged to call surrogates  who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else. My particular favorite was a blonde woman from the Deep South who eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac and had taken this job after she got in trouble down at the morgue. These experiences eventually allowed me to have some happy physical relationships with women  for which I'm grateful  but I was at war with myself  and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche. We don't seek the painful experiences that hew our identities  but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences. We cannot bear a pointless torment  but we can endure great pain if we believe that it's purposeful. Ease makes less of an impression on us than struggle. We could have been ourselves without our delights  but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning.  Therefore  I take pleasure in infirmities   St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians   for when I am weak  then I am strong.  In       I went to Moscow to interview artists of the Soviet underground  and I expected their work to be dissident and political. But the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself  as  in some senses  Russian society is now doing again. One of the artists I met said to me   We were in training to be not artists but angels.  In       I went back to see the artists I'd been writing about  and I was with them during the putsch that ended the Soviet Union  and they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch. And on the third day of the putsch  one of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya. And we went there  and we arranged ourselves in front of one of the barricades  and a little while later  a column of tanks rolled up  and the soldier on the front tank said   We have unconditional orders to destroy this barricade. If you get out of the way  we don't need to hurt you  but if you won't move  we'll have no choice but to run you down.  And the artists I was with said   Give us just a minute. Give us just a minute to tell you why we're here.  And the soldier folded his arms  and the artist launched into a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy such as those of us who live in a Jeffersonian democracy would be hard pressed to present. And they went on and on  and the soldier watched  and then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished and looked at us so bedraggled in the rain  and said   What you have said is true  and we must bow to the will of the people. If you'll clear enough space for us to turn around  we'll go back the way we came.  And that's what they did. Sometimes  forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need to fight for your ultimate freedom. Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion that oppression breeds the power to oppose it  and I gradually understood that as the cornerstone of identity. It took identity to rescue me from sadness. The gay rights movement posits a world in which my aberrances are a victory. Identity politics always works on two fronts  to give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic  and to cause the outside world to treat such people more gently and more kindly. Those are two totally separate enterprises  but progress in each sphere reverberates in the other. Identity politics can be narcissistic. People extol a difference only because it's theirs. People narrow the world and function in discrete groups without empathy for one another. But properly understood and wisely practiced  identity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human. Identity itself should be not a smug label or a gold medal but a revolution. I would have had an easier life if I were straight  but I would not be me  and I now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else  someone who  to be honest  I have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine. But if you banish the dragons  you banish the heroes  and we become attached to the heroic strain in our own lives. I've sometimes wondered whether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride's technicolor fiesta  of which this speech is one manifestation. I used to think I would know myself to be mature when I could simply be gay without emphasis  but the self loathing of that period left a void  and celebration needs to fill and overflow it  and even if I repay my private debt of melancholy  there's still an outer world of homophobia that it will take decades to address. Someday  being gay will be a simple fact  free of party hats and blame  but not yet. A friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself  once suggested that we organize Gay Humility Week. It's a great idea  but its time has not yet come. And neutrality  which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration  is actually the endgame. In    states in the U.S.  I could legally be fired or denied housing for being gay. In Russia  the anti propaganda law has led to people being beaten in the streets. Twenty seven African countries have passed laws against sodomy  and in Nigeria  gay people can legally be stoned to death  and lynchings have become common. In Saudi Arabia recently  two men who had been caught in carnal acts  were sentenced to       lashes each  and are now permanently disabled as a result. So who can forge meaning and build identity  Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights  and for the millions who live in unaccepting places with no resources  dignity remains elusive. I am lucky to have forged meaning and built identity  but that's still a rare privilege  and gay people deserve more collectively than the crumbs of justice. And yet  every step forward is so sweet. In       six years after we met  my partner and I decided to get married. Meeting John had been the discovery of great happiness and also the elimination of great unhappiness  and sometimes  I was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain that I forgot about the joy  which was at first the less remarkable part of it to me. Marrying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence. Marriage soon led us to children  and that meant new meanings and new identities  ours and theirs. I want my children to be happy  and I love them most achingly when they are sad. As a gay father  I can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives  but I believe that if I succeed in sheltering them from adversity  I will have failed as a parent. A Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me that Westerners mistakenly think that nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you and you have only bliss to look forward to. But he said that would not be nirvana  because your bliss in the present would always be shadowed by the joy from the past. Nirvana  he said  is what you arrive at when you have only bliss to look forward to and find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy. And I sometimes wonder whether I could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children if they'd come more readily  if I'd been straight in my youth or were young now  in either of which cases this might be easier. Perhaps I could. Perhaps all the complex imagining I've done could have been applied to other topics. But if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning  the question is not whether I'd be happier for having been bullied  but whether assigning meaning to those experiences has made me a better father. I tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys  because I did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me. I know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families  but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh  and gay families so exhilaratingly new  and I found meaning in that surprise. In October  it was my   th birthday  and my family organized a party for me  and in the middle of it  my son said to my husband that he wanted to make a speech  and John said   George  you can't make a speech. You're four.   Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I are going to make speeches tonight.  But George insisted and insisted  and finally  John took him up to the microphone  and George said very loudly   Ladies and gentlemen  may I have your attention please.  And everyone turned around  startled. And George said   I'm glad it's Daddy's birthday. I'm glad we all get cake. And daddy  if you were little  I'd be your friend.  And I thought   Thank you. I thought that I was indebted even to Bobby Finkel  because all those earlier experiences were what had propelled me to this moment  and I was finally unconditionally grateful for a life I'd once have done anything to change. The gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man what he could do to help the movement  and Harvey Milk said   Go out and tell someone.  There's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity  and there are always stories that restore it. If we live out loud  we can trounce the hatred and expand everyone's lives. Forge meaning. Build identity. Forge meaning. Build identity. And then invite the world to share your joy. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  What do augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy  And what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow  Now unfortunately  I'm only going to answer one of those questions today  so please  try and contain your disappointment. When most people think about augmented reality  they think about  Minority Report  and Tom Cruise waving his hands in the air  but augmented reality is not science fiction. Augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime  and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen  and people need to be aware of that  because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone. Now how do we get to augmented reality  Step one is the step I'm wearing right now  Google Glass. I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass. What you may not be familiar with is that Google Glass is a device that will allow you to see what I see. It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field. Right now  the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you. I have to use words. I have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination. With Google Glass  we can put that underneath a helmet  and we can get a sense of what it's like to be running down the field at     miles an hour  your blood pounding in your ears. You can get a sense of what it's like to have a     pound man sprinting at you trying to decapitate you with every ounce of his being. And I've been on the receiving end of that  and it doesn't feel very good. Now  I have some footage to show you of what it's like to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet to give you a taste of that. Unfortunately  it's not NFL practice footage because the NFL thinks emergent technology is what happens when a submarine surfaces  but    Laughter    we do what we can. So let's pull up some video. Ugh  getting tackled sucks. Hold on  let's get a little closer. All right  ready  Go  Chris Kluwe  So as you can see  small taste of what it's like to get tackled on the football field from the perspective of the tacklee. Now  you may have noticed there are some people missing there  the rest of the team. We have some video of that courtesy of the University of Washington. Blue    Blue    Go  Oh  CK  So again  this takes you a little bit closer to what it's like to be on that field  but this is nowhere what it's like to be on the NFL. Fans want that experience. Fans want to be on that field. They want to be their favorite players  and they've already talked to me on YouTube  they've talked to me on Twitter  saying   Hey  can you get this on a quarterback  Can you get this on a running back  We want that experience.  Well  once we have that experience with GoPro and Google Glass  how do we make it more immersive  How do we take that next step  Well  we take that step by going to something called the Oculus Rift  which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with. The Oculus Rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created  and that is not empty hype. I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype with this video. No  No  No  I don't want to play anymore  No  Oh my God  Aaaah  CK  So that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life. What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line  shedding a tackler with a stiff arm before sprinting in for a touchdown  What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when he's Messi sprinting down the pitch putting the ball in the back of the net  or Federer serving in Wimbledon  What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over    miles an hour as an Olympic downhill skier  I think adult diaper sales may surge. But this is not yet augmented reality. This is only virtual reality  V.R. How do we get to augmented reality  A.R.  We get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see  and they say   How do we use this to make our teams better  How do we use this to win games   Because teams always use technology to win games. They like winning. It makes them money. So a brief history of technology in the NFL. In       the Baltimore Colts put a wristband on their quarterback to allow him to call plays quicker. They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year. Other teams followed suit. More people watched the game because it was more exciting. It was faster. In       the NFL put helmet radios into the helmets of the quarterbacks  and later the defense. More people watched games because it was faster. It was more entertaining. In       imagine you're a player walking back to the huddle  and you have your next play displayed right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor that you already wear right now. No more having to worry about forgetting plays. No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook. You just go out and react. And coaches really want this  because missed assignments lose you games  and coaches hate losing games. Losing games gets you fired as a coach. They don't want that. But augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook. Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game. What would that be like  Well  a very simple setup would be a camera on each corner of the stadium looking down  giving you a bird's eye view of all the people down there. You also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers  technology that's being worked on right now. You take all that information  and you stream it to your players. The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use. The bad ones have information overload. That determines good teams from bad. And now  your I.T. department is just as important as your scouting department  and data mining is not for nerds anymore. It's also for jocks. Who knew  What would that look like on the field  Well  imagine you're the quarterback. You take the snap and you drop back. You're scanning downfield for an open receiver. All of a sudden  a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know  blind side linebacker is blitzing in. Normally  you wouldn't be able to see him  but the augmented reality system lets you know. You step up into the pocket. Another flash alerts you to an open receiver. You throw the ball  but you're hit right as you throw. The ball comes off track. You don't know where it's going to land. However  on the receiver's visor  he sees a patch of grass light up  and he knows to readjust. He goes  catches the ball  sprints in  touchdown. Crowd goes wild  and the fans are with him every step of the way  watching from every perspective. Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game. It will make tons of people watch  because people want this experience. Fans want to be on the field. They want to be their favorite player. Augmented reality will be a part of sports  because it's too profitable not to. But the question I ask you is  is that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for  Are we going to use it solely for our panem  our circenses  our entertainment as normal  Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more. I believe we can use augmented reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself  by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person's shoes. We know what this technology is worth to sports leagues. It's worth revenue  to the tune of billions of dollars a year. But what is this technology worth to a teacher in a classroom trying to show a bully just how harmful his actions are from the perspective of the victim  What is this technology worth to a gay Ugandan or Russian trying to show the world what it's like living under persecution  What is this technology worth to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians  Ladies and gentlemen  augmented reality is coming. The questions we ask  the choices we make  and the challenges we face are  as always  up to us. Thank you. I'm excited to be here to speak about vets  because I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war. I didn't join the Army because I had a lust or a need to go overseas and fight. Frankly  I joined the Army because college is really damn expensive  and they were going to help with that  and I joined the Army because it was what I knew  and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well. I didn't come from a military family. I'm not a military brat. No one in my family ever had joined the military at all  and how I first got introduced to the military was when I was    years old and I got sent away to military school  because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since I was eight years old. I had some issues when I was coming up  and my mother would always tell me  she's like   You know  if you don't get this together  I'm going to send you to military school.  And I'd look at her  and I'd say   Mommy  I'll work harder.  And then when I was nine years old  she started giving me brochures to show me she wasn't playing around  so I'd look at the brochures  and I'm like   Okay  Mommy  I can see you're serious  and I'll work harder.  And then when I was    and     my behavior just kept on getting worse. I was on academic and disciplinary probation before I hit double digits  and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists when I was    years old. And so when I was    years old  my mother came up to me  and she was like   I'm not going to do this anymore. I'm going to send you to military school.  And I looked at her  and I said   Mommy  I can see you're upset  and I'm going to work harder.  And she was like   No  you're going next week.  And that was how I first got introduced to this whole idea of the military  because she thought this was a good idea. I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly when I first showed up there  because literally in the first four days  I had already run away five times from this school. They had these big black gates that surrounded the school  and every time they would turn their backs  I would just simply run out of the black gates and take them up on their offer that if we don't want to be there  we can leave at any time. So I just said   Well  if that's the case  then I'd like to leave.   Laughter  And it never worked. And I kept on getting lost. But then eventually  after staying there for a little while  and after the end of that first year at this military school  I realized that I actually was growing up. I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure was something that I'd never found before  the fact that I finally felt like I was part of something bigger  part of a team  and it actually mattered to people that I was there  the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there  but that it was a real  actually core part of the entire experience. And so when it was time for me to actually finish up high school  I started thinking about what I wanted to do  and just like probably most students  had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do. And I thought about the people who I respected and admired. I thought about a lot of the people  in particular a lot of the men  in my life who I looked up to. They all happened to wear the uniform of the United States of America  so for me  the question and the answer really became pretty easy. The question of what I wanted to do was filled in very quickly with saying  I guess I'll be an Army officer. So the Army then went through this process and they trained me up  and when I say I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war  the truth is  I joined in     . There really wasn't a whole lot going on. I didn't ever feel like I was in danger. When I went to my mom  I first joined the Army when I was    years old  so I literally needed parental permission to join the Army  so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom  and she just assumed it was kind of like military school. She was like   Well  it was good for him before  so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it   having no idea that the paperwork that she was signing was actually signing her son up to become an Army officer. And I went through the process  and again the whole time still just thinking  this is great  maybe I'll serve on a weekend  or two weeks during the year  do drill  and then a couple years after I signed up  a couple years after my mother signed those papers  the whole world changed. And after       there was an entirely new context about the occupation that I chose. When I first joined  I never joined to fight  but now that I was in  this is exactly what was now going to happen. And I thought about so much about the soldiers who I eventually had to end up leading. I remember when we first  right after       three weeks after       I was on a plane heading overseas  but I wasn't heading overseas with the military  I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship to go overseas. I received the scholarship to go overseas and to go study and live overseas  and I was living in England and that was interesting  but at the same time  the same people who I was training with  the same soldiers that I went through all my training with  and we prepared for war  they were now actually heading over to it. They were now about to find themselves in the middle of places the fact is the vast majority of people  the vast majority of us as we were training  couldn't even point out on a map. I spent a couple years finishing graduate school  and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there in buildings at Oxford that were literally built hundreds of years before the United States was even founded  and I'm sitting there talking to dons about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand  and how that influenced the start of World War I  where the entire time my heart and my head were on my soldiers who were now throwing on Kevlars and grabbing their flak vests and figuring out how exactly do I change around or how exactly do I clean a machine gun in the darkness. That was the new reality. By the time I finished that up and I rejoined my military unit and we were getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan  there were soldiers in my unit who were now on their second and third deployments before I even had my first. I remember walking out with my unit for the first time  and when you join the Army and you go through a combat tour  everyone looks at your shoulder  because on your shoulder is your combat patch. And so immediately as you meet people  you shake their hand  and then your eyes go to their shoulder  because you want to see where did they serve  or what unit did they serve with  And I was the only person walking around with a bare shoulder  and it burned every time someone stared at it. But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers  and you ask them why did they sign up. I signed up because college was expensive. A lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons. They signed up because of a sense of obligation. They signed up because they were angry and they wanted to do something about it. They signed up because their family said this was important. They signed up because they wanted some form of revenge. They signed for a whole collection of different reasons. And now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts. And what was amazing to me was that I very naively started hearing this statement that I never fully understood  because right after       you start hearing this idea where people come up to you and they say   Well  thank you for your service.  And I just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers. This is even before I deployed. But I really had no idea what that even meant. I just said it because it sounded right. I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say to people who had served overseas.  Thank you for your service.  But I had no idea what the context was or what that even  what it even meant to the people who heard it. When I first came back from Afghanistan  I thought that if you make it back from conflict  then the dangers were all over. I thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone that somehow you could kind of wipe the sweat off your brow and say   Whew  I'm glad I dodged that one   without understanding that for so many people  as they come back home  the war keeps going. It keeps playing out in all of our minds. It plays out in all of our memories. It plays out in all of our emotions. Please forgive us if we don't like being in big crowds. Please forgive us when we spend one week in a place that has     percent light discipline  because you're not allowed to walk around with white lights  because if anything has a white light  it can be seen from miles away  versus if you use little green or little blue lights  they cannot be seen from far away. So please forgive us if out of nowhere  we go from having     percent light discipline to then a week later being back in the middle of Times Square  and we have a difficult time adjusting to that. Please forgive us when you transition back to a family who has completely been maneuvering without you  and now when you come back  it's not that easy to fall back into a sense of normality  because the whole normal has changed. I remember when I came back  I wanted to talk to people. I wanted people to ask me about my experiences. I wanted people to come up to me and tell me   What did you do   I wanted people to come up to me and tell me   What was it like  What was the food like  What was the experience like  How are you doing   And the only questions I got from people was   Did you shoot anybody   And those were the ones who were even curious enough to say anything. Because sometimes there's this fear and there's this apprehension that if I say anything  I'm afraid I'll offend  or I'm afraid I'll trigger something  so the common default is just saying nothing. The problem with that is then it feels like your service was not even acknowledged  like no one even cared.  Thank you for your service   and we move on. What I wanted to better understand was what's behind that  and why  thank you for your service  isn't enough. The fact is  we have literally  .  million men and women who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan who are all amongst us. Sometimes we know who they are  sometimes we don't  but there is that feeling  the shared experience  the shared bond where we know that that experience and that chapter of our life  while it might be closed  it's still not over. We think about  thank you for your service   and people say   So what does 'thank you for your service' mean to you   Well   Thank you for your service  means to me  it means acknowledging our stories  asking us who we are  understanding the strength that so many people  so many people who we serve with  have  and why that service means so much.  Thank you for your service  means acknowledging the fact that just because we've now come home and we've taken off the uniform does not mean our larger service to this country is somehow over. The fact is  there's still a tremendous amount that can be offered and can be given. When I look at people like our friend Taylor Urruela  who in Iraq loses his leg  had two big dreams in his life. One was to be a soldier. The other was to be a baseball player. He loses his leg in Iraq. He comes back and instead of deciding that  well  now since I've lost my leg  that second dream is over  he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball  and he starts this group called VETSports  which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing. People like Tammy Duckworth  who was a helicopter pilot and with the helicopter that she was flying  you need to use both your hands and also your legs to steer  and her helicopter gets hit  and she's trying to steer the chopper  but the chopper's not reacting to her instructions and to her commands. She's trying to land the chopper safely  but the chopper doesn't land safely  and the reason it's not landing safely is because it's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving because her legs were blown off. She barely survives. Medics come and they save her life  but then as she's doing her recuperation back at home  she realizes that   My job's still not done.  And now she uses her voice as a Congresswoman from Illinois to fight and advocate for a collection of issues to include veterans issues. We signed up because we love this country we represent. We signed up because we believe in the idea and we believe in the people to our left and to our right. And the only thing we then ask is that  thank you for your service  needs to be more than just a quote break  that  thank you for your service  means honestly digging in to the people who have stepped up simply because they were asked to  and what that means for us not just now  not just during combat operations  but long after the last vehicle has left and after the last shot has been taken. These are the people who I served with  and these are the people who I honor. So thank you for your service. I'm going to ask and try to answer  in some ways  kind of an uncomfortable question. Both civilians  obviously  and soldiers suffer in war  I don't think any civilian has ever missed the war that they were subjected to. I've been covering wars for almost    years  and one of the remarkable things for me is how many soldiers find themselves missing it. How is it someone can go through the worst experience imaginable  and come home  back to their home  and their family  their country  and miss the war  How does that work  What does it mean  We have to answer that question  because if we don't  it'll be impossible to bring soldiers back to a place in society where they belong  and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war  if we don't understand how that mechanism works. The problem is that war does not have a simple  neat truth  one simple  neat truth. Any sane person hates war  hates the idea of war  wouldn't want to have anything to do with it  doesn't want to be near it  doesn't want to know about it. That's a sane response to war. But if I asked all of you in this room  who here has paid money to go to a cinema and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie  most of you would probably raise your hands. That's what's so complicated about war. And trust me  if a room full of peace loving people finds something compelling about war  so do    year old soldiers who have been trained in it  I promise you. That's the thing that has to be understood. I've covered war for about    years  as I said  but my most intense experiences in combat were with American soldiers in Afghanistan. I've been in Africa  the Middle East  Afghanistan in the '  s  but it was with American soldiers in             that I was confronted with very intense combat. I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley in eastern Afghanistan. It was six miles long. There were     men of Battle Company in that valley  and for a while  while I was there  almost    percent of all the combat in all of Afghanistan was happening in those six miles. A hundred and fifty men were absorbing almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces in the country  for a couple months. It was very intense. I spent most of my time at a small outpost called Restrepo. It was named after the platoon medic that had been killed about two months into the deployment. It was a few plywood B huts clinging to a side of a ridge  and sandbags  bunkers  gun positions  and there were    men up there of Second Platoon  Battle Company. I spent most of my time up there. There was no running water. There was no way to bathe. The guys were up there for a month at a time. They never even got out of their clothes. They fought. The worked. They slept in the same clothes. They never took them off  and at the end of the month  they went back down to the company headquarters  and by then  their clothes were unwearable. They burned them and got a new set. There was no Internet. There was no phone. There was no communication with the outside world up there. There was no cooked food. There was nothing up there that young men typically like  no cars  no girls  no television  nothing except combat. Combat they did learn to like. I remember one day  it was a very hot day in the spring  and we hadn't been in a fight in a couple of weeks  maybe. Usually  the outpost was attacked  and we hadn't seen any combat in a couple of weeks  and everyone was just stunned with boredom and heat. And I remember the lieutenant walking past me sort of stripped to the waist. It was incredibly hot. Stripped to the waist  walked past me muttering   Oh God  please someone attack us today.  That's how bored they were. That's war too  is a lieutenant saying   Please make something happen because we're going crazy.  To understand that  you have to  for a moment  think about combat not morally    that's an important job to do   but for a moment  don't think about it morally  think about it neurologically. Let's think about what happens in your brain when you're in combat. First of all  the experience is very bizarre  it's a very bizarre one. It's not what I had expected. Usually  you're not scared. I've been very scared in combat  but most of the time when I was out there  I wasn't scared. I was very scared beforehand and incredibly scared afterwards  and that fear that comes afterwards can last years. I haven't been shot at in six years  and I was woken up very abruptly this morning by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft  six years later. I've never even been strafed by aircraft  and I was having nightmares about it. Time slows down. You get this weird tunnel vision. You notice some details very  very  very accurately and other things drop out. It's almost a slightly altered state of mind. What's happening in your brain is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline pumped through your system. Young men will go to great lengths to have that experience. It's wired into us. It's hormonally supported. The mortality rate for young men in society is six times what it is for young women from violence and from accidents  just the stupid stuff that young men do  jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of  lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire  I mean  you know what I'm talking about. They die at six times the rate that young women do. Statistically  you are safer as a teenage boy  you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most American cities than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for something to do  statistically. You can imagine how that plays out in combat. At Restrepo  every guy up there was almost killed  including me  including my good friend Tim Hetherington  who was later killed in Libya. There were guys walking around with bullet holes in their uniforms  rounds that had cut through the fabric and didn't touch their bodies. I was leaning against some sandbags one morning  not much going on  sort of spacing out  and some sand was kicked into the side of  sort of hit the side of my face. Something hit the side of my face  and I didn't know what it was. You have to understand about bullets that they go a lot faster than sound  so if someone shoots at you from a few hundred meters  the bullet goes by you  or hits you obviously  half a second or so before the sound catches up to it. So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face. Half a second later  I heard dut dut dut dut duh. It was machine gun fire. It was the first round  the first burst of an hour long firefight. What had happened was the bullet hit  a bullet hit three or four inches from the side of my head. Imagine  just think about it  because I certainly did  think about the angle of deviation that saved my life. At     meters  it missed me by three inches. Just think about the math on that. Every guy up there had some experience like that  at least once  if not many times. The boys are up there for a year. They got back. Some of them got out of the Army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home. Some of them stayed in the Army and were more or less okay  psychologically. I was particularly close to a guy named Brendan O'Byrne. I'm still very good friends with him. He came back to the States. He got out of the Army. I had a dinner party one night. I invited him  and he started talking with a woman  one of my friends  and she knew how bad it had been out there  and she said   Brendan  is there anything at all that you miss about being out in Afghanistan  about the war   And he thought about it quite a long time  and finally he said   Ma'am  I miss almost all of it.  And he's one of the most traumatized people I've seen from that war.  Ma'am  I miss almost all of it.  What is he talking about  He's not a psychopath. He doesn't miss killing people. He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at and seeing his friends get killed. What is it that he misses  We have to answer that. If we're going to stop war  we have to answer that question. I think what he missed is brotherhood. He missed  in some ways  the opposite of killing. What he missed was connection to the other men he was with. Now  brotherhood is different from friendship. Friendship happens in society  obviously. The more you like someone  the more you'd be willing to do for them. Brotherhood has nothing to do with how you feel about the other person. It's a mutual agreement in a group that you will put the welfare of the group  you will put the safety of everyone in the group above your own. In effect  you're saying   I love these other people more than I love myself.  Brendan was a team leader in command of three men  and the worst day in Afghanistan   He was almost killed so many times. It didn't bother him. The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet in the helmet  knocked him over. They thought he was dead. It was in the middle of a huge firefight. No one could deal with it  and a minute later  Kyle Steiner sat back up from the dead  as it were  because he'd come back to consciousness. The bullet had just knocked him out. It glanced off the helmet. He remembers people saying  as he was sort of half conscious  he remembers people saying   Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead.  And he was thinking   I'm not dead.  And he sat up. And Brendan realized after that that he could not protect his men  and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan  was realizing that. That's brotherhood. This wasn't invented recently. Many of you have probably read  The Iliad.  Achilles surely would have risked his life or given his life to save his friend Patroclus. In World War II  there were many stories of soldiers who were wounded  were brought to a rear base hospital  who went AWOL  crawled out of windows  slipped out doors  went AWOL  wounded  to make their way back to the front lines to rejoin their brothers out there. So you think about Brendan  you think about all these soldiers having an experience like that  a bond like that  in a small group  where they loved    other people in some ways more than they loved themselves  you think about how good that would feel  imagine it  and they are blessed with that experience for a year  and then they come home  and they are just back in society like the rest of us are  not knowing who they can count on  not knowing who loves them  who they can love  not knowing exactly what anyone they know would do for them if it came down to it. That is terrifying. Compared to that  war  psychologically  in some ways  is easy  compared to that kind of alienation. That's why they miss it  and that's what we have to understand and in some ways fix in our society. Thank you very much. So it was the fall of       and President Theodore Roosevelt needed a little break from the White House  so he took a train to Mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called Smedes. The first day of the hunt  they didn't see a single bear  so it was a big bummer for everyone  but the second day  the dogs cornered one after a really long chase  but by that point  the president had given up and gone back to camp for lunch  so his hunting guide cracked the animal on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle  and then tied it up to a tree and started tooting away on his bugle to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor of shooting it. The bear was a female. It was dazed  injured  severely underweight  a little mangy looking  and when Roosevelt saw this animal tied up to the tree  he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it. He felt like that would go against his code as a sportsman. A few days later  the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in Washington. It was called  Drawing a Line in Mississippi   and it showed Roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out  sparing the bear's life  and the bear was sitting on its hind legs with these two big  frightened  wide eyes and little ears pricked up at the top of its head. It looked really helpless  like you just wanted to sweep it up into your arms and reassure it. It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time  but if you go looking for the cartoon now  you recognize the animal right away  It's a teddy bear. And this is how the teddy bear was born. Essentially  toymakers took the bear from the cartoon  turned it into a plush toy  and then named it after President Roosevelt    Teddy's bear. And I do feel a little ridiculous that I'm up here on this stage and I'm choosing to use my time to tell you about a     year old story about the invention of a squishy kid's toy  but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear  inside that story is a more important story  a story about how dramatically our ideas about nature can change  and also about how  on the planet right now  the stories that we tell are dramatically changing nature. Because think about the teddy bear. For us  in retrospect  it feels like an obvious fit  because bears are so cute and cuddly  and who wouldn't want to give one to their kids to play with  but the truth is that in       bears weren't cute and cuddly. I mean  they looked the same  but no one thought of them that way. In       bears were monsters. Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids. For generations at that point  the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger that people were encountering on the frontier  and the federal government was actually systematically exterminating bears and lots of other predators too  like coyotes and wolves. These animals  they were being demonized. They were called murderers because they killed people's livestock. One government biologist  he explained this war on animals like the bear by saying that they no longer had a place in our advancing civilization  and so we were just clearing them out of the way. In one    year period  close to half a million wolves had been slaughtered. The grizzly would soon be wiped out from    percent of its original territory  and whereas once there had been    million bison moving across the plains  and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick  living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks  now  by       there were maybe  less than     left in the wild. And so what I'm saying is  the teddy bear was born into the middle of this great spasm of extermination  and you can see it as a sign that maybe some people deep down were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing. America still hated the bear and feared it  but all of a sudden  America also wanted to give the bear a great big hug. So this is something that I've been really curious about in the last few years. How do we imagine animals  how do we think and feel about them  and how do their reputations get written and then rewritten in our minds  We're here living in the eye of a great storm of extinction where half the species on the planet could be gone by the end of the century  and so why is it that we come to care about some of those species and not others  Well  there's a new field  a relatively new field of social science that started looking at these questions and trying to unpack the powerful and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships that we have to animals  and I spent a lot of time looking through their academic journals  and all I can really say is that their findings are astonishingly wide ranging. So some of my favorites include that the more television a person watches in Upstate New York  the more he or she is afraid of being attacked by a black bear. If you show a tiger to an American  they're much more likely to assume that it's female and not male. In a study where a fake snake and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road  drivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle  and about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals seemed to do it on purpose. Women are more likely than men to get a  magical feeling  when they see dolphins in the surf. Sixty eight percent of mothers with  high feelings of entitlement and self esteem  identified with the dancing cats in a commercial for Purina.  Laughter  Americans consider lobsters more important than pigeons but also much  much stupider. Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea otters  and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs. So some of this is physical  right  We tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us  and especially that resemble human babies  so with big  forward facing eyes and circular faces  kind of a roly poly posture. This is why  if you get a Christmas card from  like  your great aunt in Minnesota  there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it  and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider. But it's not all physical  right  There's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals  and we're telling stories about these animals  and like all stories  they are shaped by the times and the places in which we're telling them. So think about that moment back in      again where a ferocious bear became a teddy bear. What was the context  Well  America was urbanizing. For the first time  nearly a majority of people lived in cities  so there was a growing distance between us and nature. There was a safe space where we could reconsider the bear and romanticize it. Nature could only start to seem this pure and adorable because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore. And you can see that cycle playing out again and again with all kinds of animals. It seems like we're always stuck between demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out  and then when we get very close to doing that  empathizing with it as an underdog and wanting to show it compassion. So we exert our power  but then we're unsettled by how powerful we are. So for example  this is one of probably thousands of letters and drawings that kids sent to the Bush administration  begging it to protect the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act  and these were sent back in the mid     s  when awareness of climate change was suddenly surging. We kept seeing that image of a polar bear stranded on a little ice floe looking really morose. I spent days looking through these files. I really love them. This one's my favorite. If you can see  it's a polar bear that's drowning and then it's also being eaten simultaneously by a lobster and a shark. This one came from a kid named Fritz  and he's actually got a solution to climate change. He's got it all worked out to an ethanol based solution. He says   I feel bad about the polar bears. I like polar bears. Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz.  So     years ago  you would have Arctic explorers writing about polar bears leaping into their boats and trying to devour them  even if they lit the bear on fire  but these kids don't see the polar bear that way  and actually they don't even see the polar bear the way that I did back in the '  s. I mean  we thought of these animals as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic. But look now how quickly that climate change has flipped the image of the animal in our minds. It's gone from that bloodthirsty man killer to this delicate  drowning victim  and when you think about it  that's kind of the conclusion to the story that the teddy bear started telling back in       because back then  America had more or less conquered its share of the continent. We were just getting around to polishing off these last wild predators. Now  society's reach has expanded all the way to the top of the world  and it's made even these  the most remote  the most powerful bears on the planet  seem like adorable and blameless victims. But you know  there's also a postscript to the teddy bear story that not a lot of people talk about. We're going to talk about it  because even though it didn't really take long after Roosevelt's hunt in      for the toy to become a full blown craze  most people figured it was a fad  it was a sort of silly political novelty item and it would go away once the president left office  and so by       when Roosevelt's successor  William Howard Taft  was getting ready to be inaugurated  the toy industry was on the hunt for the next big thing. They didn't do too well. That January  Taft was the guest of honor at a banquet in Atlanta  and for days in advance  the big news was the menu. They were going to be serving him a Southern specialty  a delicacy  really  called possum and taters. So you would have a whole opossum roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes  and then sometimes they'd leave the big tail on it like a big  meaty noodle. The one brought to Taft's table weighed    pounds. So after dinner  the orchestra started to play  and the guests burst into song  and all of a sudden  Taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters  and this was a stuffed opossum toy  all beady eyed and bald eared  and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the William Taft presidency's answer to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear. They were calling it the  billy possum.  Within    hours  the Georgia Billy Possum Company was up and running  brokering deals for these things nationwide  and the Los Angeles Times announced  very confidently   The teddy bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear  and for four years  possibly eight  the children of the United States will play with billy possum.  So from that point  there was a fit of opossum fever. There were billy possum postcards  billy possum pins  billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time. There were smaller billy possums on a stick that kids could wave around like flags. But even with all this marketing  the life of the billy possum turned out to be just pathetically brief. The toy was an absolute flop  and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year  and what that means is that the billy possum didn't even make it to Christmastime  which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a toy. So we can explain that failure two ways. The first  well  it's pretty obvious. I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway  Opossums are hideous.  Laughter  But maybe more importantly is that the story of the billy possum was all wrong  especially compared to the backstory of the teddy bear. Think about it  for most of human's evolutionary history  what's made bears impressive to us has been their complete independence from us. It's that they live these parallel lives as menaces and competitors. By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi  that stature was being crushed  and the animal that he had roped to a tree really was a symbol for all bears. Whether those animals lived or died now was entirely up to the compassion or the indifference of people. That said something really ominous about the future of bears  but it also said something very  unsettling about who we'd become  if the survival of even an animal like that was up to us now. So now  a century later  if you're at all paying attention to what's happening in the environment  you feel that discomfort so much more intensely. We're living now in an age of what scientists have started to call  conservation reliance   and what that term means is that we've disrupted so much that nature can't possibly stand on its own anymore  and most endangered species are only going to survive if we stay out there in the landscape riggging the world around them in their favor. So we've gone hands on and we can't ever take our hands off  and that's a hell of a lot of work. Right now  we're training condors not to perch on power lines. We teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter behind little ultra light airplanes. We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets. We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones. So we've gone from annihilating species to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species indefinitely  and which ones  Well  the ones that we've told compelling stories about  the ones we've decided ought to stick around. The line between conservation and domestication is blurred. So what I've been saying is that the stories that we tell about wild animals are so subjective they can be irrational or romanticized or sensationalized. Sometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts. But in a world of conservation reliance  those stories have very real consequences  because now  how we feel about an animal affects its survival more than anything that you read about in ecology textbooks. Storytelling matters now. Emotion matters. Our imagination has become an ecological force. And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part because the legend of Roosevelt and that bear in Mississippi was kind of like an allegory of this great responsibility that society was just beginning to face up to back then. It would be another    years before the Endangered Species Act was passed  but really  here's its whole ethos boiled down into something like a scene you'd see in a stained glass window. The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree  and the president of the United States decided to show it some mercy. Thank you.  Illustrations by Wendy MacNaughton  As a little girl  I always imagined I would one day run away. From the age of six on  I kept a packed bag with some clothes and cans of food tucked away in the back of a closet. There was a deep restlessness in me  a primal fear that I would fall prey to a life of routine and boredom. And so  many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where I would walk across borders  forage for berries  and meet all kinds of strange people living unconventional lives on the road. Years have passed  but many of the adventures I fantasized about as a child    traveling and weaving my way between worlds other than my own   have become realities through my work as a documentary photographer. But no other experience has felt as true to my childhood dreams as living amongst and documenting the lives of fellow wanderers across the United States. This is the nomadic dream  a different kind of American dream lived by young hobos  travelers  hitchhikers  vagrants and tramps. In most of our minds  the vagabond is a creature from the past. The word  hobo  conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal  legs dangling out of a boxcar  but these photographs are in color  and they portray a community swirling across the country  fiercely alive and creatively free  seeing sides of America that no one else gets to see. Like their predecessors  today's nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the United States. By day  they hop freight trains  stick out their thumbs  and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms. By night  they sleep beneath the stars  huddled together with their packs of dogs  cats and pet rats between their bodies. Some travelers take to the road by choice  renouncing materialism  traditional jobs and university degrees in exchange  for a glimmer of adventure. Others come from the underbelly of society  never given a chance to mobilize upwards  foster care dropouts  teenage runaways escaping abuse and unforgiving homes. Where others see stories of privation and economic failure  travelers view their own existence through the prism of liberation and freedom. They'd rather live off of the excess of what they view as a wasteful consumer society than slave away at an unrealistic chance at the traditional American dream. They take advantage of the fact that in the United States  up to    percent of all food ends up in the garbage by scavenging for perfectly good produce in dumpsters and trash cans. They sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space and the time to explore a creative interior  to dream  to read  to work on music  art and writing. But there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic. No one loses their inner demons by taking to the road. Addiction is real  the elements are real  freight trains maim and kill  and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest to the exhaustive list of laws that criminalize homeless existence. Who here knows that in many cities across the United States it is now illegal to sit on the sidewalk  to wrap oneself in a blanket  to sleep in your own car  to offer food to a stranger  I know about these laws because I've watched as friends and other travelers were hauled off to jail or received citations for committing these so called crimes. Many of you might be wondering why anyone would choose a life like this  under the thumb of discriminatory laws  eating out of trash cans  sleeping under bridges  picking up seasonal jobs here and there. The answer to such a question is as varied as the people that take to the road  but travelers often respond with a single word  freedom. Until we live in a society where every human is assured dignity in their labor so that they can work to live well  not only work to survive  there will always be an element of those who seek the open road as a means of escape  of liberation and  of course  of rebellion. Thank you. Approximately    years ago  when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia  a father and a son walked into my office and they both had their right eye missing  and as I took the history  it became apparent that the father and the son had a rare form of inherited eye tumor  retinoblastoma  and the father knew that he had passed that fate on to his son. That moment changed my life. It propelled me to go on and to co lead a team that discovered the first cancer susceptibility gene  and in the intervening decades since then  there has been literally a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on  what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases. In fact  for thousands of human traits  a molecular basis that's known for that  and for thousands of people  every day  there's information that they gain about the risk of going on to get this disease or that disease. At the same time  if you ask   Has that impacted the efficiency  how we've been able to develop drugs   the answer is not really. If you look at the cost of developing drugs  how that's done  it basically hasn't budged that. And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose yet not the power to fully treat. And there are two commonly given reasons for why that happens. One of them is it's early days. We're just learning the words  the fragments  the letters in the genetic code. We don't know how to read the sentences. We don't know how to follow the narrative. The other reason given is that most of those changes are a loss of function  and it's actually really hard to develop drugs that restore function. But today  I want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question  and ask   What happens if we're thinking about this maybe in the wrong context   We do a lot of studying of those who are sick and building up long lists of altered components. But maybe  if what we're trying to do is to develop therapies for prevention  maybe what we should be doing is studying those who don't get sick. Maybe we should be studying those that are well. A vast majority of those people are not necessarily carrying a particular genetic load or risk factor. They're not going to help us. There are going to be those individuals who are carrying a potential future risk  they're going to go on to get some symptom. That's not what we're looking for. What we're asking and looking for is  are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the risk that normally would cause a disease  but something in them  something hidden in them is actually protective and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms  If you're going to do a study like that  you can imagine you'd like to look at lots and lots of people. We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study  and we realized that actually one way to think of this is  let us look at adults who are over    years of age  and let's make sure that we look at those who were healthy as kids. They might have had individuals in their families who had had a childhood disease  but not necessarily. And let's go and then screen those to find those who are carrying genes for childhood diseases. Now  some of you  I can see you putting your hands up going   Uh  a little odd. What's your evidence that this could be feasible   I want to give you two examples. The first comes from San Francisco. It comes from the     s and the     s  and you may know the story where there were individuals who had very high levels of the virus HIV. They went on to get AIDS. But there was a very small set of individuals who also had very high levels of HIV. They didn't get AIDS. And astute clinicians tracked that down  and what they found was they were carrying mutations. Notice  they were carrying mutations from birth that were protective  that were protecting them from going on to get AIDS. You may also know that actually a line of therapy has been coming along based on that fact. Second example  more recent  is elegant work done by Helen Hobbs  who said   I'm going to look at individuals who have very high lipid levels  and I'm going to try to find those people with high lipid levels who don't go on to get heart disease.  And again  what she found was some of those individuals had mutations that were protective from birth that kept them  even though they had high lipid levels  and you can see this is an interesting way of thinking about how you could develop preventive therapies. The project that we're working on is called  The Resilience Project  A Search for Unexpected Heroes   because what we are interested in doing is saying  can we find those rare individuals who might have these hidden protective factors  And in some ways  think of it as a decoder ring  a sort of resilience decoder ring that we're going to try to build. We've realized that we should  do this in a systematic way  so we've said  let's take every single childhood inherited disease. Let's take them all  and let's pull them back a little bit by those that are known to have severe symptoms  where the parents  the child  those around them would know that they'd gotten sick  and let's go ahead and then frame them again by those parts of the genes where we know that there is a particular alteration that is known to be highly penetrant to cause that disease. Where are we going to look  Well  we could look locally. That makes sense. But we began to think  maybe we should look all over the world. Maybe we should look not just here but in remote places where their might be a distinct genetic context  there might be environmental factors that protect people. And let's look at a million individuals. Now the reason why we think it's a good time to do that now is  in the last couple of years  there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost to do this type of analysis  this type of data generation  to where it actually costs less to do the data generation and analysis than it does to do the sample processing and the collection. The other reason is that in the last five years  there have been awesome tools  things about network biology  systems biology  that have come up that allow us to think that maybe we could decipher those positive outliers. And as we went around talking to researchers and institutions and telling them about our story  something happened. They started saying   This is interesting. I would be glad to join your effort. I would be willing to participate.  And they didn't say   Where's the MTA   They didn't say   Where is my authorship   They didn't say   Is this data going  to be mine  Am I going to own it   They basically said   Let's work on this in an open  crowd sourced  team way to do this decoding.  Six months ago  we locked down the screening key for this decoder. My co lead  a brilliant scientist  Eric Schadt at the Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  and his team  locked in that decoder key ring  and we began looking for samples  because what we realized is  maybe we could just go and look at some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility. Maybe we could take two  three  percent of the project on  and see if it was there. And so we started asking people such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. We asked Leif up in Finland. We talked to Anne Wojcicki at   andMe  and Wang Jun at BGI  and again  something remarkable happened. They said   Huh  not only do we have samples  but often we've analyzed them  and we would be glad to go into our anonymized samples and see if we could find those that you're looking for.  And instead of being        or         last month we passed one half million samples that we've already analyzed. So you must be going   Huh  did you find any unexpected heroes   And the answer is  we didn't find one or two. We found dozens of these strong candidate unexpected heroes. So we think that the time is now to launch the beta phase of this project and actually start getting prospective individuals. Basically all we need is information. We need a swab of DNA and a willingness to say   What's inside me  I'm willing to be re contacted.  Most of us spend our lives  when it comes to health and disease  acting as if we're voyeurs. We delegate the responsibility for the understanding of our disease  for the treatment of our disease  to anointed experts. In order for us to get this project to work  we need individuals to step up in a different role and to be engaged  to realize this dream  this open crowd sourced project  to find those unexpected heroes  to evolve from the current concepts of resources and constraints  to design those preventive therapies  and to extend it beyond childhood diseases  to go all the way up to ways that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's  we're going to need us to be looking inside ourselves and asking   What are our roles  What are our genes   and looking within ourselves for information we used to say we should go to the outside  to experts  and to be willing to share that with others. Thank you very much.   It's all there in gospels    A Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects     But her mind is awhirl     When she finds the tomb empty     Straw had been rolled     Not a sign of a corpse     In the dark and the cold     When she reaches the door     Sees an unholy sight     There's a solitary figure and a halo of light     He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill     In an Almighty hurry     Aye  but she might catch him still     Tell me where are you gone  Lord     And why in such haste      Oh don't hinder me  woman     I've no time to waste     For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon     And I have to be there before daybreak     Oh I cannot be missing     The lads'll expect me     Why else would the Good Lord Himself resurrect me      For nothing'll stop me. I have to prevail     Through the teeth of this tempest     In the mouth of a gale     May the angels protect me     If all else should fail     And the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails   So I was born and raised in the shadow of a shipyard in a little town on the northeast coast of England. Some of my earliest memories are of giant ships blocking the end of my street  as well as the sun  for a lot of the year. Every morning as a child  I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill to work in the shipyard. I'd watch those same men walking back home every night. It has to be said  the shipyard was not the most pleasant place to live next door to  or indeed work in. The shipyard was noisy  dangerous  highly toxic  with an appalling health and safety record. Despite that  the men and women who worked on those ships were extraordinarily proud of the work they did  and justifiably so. Some of the largest vessels ever constructed on planet Earth were built right at the end of my street. My grandfather had been a shipwright  and as a child  as there were few other jobs in the town  I would wonder with some anxiety whether that would be my destiny too. I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be. I had other dreams  not necessarily practical ones  but at the age of eight  I was bequeathed a guitar. It was a battered old thing with five rusty strings  and was out of tune  but quickly I learned to play it and realized that I'd found a friend for life  an accomplice  a co conspirator in my plan to escape from this surreal industrial landscape. Well  they say if you dream something hard enough  it will come to pass. Either that  or I was extremely lucky  but this was my dream. I dreamt I would leave this town  and just like those ships  once they were launched  I'd never come back. I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs  that I would sing those songs to vast numbers of people all over the world  that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money  that I'd become famous  that I'd marry a beautiful woman  have children  raise a family  buy a big house in the country  keep dogs  grow wine  have rooms full of Grammy Awards  platinum discs  and what have you. So far  so good  right   Laughter  And then one day  the songs stopped coming  and while you've suffered from periods of writer's block before  albeit briefly  this is something chronic. Day after day  you face a blank page  and nothing's coming. And those days turned to weeks  and weeks to months  and pretty soon those months have turned into years with very little to show for your efforts. No songs. So you start asking yourself questions. What have I done to offend the gods that they would abandon me so  Is the gift of songwriting taken away as easily as it seems to have been bestowed  Or perhaps there's a more    a deeper psychological reason. It was always a Faustian pact anyway. You're rewarded for revealing your innermost thoughts  your private emotions on the page for the entertainment of others  for the analysis  the scrutiny of others  and perhaps you've given enough of your privacy away. And yet  if you look at your work  could it be argued that your best work wasn't about you at all  it was about somebody else  Did your best work occur when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story  but told someone else's story  someone perhaps without a voice  where empathetically  you stood in his shoes for a while or saw the world through his eyes  Well they say  write what you know. If you can't write about yourself anymore  then who do you write about  So it's ironic that the landscape I'd worked so hard to escape from  and the community that I'd more or less abandoned and exiled myself from should be the very landscape  the very community I would have to return to to find my missing muse. And as soon as I did that  as soon as I decided to honor the community I came from and tell their story  that the songs started to come thick and fast. I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting  a torrent of ideas  of characters  of voices  of verses  couplets  entire songs almost formed whole  materialized in front of me as if they'd been bottled up inside me for many  many years. One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names of people I'd known  and they become characters in a kind of three dimensional drama  where they explain who they are  what they do  their hopes and their fears for the future. This is Jackie White. He's the foreman of the shipyard. My name is Jackie White  and I'm foreman of the yard  and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside. I'm as hard as iron plate  woe betide you if you're late when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide. Now you can die and hope for heaven  but you need to work your shift  and I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt  for if St. Peter at his gate were to ask you why you're late  why  you tell him that you had to get a ship built. We build battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen  supertankers for Onassis  and all the classes in between  We built the greatest ship in tonnage what the world has ever seen   And the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard     Steel in the stockyard  iron in the soul     Would conjure up a ship     Where there used to be a hull     And we don't know what we'll do     If this yard gets sold     For the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard   So having decided to write about other people instead of myself  a further irony is that sometimes you reveal more about yourself than you'd ever intended. This song is called  Dead Man's Boots   which is an expression which describes how difficult it is to get a job  in other words  you'd only get a job in the shipyard if somebody else died. Or perhaps your father could finagle you an apprenticeship at the age of   . But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued as controlling  and conversely  the scope of his son's ambition can seem like some pie in the sky fantasy.   You see these work boots in my hands     They'll probably fit you now  my son     Take them  they're a gift from me     Why don't you try them on      It would do your old man good to see     You walking in these boots one day     And take your place among the men     Who work upon the slipway     These dead man's boots  though they're old and curled     When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world     And it's time for a man to put down roots     And walk to the river in his old man's boots     He said   I'm dying  son  and asking     That you do one final thing for me     You're barely but a sapling  and you think that you're a tree     If you need a seed to prosper     You must first put down some roots     Just one foot then the other in     These dead man's boots      These dead man's boots  though they're old and curled     When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world     And it's time for a man to put down roots     And walk to the river in his old man's boots     I said   Why in the hell would I do that      Why would I agree       When his hand was all that I'd received     As far as I remember     It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness     Up to then  you see     I'd a plan of my own and I'd quit this place     When I came of age September     These dead man's boots know their way down the hill     They could walk there themselves  and they probably will     I've plenty of choices  I've plenty other routes     And you'll never see me walking in these dead man's boots     What was it made him think     I'd be happy ending up like him     When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left     Or a broken pot to piss in      He wanted this same thing for me     Was that his final wish      He said   What the hell are you gonna do       I said   Anything but this       These dead man's boots know their way down the hill     They can walk there themselves and they probably will     But they won't walk with me  cause I'm off the other way     I've had it up to here  I'm gonna have my say     When all you've got left is that cross on the wall     I want nothing from you  I want nothing at all     Not a pension  nor a pittance  when your whole life is through     Get this through your head  I'm nothing like you     I'm done with all the arguments  there'll be no more disputes     And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots   Thank you. So whenever they'd launch a big ship  they would invite some dignitary up from London on the train to make a speech  break a bottle of champagne over the bows  launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea. Occasionally on a really important ship  they'd get a member of the royal family to come  Duke of Edinburgh  Princess Anne or somebody. And you have to remember  it wasn't that long ago that the royal family in England were considered to have magical healing powers. Sick children were held up in crowds to try and touch the cloak of the king or the queen to cure them of some terrible disease. It wasn't like that in my day  but we still got very excited. So it's a launch day  it's a Saturday  and my mother has dressed me up in my Sunday best. I'm not very happy with her. All the kids are out in the street  and we have little Union Jacks to wave  and at the top of the hill  there's a motorcycle cortege appears. In the middle of the motorcycles  there's a big  black Rolls Royce. Inside the Rolls Royce is the Queen Mother. This is a big deal. So the procession is moving at a stately pace down my street  and as it approaches my house  I start to wave my flag vigorously  and there is the Queen Mother. I see her  and she seems to see me. She acknowledges me. She waves  and she smiles. And I wave my flag even more vigorously. We're having a moment  me and the Queen Mother. She's acknowledged me. And then she's gone. Well  I wasn't cured of anything. It was the opposite  actually. I was infected. I was infected with an idea. I don't belong in this street. I don't want to live in that house. I don't want to end up in that shipyard. I want to be in that car.  Laughter  I want a bigger life. I want a life beyond this town. I want a life that's out of the ordinary. It's my right. It's my right as much as hers. And so here I am at TED  I suppose to tell that story  and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link between storytelling and community  between community and art  between community and science and technology  between community and economics. It's my belief that abstract economic theory that denies the needs of community or denies the contribution that community makes to economy is shortsighted  cruel and untenable. The fact is  whether you're a rock star or whether you're a welder in a shipyard  or a tribesman in the upper Amazon  or the queen of England  at the end of the day  we're all in the same boat.   Aye  the footmen are frantic in their indignation     You see the queen's took a taxi herself to the station     Where the porters  surprised by her lack of royal baggage     Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage     For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility     And there's none of them famous for their compatibility     There's a fight over seats      I beg pardon  Your Grace     But you'll find that one's mine  so get back in your place        Aye  but where are they going       All the porters debate      Why they're going to Newcastle and they daren't be late     For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide     And they've come from all over  from far and from wide      There's the old Dalai Lama     And the pontiff of Rome     Every palace in Europe  and there's nay bugger home     There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales     Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails     Well  they haven't got tickets     Come now  it's just a detail     There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail     For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail      When the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails     And whatever you'd promised     Whatever you've done     And whatever the station in life you've become     In the name of the Father  in the name of the Son     And no matter the weave of this life that you've spun     On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun     When the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails   Thanks very much for listening to my song. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Okay  you have to join in if you know it.   Just a castaway     An island lost at sea  oh     Another lonely day     With no one here but me  oh     More loneliness than any man could bear     Rescue me before I fall into despair     I'll send an S.O.S. to the world     I'll send an S.O.S. to the world     I hope that someone gets my     I hope that someone gets my     I hope that someone gets my     Message in a bottle     Message in a bottle     A year has passed since I wrote my note     I should have known this right from the start     Only hope can keep me together     Love can mend your life     but love can break your heart     I'll send an S.O.S. to the world     I'll send an S.O.S. to the world     I hope that someone gets my     I hope that someone gets my     I hope that someone gets my     Message in a bottle     Message in a bottle     Message in a bottle     Message in a bottle     Walked out this morning     I don't believe what I saw     A hundred billion bottles     Washed up on the shore     Seems I'm not alone in being alone     A hundred billion castaways     Looking for a home     I'll send an S.O.S. to the world     I'll send an S.O.S. to the world     I hope that someone gets my     I hope that someone gets my     I hope that someone gets my     Message in a bottle     Message in a bottle     Message in a bottle     Message in a bottle   So I'm going to ask you to sing after me  okay  the next part.

It's a story of the neocortex  which means  new rind.  So in these early mammals  because only mammals have a neocortex  rodent like creatures. It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin  and was a thin covering around their walnut sized brain  but it was capable of a new type of thinking. Rather than the fixed behaviors that non mammalian animals have  it could invent new behaviors. So a mouse is escaping a predator  its path is blocked  it'll try to invent a new solution. That may work  it may not  but if it does  it will remember that and have a new behavior  and that can actually spread virally through the rest of the community. Another mouse watching this could say   Hey  that was pretty clever  going around that rock   and it could adopt a new behavior as well. Non mammalian animals couldn't do any of those things. They had fixed behaviors. Now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course of one lifetime. In the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes  it could evolve a new fixed behavior. That was perfectly okay     million years ago. The environment changed very slowly. It could take        years for there to be a significant environmental change  and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior. Now that went along fine  but then something happened. Sixty five million years ago  there was a sudden  violent change to the environment. We call it the Cretaceous extinction event. That's when the dinosaurs went extinct  that's when    percent of the animal and plant species went extinct  and that's when mammals overtook their ecological niche  and to anthropomorphize  biological evolution said   Hmm  this neocortex is pretty good stuff   and it began to grow it. And mammals got bigger  their brains got bigger at an even faster pace  and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area. If you took the human neocortex and stretched it out  it's about the size of a table napkin  and it's still a thin structure. It's about the thickness of a table napkin. But it has so many convolutions and ridges it's now    percent of our brain  and that's where we do our thinking  and it's the great sublimator. We still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations  but I may have a drive for conquest  and that'll be sublimated by the neocortex into writing a poem or inventing an app or giving a TED Talk  and it's really the neocortex that's where the action is. Fifty years ago  I wrote a paper describing how I thought the brain worked  and I described it as a series of modules. Each module could do things with a pattern. It could learn a pattern. It could remember a pattern. It could implement a pattern. And these modules were organized in hierarchies  and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking. And there was actually very little to go on    years ago. It led me to meet President Johnson. I've been thinking about this for    years  and a year and a half ago I came out with the book  How To Create A Mind   which has the same thesis  but now there's a plethora of evidence. The amount of data we're getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year. Spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types is doubling every year. We can now see inside a living brain and see individual interneural connections connecting in real time  firing in real time. We can see your brain create your thoughts. We can see your thoughts create your brain  which is really key to how it works. So let me describe briefly how it works. I've actually counted these modules. We have about     million of them  and we create them in these hierarchies. I'll give you a simple example. I've got a bunch of modules that can recognize the crossbar to a capital A  and that's all they care about. A beautiful song can play  a pretty girl could walk by  they don't care  but they see a crossbar to a capital A  they get very excited and they say  crossbar   and they put out a high probability on their output axon. That goes to the next level  and these layers are organized in conceptual levels. Each is more abstract than the next one  so the next one might say  capital A.  That goes up to a higher level that might say  Apple.  Information flows down also. If the apple recognizer has seen A P P L  it'll think to itself   Hmm  I think an E is probably likely   and it'll send a signal down to all the E recognizers saying   Be on the lookout for an E  I think one might be coming.  The E recognizers will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing  could be an E. Ordinarily you wouldn't think so  but we're expecting an E  it's good enough  and yeah  I've seen an E  and then apple says   Yeah  I've seen an Apple.  Go up another five levels  and you're now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy  and stretch down into the different senses  and you may have a module that sees a certain fabric  hears a certain voice quality  smells a certain perfume  and will say   My wife has entered the room.  Go up another    levels  and now you're at a very high level. You're probably in the frontal cortex  and you'll have modules that say   That was ironic. That's funny. She's pretty.  You might think that those are more sophisticated  but actually what's more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them. There was a    year old girl  she had brain surgery  and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her. You can do that because there's no pain receptors in the brain. And whenever they stimulated particular  very small points on her neocortex  shown here in red  she would laugh. So at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex  but no  they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor  and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points.  You guys are so funny just standing around   was the typical comment  and they weren't funny  not while doing surgery. So how are we doing today  Well  computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex. I actually described the algorithm  which is similar to something called a hierarchical hidden Markov model  something I've worked on since the '  s.  Jeopardy  is a very broad natural language game  and Watson got a higher score than the best two players combined. It got this query correct   A long  tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping   and it quickly responded   What is a meringue harangue   And Jennings and the other guy didn't get that. It's a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language  and it actually got its knowledge by reading Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias. Five to    years from now  search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding  reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books. So you'll be walking along  and Google will pop up and say   You know  Mary  you expressed concern to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement wasn't getting past the blood brain barrier. Well  new research just came out    seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione. Let me summarize it for you.  Twenty years from now  we'll have nanobots  because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology. They'll go into our brain through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud providing an extension of our neocortex. Now today  I mean  you have a computer in your phone  but if you need        computers for a few seconds to do a complex search  you can access that for a second or two in the cloud. In the     s  if you need some extra neocortex  you'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain. So I'm walking along and I say   Oh  there's Chris Anderson. He's coming my way. I'd better think of something clever to say. I've got three seconds. My     million modules in my neocortex isn't going to cut it. I need a billion more.  I'll be able to access that in the cloud. And our thinking  then  will be a hybrid of biological and non biological thinking  but the non biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns. It will grow exponentially. And remember what happens the last time we expanded our neocortex  That was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads. Other primates have a slanted brow. They don't have the frontal cortex. But the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different. It's a quantitative expansion of neocortex  but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap and invent language and art and science and technology and TED conferences. No other species has done that. And so  over the next few decades  we're going to do it again. We're going to again expand our neocortex  only this time we won't be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure. It'll be expanded without limit. That additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology. Thank you very much. At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we're going to become  and then when we become those people  we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. Middle aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work hard to lose what middle aged adults worked hard to gain. On and on and on. The question is  as a psychologist  that fascinates me is  why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret  Now  I think one of the reasons    I'll try to convince you today   is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time. Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan  that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year. But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl  Is it teenage years  Is it middle age  Is it old age  The answer  it turns out  for most people  is now  wherever now happens to be. What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion  an illusion that history  our personal history  has just come to an end  that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. Let me give you some data to back up that claim. So here's a study of change in people's personal values over time. Here's three values. Everybody here holds all of them  but you probably know that as you grow  as you age  the balance of these values shifts. So how does it do so  Well  we asked thousands of people. We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next    years  and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last    years. And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis  because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people  say     years old  to the reports of people who were     and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan. Here's what we found. First of all  you are right  change does slow down as we age  but second  you're wrong  because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think. At every age  from    to    in our data set  people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next    years. We call this the  end of history  illusion. To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect  you can connect these two lines  and what you see here is that    year olds anticipate changing only as much as    year olds actually do. Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things. For example  personality. Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality  neuroticism  openness to experience  agreeableness  extraversion  and conscientiousness. Again  we asked people how much they expected to change over the next    years  and also how much they had changed over the last    years  and what we found  well  you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over  because once again the rate of change does slow as we age  but at every age  people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade. And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality. You can ask people about their likes and dislikes  their basic preferences. For example  name your best friend  your favorite kind of vacation  what's your favorite hobby  what's your favorite kind of music. People can name these things. We ask half of them to tell us   Do you think that that will change over the next    years   and half of them to tell us   Did that change over the last    years   And what we find  well  you've seen it twice now  and here it is again  people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in    years  the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in    years  and yet  people who are    years older all say   Eh  you know  that's really changed.  Does any of this matter  Is this just a form of mis prediction that doesn't have consequences  No  it matters quite a bit  and I'll give you an example of why. It bedevils our decision making in important ways. Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician    years ago. I put mine up on the screen to help you along. Now we asked people to predict for us  to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert    years from now  and on average  people said they would pay     dollars for that ticket. And yet  when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite    years ago perform today  they say only    dollars. Now  in a perfectly rational world  these should be the same number  but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability. Why does this happen  We're not entirely sure  but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining. Most of us can remember who we were    years ago  but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be  and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine  it's not likely to happen. Sorry  when people say  I can't imagine that   they're usually talking about their own lack of imagination  and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they're describing. The bottom line is  time is a powerful force. It transforms our preferences. It reshapes our values. It alters our personalities. We seem to appreciate this fact  but only in retrospect. Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade. It's as if  for most of us  the present is a magic time. It's a watershed on the timeline. It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves. Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished. The person you are right now is as transient  as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. The one constant in our life is change. Thank you. I read poetry all the time and write about it frequently and take poems apart to see how they work because I'm a word person. I understand the world best  most fully  in words rather than  say  pictures or numbers  and when I have a new experience or a new feeling  I'm a little frustrated until I can try to put it into words. I think I've always been that way. I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do. And I found poems by Andrew Marvell and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson and William Butler Yeats because they were quoted in science fiction  and I loved their sounds and I went on to read about ottava rima and medial caesuras and enjambment and all that other technical stuff that you care about if you already care about poems  because poems already made me happier and sadder and more alive. And I became a poetry critic because I wanted to know how and why. Now  poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose any more than music or computer programming serve one purpose. The greek word poem  it just means  a made thing   and poetry is a set of techniques  ways of making patterns that put emotions into words. The more techniques you know  the more things you can make  and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love. That said  poetry does seem to be especially good at certain things. For example  we are all going to die. Poetry can help us live with that. Poems are made of words  nothing but words. The particulars in poems are like the particularities  the personalities  that distinguish people from one another. Poems are easy to share  easy to pass on  and when you read a poem  you can imagine someone's speaking to you or for you  maybe even someone far away or someone made up or someone deceased. That's why we can go to poems when we want to remember something or someone  to celebrate or to look beyond death or to say goodbye  and that's one reason poems can seem important  even to people who aren't me  who don't so much live in a world of words. The poet Frank O'Hara said   If you don't need poetry  bully for you   but he also said when he didn't want to be alive anymore  the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems had stopped him. Poetry helps me want to be alive  and I want to show you why by showing you how  how a couple of poems react to the fact that we're alive in one place at one time in one culture  and in another we won't be alive at all. So here's one of the first poems I memorized. It could address a child or an adult.  From far  from eve and morning From yon twelve winded sky  The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither  here am I. Now   for a breath I tarry Nor yet disperse apart   Take my hand quick and tell me  What have you in your heart. Speak now  and I will answer  How shall I help you  say  Ere to the wind's twelve quarters I take my endless way.   A. E. Housman  Now  this poem has appealed to science fiction writers. It's furnished at least three science fiction titles  I think because it says poems can brings us news from the future or the past or across the world  because their patterns can seem to tell you what's in somebody's heart. It says poems can bring people together temporarily  which I think is true  and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes  cleanly and simply on the two and four   say  and  way   with anticipatory hints on the one and three   answer  and  quarters   as if the poem itself were coming together. It plays up the fact that we die by exaggerating the speed of our lives. A few years on Earth become one speech  one breath. It's a poem about loneliness    the  I  in the poem feels no connection will last   and it might look like a plea for help 'til you get to the word  help   where this  I  facing you  taking your hand  is more like a teacher or a genie  or at least that's what he wants to believe. It would not be the first time a poet had written the poem that he wanted to hear. Now  this next poem really changed what I liked and what I read and what I felt I could read as an adult. It might not make any sense to you if you haven't seen it before.  The Garden   Oleander  coral from lipstick ads in the   's. Fruit of the tree of such knowledge To smack  thin air  meaning kiss or hit. It appears in the guise of outworn usages because we are bad  Big masculine threat  insinuating and slangy.   Rae Armantrout  Now  I found this poem in an anthology of almost equally confusing poems in     . I just heard that there were these scandalous writers called Language poets who didn't make any sense  and I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like  and some of them didn't do much for me  but this writer  Rae Armantrout  did an awful lot  and I kept reading her until I felt I knew what was going on  as I do with this poem. It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall and the Biblical story of the Fall  in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time. It's also about how appearances deceive  how our culture can sweep us along into doing and saying things we didn't intend or don't like  and Armantrout's style is trying to help us stop or slow down.  Smack  can mean  kiss  as in air kisses  as in lip smacking  but that can lead to  smack  as in  hit  as in domestic abuse  because sexual attraction can seem threatening. The red that means fertility can also mean poison. Oleander is poisonous. And outworn usages like  smack  for  kiss  or  hit  can help us see how our unacknowledged assumptions can make us believe we are bad  either because sex is sinful or because we tolerate so much sexism. We let guys tell women what to do. The poem reacts to old lipstick ads  and its edginess about statement  its reversals and halts  have everything to do with resisting the language of ads that want to tell us so easily what to want  what to do  what to think. That resistance is a lot of the point of the poem  which shows me  Armantrout shows me what it's like to hear grave threats and mortal dishonesty in the language of everyday life  and once she's done that  I think she can show other people  women and men  what it's like to feel that way and say to other people  women and men who feel so alienated or so threatened that they're not alone. Now  how do I know that I'm right about this somewhat confusing poem  Well in this case  I emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said   Yeah  yeah  that's about it.  Yeah.  Laughter   Applause  But usually  you can't know. You never know. You can't be sure  and that's okay. All we can do we is listen to poems and look at poems and guess and see if they can bring us what we need  and if you're wrong about some part of a poem  nothing bad will happen. Now  this next poem is older than Armantrout's  but a little younger than A. E. Housman's.  The Brave Man   The sun  that brave man  Comes through boughs that lie in wait  That brave man. Green and gloomy eyes In dark forms of the grass Run away. The good stars  Pale helms and spiky spurs  Run away. Fears of my bed  Fears of life and fears of death  Run away. That brave man comes up From below and walks without meditation  That brave man.   Wallace Stevens  Now  the sun in this poem  in Wallace Stevens' poem  seems so grave because the person in the poem is so afraid. The sun comes up in the morning through branches  dispels the dew  the eyes  on the grass  and defeats stars envisioned as armies.  Brave  has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense  courage. This sun is not afraid to show his face. But the person in the poem is afraid. He might have been up all night. That is the reveal Stevens saves for that fourth stanza  where run away has become a refrain. This person might want to run away too  but fortified by the sun's example  he might just rise. Stevens saves that sonically odd word  meditation  for the end. Unlike the sun  human beings think. We meditate on past and future  life and death  above and below. And it can make us afraid. Poems  the patterns in poems  show us not just what somebody thought or what someone did or what happened but what it was like to be a person like that  to be so anxious  so lonely  so inquisitive  so goofy  so preposterous  so brave. That's why poems can seem at once so durable  so personal  and so ephemeral  like something inside and outside you at once. The Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry to a needle  a sliver of outside I cradle inside  and the American poet Terrance Hayes wrote six poems called  Wind in a Box.  One of them asks   Tell me  what am I going to do when I'm dead   And the answer is that he'll stay with us or won't stay with us inside us as wind  as air  as words. It is easier than ever to find poems that might stay inside you  that might stay with you  from long  long ago  or from right this minute  from far away or from right close to where you live  almost no matter where you live. Poems can help you say  help you show how you're feeling  but they can also introduce you to feelings  ways of being in the world  people  very much unlike you  maybe even people from long  long ago. Some poems even tell you that that is what they can do. That's what John Keats is doing in his most mysterious  perhaps  poem. It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished  he probably left it unfinished  and because it might be meant for a character in a play  but it might just be Keats' thinking about what his own writing  his handwriting  could do  and in it I hear  at least I hear  mortality  and I hear the power of older poetic techniques  and I have the feeling  you might have the feeling  of meeting even for an instant  almost becoming  someone else from long ago  someone quite memorable.  This living hand  now warm and capable Of earnest grasping  would  if it were cold And in the icy silence of the tomb  So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood So in my veins red life might stream again  And thou be conscience calm d    see here it is    I hold it towards you.  Thanks. Even nature's most disgusting creatures have important secrets  but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them  Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably  cockroaches can self stabilize running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them  or give them a perturbation like an earthquake  we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass  no problem  and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where  because of their shape  they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered. The animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than     milliseconds   you never see them   using the same structures that they use to run  their legs. They can run upside down very rapidly on rods  branches and wires  and if you perturb one of those branches  they can do this. They can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet. And they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas. They have wings for flying when they get warm  but they use those same wings to flip over if they get destabilized. Very effective. Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail safe. This is the foot of a cockroach. It has spines  gluey pads and claws  but if you take off those feet  they can still go over rough terrain  like the bottom video that you see  without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary. They can run up mesh without their feet. Here's an animal using a normal  alternating tripod  three legs  three legs  three legs  but in nature  the insects often have lost their legs. Here's one moving with two middle legs gone. It can even lose three legs  in a tripod  and adopt a new gait  a hopping gait. And I point out that all of these videos are slowed down    times  so they're actually really fast  when you see this. Robust systems are also damage resistant. Here's an animal climbing up a wall. It looks like a rapid  smooth  vertical climb  but when you slow it down  you see something very different. Here's what they do. They intentionally have a head on collision with the wall so they don't slow down and can transition up it in    milliseconds. And they can do this in part because they have extraordinary exoskeletons. And they're really just made up of compliant joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another. Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach. You see these plates  and you see the compliant membrane. My engineering colleague at Berkeley designed with his students a novel manufacturing technique where you essentially origami the exoskeleton  you laser cut it  laminate it  and you fold it up into a robot. And you can do that now in less than    minutes. These robots  called DASH  for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod  are highly compliant robots  and they're remarkably robust as a result of these features. They're certainly incredibly damage resistant. They even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches. So they can use their smart  compliant body to transition up a wall in a very simple way. They even have some of the beginnings of the rapid inversion behavior where they disappear. Now we want to know why they can go anywhere. We discovered that they can go through three millimeter gaps  the height of two pennies  two stacked pennies  and when they do this  they can actually run through those confined spaces at high speeds  although you never see it. To understand it better  we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton and showed that they can compress their body by over    percent. We put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces     times their body weight  and after this they can fly and run absolutely normally. So you never know where curiosity based research will lead  and someday you may want a swarm of cockroach inspired robots to come at you. Thank you. Election night      was a night that tore me in half. It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.  One hundred and forty three   years after the end of slavery  and      years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act  an African American was elected president. Many of us never thought that this was possible until the moment that it happened. And in many ways  it was the climax of the black civil rights movement in the United States. I was in California that night  which was ground zero at the time for another movement  the marriage equality movement. Gay marriage was on the ballot in the form of Proposition    and as the election returns started to come in  it became clear that the right for same sex couples to marry  which had recently been granted by the California courts  was going to be taken away. So on the same night that Barack Obama won his historic presidency  the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats. And then it got even worse. Pretty much immediately  African Americans started to be blamed for the passage of Proposition  . This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said that blacks had voted for the measure by something like    percent. This turned out not to be true  but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in  and was grabbed on by the media. I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage. I listened to some gay commentator say that the African American community was notoriously homophobic  and now that civil rights had been achieved for us  we wanted to take away other people's rights. There were even reports of racist epithets being thrown at some of the participants of the gay rights rallies that took place after the election. And on the other side  some African Americans dismissed or ignored homophobia that was indeed real in our community. And others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights  and once again  the sinking feeling that two minority groups of which I'm both a part of were competing with each other instead of supporting each other overwhelmed and  frankly  pissed me off. Now  I'm a documentary filmmaker  so after going through my pissed off stage and yelling at the television and radio  my next instinct was to make a movie. And what guided me in making this film was  how was this happening  How was it that the gay rights movement was being pitted against the civil rights movement  And this wasn't just an abstract question. I'm a beneficiary of both movements  so this was actually personal. But then something else happened after that election in     . The march towards gay equality accelerated at a pace that surprised and shocked everyone  and is still reshaping our laws and our policies  our institutions and our entire country. And so it started to become increasingly clear to me that this pitting of the two movements against each other actually didn't make sense  and that they were in fact much  much more interconnected  and that  in fact  some of the way that the gay rights movement has been able to make such incredible gains so quickly is that it's used some of the same tactics and strategies that were first laid down by the civil rights movement. Let's just look at a few of these strategies. First off  it's really interesting to see  to actually visually see  how quick the gay rights movement has made its gains  if you look at a few of the major events on a timeline of both freedom movements. Now  there are tons of milestones in the civil rights movement  but the first one we're going to start with is the      Montgomery bus boycott. This was a protest campaign against Montgomery  Alabama's segregation on their public transit system  and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person. The campaign lasted a year  and it galvanized the civil rights movement like nothing had before it. And I call this strategy the  I'm tired of your foot on my neck  strategy. So gays and lesbians have been in society since societies began  but up until the mid   th century  homosexual acts were still illegal in most states. So just    years after the Montgomery bus boycott  a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy. It's known as Stonewall  in       and it's where a group of LGBT patrons fought back against police beatings at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked three days of rioting. Incidentally  black and latino LGBT folks were at the forefront of this rebellion  and it's a really interesting example of the intersection of our struggles against racism  homophobia  gender identity and police brutality. After Stonewall happened  gay liberation groups sprang up all over the country  and the modern gay rights  movement as we know it took off. So the next moment to look at on the timeline is the      March on Washington. This was a seminal event in the civil rights movement and it's where African Americans called for both civil and economic justice. And it's of course where Martin Luther King delivered his famous  I have a dream  speech  but what's actually less known is that this march was organized by a man named Bayard Rustin. Bayard was an out gay man  and he's considered one of the most brilliant strategists of the civil rights movement. He later in his life became a fierce advocate of LGBT rights as well  and his life is testament to the intersection of the struggles. The March on Washington is one of the high points of the movement  and it's where there was a fervent belief that African Americans too could be a part of American democracy. I call this strategy the  We are visible and many in numbers  strategy. Some early gay activists were actually directly inspired by the march  and some had taken part. Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said   We marched with Martin Luther King  seven of us from the Mattachine Society     which was an early gay rights organization    and from that moment on  we had our own dream about a gay rights march of similar proportions.  Several years later  a series of marches took place  each one gaining the momentum of the gay freedom struggle. The first one was in       and the second one took place in     . The third one was held in     . Almost a million people showed up  and people were so energized and excited by what had taken place  they went back to their own communities and started their own political and social organizations  further increasing the visibility of the movement. The day of that march  October     was then declared National Coming Out Day  and is still celebrated all over the world. These marches set the groundwork for the historic changes that we see happening today in the United States. And lastly  the  Loving  strategy. The name speaks for itself. In       the Supreme Court ruled in Loving v. Virginia  and invalidated all laws that prohibited interracial marriage. This is considered one of the Supreme Court's landmark civil rights cases. In       President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act  known as DOMA  and that made the federal government only have to recognize marriages between a man and a woman. In United States v. Windsor  a    year old lesbian named Edith Windsor sued the federal government when she was forced to pay estate taxes on her deceased wife's property  something that heterosexual  couples don't have to do. And as the case wound its way through the lower courts  the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent. When it got to the Supreme Court in       the Supreme Court agreed  and DOMA was thrown out. It was incredible. But the gay marriage movement has been making gains for years now. To date     states have passed laws allowing marriage equality. It's become the de facto battle for gay equality  and it seems like daily  laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts  even in places like Texas and Utah  which no one saw coming. So a lot has changed since that night in      when I felt torn in half. I did go on to make that film. It's a documentary film  and it's called  The New Black   and it looks at how the African American community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the gay marriage movement and this fight over the meaning of civil rights. And I wanted to capture some of this incredible change that was happening  and as luck or politics would have it  another marriage battle started gearing up  this time in Maryland  where African Americans make up    percent of the electorate. So this tension between gay rights and civil rights started to bubble up once again  and I was lucky enough to capture how some people were making the connection between the movements this time. This is a clip of Karess Taylor Hughes and Samantha Masters  two characters in the film  as they hit the streets of Baltimore and try to convince potential voters. Okay  are you registered to vote  Man  No. Karess Taylor Hughes  Okay. How old are you  Man    . KTH      You gotta get registered to vote. We got to get you registered to vote. Man  I ain't voting on no gay shit. SM  Okay  why  What's up  Man  I ain't with that. SM  That's not cool. Man  What made you be gay  SM  So what made you be straight  So what made you be straight  Man    You can't answer that question.  Laughter  KSM  I used to not have the same rights as you  but I know that because a black man like yourself stood up for a woman like me  I know that I've got the same opportunities. So you  as a black man  have the opportunity to stand up for somebody else. Whether you're gay or not  these are your brothers and sisters out here  and they need you to represent. Man    Who is you to tell somebody who they can't have sex with  who they can't be with  They ain't got that power. Nobody has that power to say  you can't marry that young lady. Who has that power  Nobody. SM  But you know what  Our state has put the power in your hands  and so what we need you to do is vote for  you gonna vote for  . Man    I got you. SM  Vote for    okay  Man    I got you. KSM  All right  do y'all need community service hours  You do  All right  you can always volunteer with us to get community service hours. Y'all want to do that  We feed you. We bring you pizza. Yoruba Richen  Thank you. What's amazing to me about that clip that we just captured as we were filming is  it really shows how Karess understands the history of the civil rights movement  but she's not restricted by it. She doesn't just limit it to black people. She sees it as a blueprint for expanding rights to gays and lesbians. Maybe because she's younger  she's like     she's able to do this a little bit more easily  but the fact is that Maryland voters did pass that marriage equality amendment  and in fact it was the first time that marriage equality was directly voted on and passed by the voters. African Americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded. It was a complete turnaround from that night in      when Proposition   was passed. It was  and feels  monumental. We in the LGBT community have gone from being a pathologized and reviled and criminalized group to being seen as part of the great human quest for dignity and equality. We've gone from having to hide our sexuality in order to maintain our jobs and our families to literally getting a place at the table with the president and a shout out at his second inauguration. I just want to read what he said at that inauguration   We the people declare today that the most evident of truths  that all of us are created equal. It is the star that guides us still  just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.  Now we know that everything is not perfect  especially when you look at what's happening with the LGBT rights issue internationally  but it says something about how far we've come when our president puts the gay freedom struggle in the context of the other great freedom struggles of our time  the women's rights movement and the civil rights movement. His statement demonstrates not only the interconnectedness of those movements  but how each one borrowed and was inspired by the other. So just as Martin Luther King learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics of civil disobedience and nonviolence  which became a bedrock of the civil rights movement  the gay rights movement saw what worked in the civil rights movement  and they used some of those same strategies and tactics to make gains at an even quicker pace. Maybe one more other reason for the relative quick progress of the gay rights movement. Whereas a lot of us continue to still live in racially segregated spaces  LGBT folks  we are everywhere. We are in urban communities and rural communities  communities of color  immigrant communities  churches and mosques and synagogues. We are your mothers and brothers and sisters and sons. And when someone that you love or a family member comes out  it may be easier to support their quest for equality. And in fact  the gay rights movement asks us to support justice and equality from a space of love. That may be the biggest  greatest gift that the movement has given us. It calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate  a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor. I just want to end with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who's no longer with us  Nelson Mandela of South Africa. Nelson Mandela led South Africa after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid  and out of the ashes of that  legalized racial discrimination  he led South Africa to become the first country in the world to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation within its constitution. Mandela said   For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains  but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.  So as these movements continue on  and as freedom struggles around the world continue on  let's remember that not only are they interconnected  but they must support and enhance each other for us to be truly victorious. Thank you. I grew up in a very small country town in Victoria. I had a very normal  low key kind of upbringing. I went to school  I hung out with my friends  I fought with my younger sisters. It was all very normal. And when I was     a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award. And my parents said   Hm  that's really nice  but there's kind of one glaring problem with that. She hasn't actually achieved anything.   Laughter  And they were right  you know. I went to school  I got good marks  I had a very low key after school job in my mum's hairdressing salon  and I spent a lot of time watching  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  and  Dawson's Creek.  Yeah  I know. What a contradiction. But they were right  you know. I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all. I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation. Years later  I was on my second teaching round in a Melbourne high school  and I was about    minutes into a year    legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said   Hey miss  when are you going to start doing your speech   And I said   What speech   You know  I'd been talking them about defamation law for a good    minutes. And he said   You know  like  your motivational speaking. You know  when people in wheelchairs come to school  they usually say  like  inspirational stuff    It's usually in the big hall.  And that's when it dawned on me  This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration. We are not  to this kid    and it's not his fault  I mean  that's true for many of us. For lots of us  disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists. We're not real people. We are there to inspire. And in fact  I am sitting on this stage looking like I do in this wheelchair  and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you. Right   Laughter  Yeah. Well  ladies and gentlemen  I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you dramatically. I am not here to inspire you. I am here to tell you that we have been lied to about disability. Yeah  we've been sold the lie that disability is a Bad Thing  capital B  capital T. It's a bad thing  and to live with a disability makes you exceptional. It's not a bad thing  and it doesn't make you exceptional. And in the past few years  we've been able to propagate this lie even further via social media. You may have seen images like this one   The only disability in life is a bad attitude.  Or this one   Your excuse is invalid.  Indeed. Or this one   Before you quit  try   These are just a couple of examples  but there are a lot of these images out there. You know  you might have seen the one  the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth. You might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs. And these images  there are lots of them out there  they are what we call inspiration porn. And I use the term porn deliberately  because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people. So in this case  we're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people. The purpose of these images is to inspire you  to motivate you  so that we can look at them and think   Well  however bad my life is  it could be worse. I could be that person.  But what if you are that person  I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational  and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile. They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  Laughter  And it is objectifying. These images  those images objectify disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people. They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren't so bad for you  to put your worries into perspective. And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult. We do overcome some things. But the things that we're overcoming are not the things that you think they are. They are not things to do with our bodies. I use the term  disabled people  quite deliberately  because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability  which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses. So I have lived in this body a long time. I'm quite fond of it. It does the things that I need it to do  and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have  and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well. They're not doing anything out of the ordinary. They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity. So is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do  to share those images  People  when they say   You're an inspiration   they mean it as a compliment. And I know why it happens. It's because of the lie  it's because we've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional. And it honestly doesn't. And I know what you're thinking. You know  I'm up here bagging out inspiration  and you're thinking   Jeez  Stella  aren't you inspired sometimes by some things   And the thing is  I am. I learn from other disabled people all the time. I'm learning not that I am luckier than them  though. I am learning that it's a genius idea to use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up things that you dropped.  Laughter  I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery. Genius. We are learning from each others' strength and endurance  not against our bodies and our diagnoses  but against a world that exceptionalizes and objectifies us. I really think that this lie that we've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice. It makes life hard for us. And that quote   The only disability in life is a bad attitude   the reason that that's bullshit is because it's just not true  because of the social model of disability. No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp. Never.

No amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop and radiating a positive attitude is going to turn all those books into braille. It's just not going to happen. I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception  but the norm. I want to live in a world where a    year old girl sitting in her bedroom watching  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  isn't referred to as achieving anything because she's doing it sitting down. I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning. I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people  and I want to live in a world where a kid in year    in a Melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user. Disability doesn't make you exceptional  but questioning what you think you know about it does. Thank you. Four years ago  a security researcher  or  as most people would call it  a hacker  found a way to literally make ATMs throw money at him. His name was Barnaby Jack  and this technique was later called  jackpotting  in his honor. I'm here today because I think we actually need hackers. Barnaby Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge  but he chose to show the world his research instead. He believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution. And I feel the same way. That's why I'm here today. We are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have. They scare us. But the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all. So I am here today because I think we need hackers  and in fact  they just might be the immune system for the information age. Sometimes they make us sick  but they also find those hidden threats in our world  and they make us fix it. I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk  so let me save you the effort. In true TED fashion  here is my most embarrassing picture. But it would be difficult for you to find me in it  because I'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side. I was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team wouldn't let me join. This is who I was  but this is who I wanted to be  Angelina Jolie. She portrayed Acid Burn in the '   film  Hackers.  She was pretty and she could rollerblade  but being a hacker  that made her powerful. And I wanted to be just like her  so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums. I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code. I didn't really know what it did  but I copy pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password protected site like that. Open Sesame. It was a simple trick  and I was just a script kiddie back then  but to me  that trick  it felt like this  like I had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips. This is the rush of power that hackers feel. It's geeks just like me discovering they have access to superpower  one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect  but thankfully no radioactive spiders. But with great power comes great responsibility  and you all like to think that if we had such powers  we would only use them for good. But what if you could read your ex's emails  or add a couple zeros to your bank account. What would you do then  Indeed  many hackers do not resist those temptations  and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud  malware or plain old identity theft  which is a serious issue. But there are other hackers  hackers who just like to break things  and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it. This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office. He learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the Internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers  no password needed. He reported it to the company  of course  but they ignored his report. Perhaps they thought universal access was a feature  not a bug  until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people's files. But they didn't steal anything. They left a note  Your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world. Here's what you should do to fix it. We hope we helped. By getting into people's files like that  yeah  they broke the law  but they also forced that company to fix their product. Making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure in the hacker community  and it is controversial  but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day. This is what Khalil did. Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank  and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook which he attempted to report through the company's bug bounty program. These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code. Unfortunately  due to some miscommunications  his report was not acknowledged. Frustrated with the exchange  he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall. This got their attention  all right  and they fixed the bug  but because he hadn't reported it properly  he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries. Thankfully for Khalil  a group of hackers were watching out for him. In fact  they raised more than        dollars to reward him for this discovery  raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing. But I think there's a greater story here still. Even companies founded by hackers  like Facebook was  still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers. And so for more conservative organizations  it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it. But I think it's worth the effort  because the alternative  to blindly fight all hackers  is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge. These are things that will come back and bite you. It is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web  especially in times like this  like today even  as governments and corporates fight to control the Internet. I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition  its last line of defense even  perhaps someone like Anonymous  the leading brand of global hacktivism. This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today  but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns. Their moment of transformation was in early      when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites. This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers. It turns out  the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it  and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world  from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide  Australia. This proved that Anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets  and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world. Since then  they've gone after many targets. They've uncovered corruption  abuse. They've hacked popes and politicians  and I think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents. I think that  like Robin Hood  they are in the business of redistribution  but what they are after isn't your money. It's not your documents. It's your attention. They grab the spotlight for causes they support  forcing us to take note  acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be. They have been called many names from criminals to terrorists  and I cannot justify their illegal means  but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all. The reality is  hackers can do a lot more than break things. They can bring people together. And if the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it  just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down. This took place in Egypt in January       and as President Hosni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo  he sent his personal troops down to Egypt's Internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country's connection to the world overnight. For a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented  and for hackers  it made it personal. Hackers like the Telecomix group were already active on the ground  helping Egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like Morse code and ham radio. It was high season for low tech  which the government couldn't block  but when the Net went completely down  Telecomix brought in the big guns. They found European service providers that still had    year old analog dial up access infrastructure. They opened up     of those lines for Egyptians to use  serving slow but sweet Internet connection for Egyptians. This worked. It worked so well  in fact  one guy even used it to download an episode of  How I Met Your Mother.  But while Egypt's future is still uncertain  when the same thing happened in Syria just one year later  Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines  and Anonymous  they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the Syrian military by defacing their website. But with this sort of power  it really depends on where you stand  because one man's hero can be another's villain  and so the Syrian Electronic Army is a pro Assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime. They've taken down multiple high profile targets in the past few years  including the Associated Press's Twitter account  in which they posted a message about an attack on the White House injuring President Obama. This tweet was fake  of course  but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index that day was most certainly not  and a lot of people lost a lot of money. This sort of thing is happening all over the world right now. In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America  from Europe to the United States  hackers are a force for social  political and military influence. As individuals or in groups  volunteers or military conflicts  there are hackers everywhere. They come from all walks of life  ethnicities  ideologies and genders  I might add. They are now shaping the world's stage. Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the   st century. This is because access to information is a critical currency of power  one which governments would like to control  a thing they attempt to do by setting up all you can eat surveillance programs  a thing they need hackers for  by the way. And so the establishment has long had a love hate relationship when it comes to hackers  because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large. Two years ago  I saw General Keith Alexander. He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander  but instead of his four star general uniform  he was wearing jeans and a t shirt. This was at DEF CON  the world's largest hacker conference. Perhaps like me  General Alexander didn't see        criminals that day in Vegas. I think he saw untapped potential. In fact  he was there to give a hiring pitch.  In this room right here   he said   is the talent our nation needs.  Well  hackers in the back row replied   Then stop arresting us.  Indeed  for years  hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence  but in light of what we know now  who is more watchful of our online world  The rules of the game are not that clear anymore  but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data hoarding corporates on their own playing field. To me  that represents hope. For the past three decades  hackers have done a lot of things  but they have also impacted civil liberties  innovation and Internet freedom  so I think it's time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them  because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys  how can they be the heroes too  My years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about hackers  They just can't see something broken in the world and leave it be. They are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it  and so they find the vulnerable aspects in our rapidly changing world. They make us  they force us to fix things or demand something better  and I think we need them to do just that  because after all  it is not information that wants to be free  it's us. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Hack the planet  It was less than a year after September     and I was at the Chicago Tribune writing about shootings and murders  and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed. I had done some activism in college  so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing. I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive  but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever  and we were all arrested. Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence. My charges were dismissed  but a few weeks later  two FBI agents knocked on my door  and they told me that unless I helped them by spying on protest groups  they would put me on a domestic terrorist list. I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch  but I was terrified  and when my fear subsided  I became obsessed with finding out how this happened  how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the FBI's number one domestic terrorism threat. A few years later  I was invited to testify before Congress about my reporting  and I told lawmakers that  while everybody is talking about going green  some people are risking their lives to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines. They're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers' harpoons and the whales. These are everyday people  like these protesters in Italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing. And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular  so in       their opponents made up a new word  eco terrorist  to shift how we view them. They just made it up. Now these companies have backed new laws like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act  which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits. Now most people never even heard about this law  including members of Congress. Less than one percent were in the room when it passed the House. The rest were outside at a new memorial. They were praising Dr. King as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment. Supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists  the vandals  the arsonists  the radicals. But right now  companies like TransCanada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists. The FBI's training documents on eco terrorism are not about violence  they're about public relations. Today  in multiple countries  corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms. The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago  and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism. The first of these ag gag prosecutions  as they're called  was a young woman named Amy Meyer  and Amy saw a sick cow being moved by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse as she was on the public street. And Amy did what any of us would  She filmed it. When I found out about her story  I wrote about it  and within    hours  it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges. But apparently  even exposing stuff like that is a threat. Through the Freedom of Information Act  I learned that the counter terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one. They even included this nice little write up of my book. They described it as  compelling and well written.  Blurb on the next book  right  The point of all of this is to make us afraid  but as a journalist  I have an unwavering faith in the power of education. Our best weapon is sunlight. Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he's a man and not a piano key. Over and over throughout history  people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent. It's time we strike a new note. Thank you. In the middle of my Ph.D.  I was hopelessly stuck. Every research direction that I tried led to a dead end. It seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working. I felt like a pilot flying through the mist  and I lost all sense of direction. I stopped shaving. I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. I felt unworthy of stepping across the gates of the university  because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton or any other scientist whose results I had learned about  because in science  we just learn about the results  not the process. And so obviously  I couldn't be a scientist. But I had enough support and I made it through and discovered something new about nature. This is an amazing feeling of calmness  being the only person in the world who knows a new law of nature. And I started the second project in my Ph.D  and it happened again. I got stuck and I made it through. And I started thinking  maybe there's a pattern here. I asked the other graduate students  and they said   Yeah  that's exactly what happened to us  except nobody told us about it.  We'd all studied science as if it's a series of logical steps between question and answer  but doing research is nothing like that. At the same time  I was also studying to be an improvisation theater actor. So physics by day  and by night  laughing  jumping  singing  playing my guitar. Improvisation theater  just like science  goes into the unknown  because you have to make a scene onstage without a director  without a script  without having any idea what you'll portray or what the other characters will do. But unlike science  in improvisation theater  they tell you from day one what's going to happen to you when you get onstage. You're going to fail miserably. You're going to get stuck. And we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place. For example  we had an exercise where we all stood in a circle  and each person had to do the world's worst tap dance  and everybody else applauded and cheered you on  supporting you onstage. When I became a professor and had to guide my own students through their research projects  I realized again  I don't know what to do. I'd studied thousands of hours of physics  biology  chemistry  but not one hour  not one concept on how to mentor  how to guide someone to go together into the unknown  about motivation. So I turned to improvisation theater  and I told my students from day one what's going to happen when you start research  and this has to do with our mental schema of what research will be like. Because you see  whenever people do anything  for example if I want to touch this blackboard  my brain first builds up a schema  a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do before I even start moving my hand  and if I get blocked  if my schema doesn't match reality  that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance. That's why your schemas had better match reality. But if you believe the way science is taught  and if you believe textbooks  you're liable to have the following schema of research. If A is the question  and B is the answer  then research is a direct path. The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work  or a student gets depressed  it's perceived as something utterly wrong and causes tremendous stress. And that's why I teach my students a more realistic schema. Here's an example where things don't match your schema. So I teach my students a different schema. If A is the question  B is the answer  stay creative in the cloud  and you start going  and experiments don't work  experiments don't work  experiments don't work  experiments don't work  until you reach a place linked with negative emotions where it seems like your basic assumptions have stopped making sense  like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet. And I call this place the cloud. Now you can be lost in the cloud for a day  a week  a month  a year  a whole career  but sometimes  if you're lucky enough and you have enough support  you can see in the materials at hand  or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud  a new answer  C  and you decide to go for it. And experiments don't work  experiments don't work  but you get there  and then you tell everyone about it by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C  which is a great way to communicate  but as long as you don't forget the path that brought you there. Now this cloud is an inherent part of research  an inherent part of our craft  because the cloud stands guard at the boundary. It stands guard at the boundary between the known and the unknown  because in order to discover something truly new  at least one of your basic assumptions has to change  and that means that in science  we do something quite heroic. Every day  we try to bring ourselves to the boundary between the known and the unknown and face the cloud. Now notice that I put B in the land of the known  because we knew about it in the beginning  but C is always more interesting and more important than B. So B is essential in order to get going  but C is much more profound  and that's the amazing thing about resesarch. Now just knowing that word  the cloud  has been transformational in my research group  because students come to me and say   Uri  I'm in the cloud   and I say   Great  you must be feeling miserable.  But I'm kind of happy  because we might be close to the boundary between the known and the unknown  and we stand a chance of discovering something truly new  since the way our mind works  it's just knowing that the cloud is normal  it's essential  and in fact beautiful  we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society  and it detoxifies the feeling that something is deeply wrong with me. And as a mentor  I know what to do  which is to step up my support for the student  because research in psychology shows that if you're feeling fear and despair  your mind narrows down to very safe and conservative ways of thinking. If you'd like to explore the risky paths needed to get out of the cloud  you need other emotions    solidarity  support  hope   that come with your connection from somebody else  so like in improvisation theater  in science  it's best to walk into the unknown together. So knowing about the cloud  you also learn from improvisation theater a very effective way to have conversations inside the cloud. It's based on the central principle of improvisation theater  so here improvisation theater came to my help again. It's called saying  Yes  and  to the offers made by other actors. That means accepting the offers and building on them  saying   Yes  and.  For example  if one actor says   Here is a pool of water   and the other actor says   No  that's just a stage   the improvisation is over. It's dead  and everybody feels frustrated. That's called blocking. If you're not mindful of communications  scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking. Saying  Yes  and  sounds like this.  Here is a pool of water.   Yeah  let's jump in.   Look  there's a whale  Let's grab it by its tail. It's pulling us to the moon   So saying  Yes  and  bypasses our inner critic. We all have an inner critic that kind of guards what we say  so people don't think that we're obscene or crazy or unoriginal  and science is full of the fear of appearing unoriginal. Saying  Yes  and  bypasses the critic and unlocks hidden voices of creativity you didn't even know that you had  and they often carry the answer about the cloud. So you see  knowing about the cloud and about saying  Yes  and  made my lab very creative. Students started playing off of each others' ideas  and we made surprising discoveries in the interface between physics and biology. For example  we were stuck for a year trying to understand the intricate biochemical networks inside our cells  and we said   We are deeply in the cloud   and we had a playful conversation where my student Shai Shen Orr said   Let's just draw this on a piece of paper  this network   and instead of saying   But we've done that so many times and it doesn't work   I said   Yes  and let's use a very big piece of paper   and then Ron Milo said   Let's use a gigantic architect's blueprint kind of paper  and I know where to print it   and we printed out the network and looked at it  and that's where we made our most important discovery  that this complicated network is just made of a handful of simple  repeating interaction patterns like motifs in a stained glass window. We call them network motifs  and they're the elementary circuits that help us understand the logic of the way cells make decisions in all organisms  including our body. Soon enough  after this  I started being invited to give talks to thousands of scientists across the world  but the knowledge about the cloud and saying  Yes  and  just stayed within my own lab  because you see  in science  we don't talk about the process  anything subjective or emotional. We talk about the results. So there was no way to talk about it in conferences. That was unthinkable. And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck without even having a word to describe what they're seeing  and their ways of thinking narrowed down to very safe paths  their science didn't reach its full potential  and they were miserable. I thought  that's the way it is. I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible  and if everybody else does the same  science will eventually become more and more better and better. That way of thinking got turned on its head when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller give a talk about her experiences as a woman in science. And she asked   Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science  It's not by chance. It's a matter of values.  You see  science seeks knowledge that's objective and rational. That's the beautiful thing about science. But we also have a cultural myth that the doing of science  what we do every day to get that knowledge  is also only objective and rational  like Mr. Spock. And when you label something as objective and rational  automatically  the other side  the subjective and emotional  become labeled as non science or anti science or threatening to science  and we just don't talk about it. And when I heard that  that science has a culture  everything clicked into place for me  because if science has a culture  culture can be changed  and I can be a change agent working to change the culture of science wherever I could. And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference  I talked about my science  and then I talked about the importance of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science and how we should talk about them  and I looked at the audience  and they were cold. They couldn't hear what I was saying in the context of a    back to back PowerPoint presentation conference. And I tried again and again  conference after conference  but I wasn't getting through. I was in the cloud. And eventually I managed to get out the cloud using improvisation and music. Since then  every conference I go to  I give a science talk and a second  special talk called  Love and fear in the lab   and I start it off by doing a song about scientists' greatest fear  which is that we work hard  we discover something new  and somebody else publishes it before we do. We call it being scooped  and being scooped feels horrible. It makes us afraid to talk to each other  which is no fun  because we came to science to share our ideas and to learn from each other  and so I do a blues song  which    Applause    called  Scooped Again   and I ask the audience to be my backup singers  and I tell them   Your text is 'Scoop  Scoop.'  It sounds like this   Scoop  scoop   Sounds like this.   I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop    And then we go for it.   I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      Oh mama  can't you feel my pain     Heavens help me  I've been scooped again   Thank you. Thank you for your backup singing. So everybody starts laughing  starts breathing  notices that there's other scientists around them with shared issues  and we start talking about the emotional and subjective things that go on in research. It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted. Finally  we can talk about this in a scientific conference. And scientists have gone on to form peer groups where they meet regularly and create a space to talk about the emotional and subjective things that happen as they're mentoring  as they're going into the unknown  and even started courses about the process of doing science  about going into the unknown together  and many other things. So my vision is that  just like every scientist knows the word  atom   that matter is made out of atoms  every scientist would know the words like  the cloud   saying  Yes  and   and science will become much more creative  make many  many more unexpected discoveries for the benefit of us all  and would also be much more playful. And what I might ask you to remember from this talk is that next time you face a problem you can't solve in work or in life  there's a word for what you're going to see  the cloud. And you can go through the cloud not alone but together with someone who is your source of support to say  Yes  and  to your ideas  to help you say  Yes  and  to your own ideas  to increase the chance that  through the wisps of the cloud  you'll find that moment of calmness where you get your first glimpse of your unexpected discovery  your C. Thank you. Six months ago  I got an email from a man in Israel who had read one of my books  and the email said   You don't know me  but I'm your   th cousin.  And it said   I have a family tree with        people on it  including you  Karl Marx  and several European aristocrats.  Now I did not know what to make of this. Part of me was like  okay  when's he going to ask me to wire        dollars to his Nigerian bank  right  I also thought         relatives  do I want that  I have enough trouble with some of the ones I have already. And I won't name names  but you know who you are. But another part of me said  this is remarkable. Here I am alone in my office  but I'm not alone at all. I'm connected to        people around the world  and that's four Madison Square Gardens full of cousins. And some of them are going to be great  and some of them are going to be irritating  but they're all related to me. So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy  which I always thought was a very staid and proper field  but it turns out it's going through a fascinating revolution  and a controversial one. Partly  this is because of DNA and genetic testing  but partly  it's because of the Internet. There are sites that now take the Wikipedia approach to family trees  collaboration and crowdsourcing  and what you do is  you load your family tree on  and then these sites search to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree  and if it is  then you can combine  and then you combine and combine and combine until you get these massive  mega family trees with thousands of people on them  or even millions. I'm on something on Geni called the world family tree  which has no less than a jaw dropping    million people. So that's    million people connected by blood or marriage  sometimes both. It's in all seven continents  including Antarctica. I'm on it. Many of you are on it  whether you know it or not  and you can see the links. Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow. She has no idea I exist  but we are officially cousins. We have just    links between us. And there's my cousin Barack Obama. And he is my aunt's fifth great aunt's husband's father's wife's seventh great nephew  so practically my old brother. And my cousin  of course  the actor Kevin Bacon    who is my first cousin's twice removed's wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's niece's husband. So six degrees of Kevin Bacon  plus or minus several degrees. Now  I'm not boasting  because all of you have famous people and historical figures in your tree  because we are all connected  and    million may seem like a lot  but in a few years  it's quite likely we will have a family tree with all  almost all  seven billion people on Earth. But does it really matter  What's the importance  And I do think it is important  and I'll give you five reasons why  really quickly. First  it's got scientific value. This is an unprecedented history of the human race  and it's giving us valuable data about how diseases are inherited  how people migrate  and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now studying the world family tree. Number two  it brings history alive. I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein  so I told my seven year old son that  and he was totally engaged. Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy with weird hair. He's Uncle Albert.  Laughter  And my son wanted to know   What did he say  What is E   MC squared   Also  it's not all good news. I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer  the serial killer  but I will say that's on my wife's side. So I want to make that clear. Sorry  honey. Number three  interconnectedness. We all come from the same ancestor  and you don't have to believe the literal Bible version  but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam and mitochondrial Eve  and these were about         to         years ago. We all have a bit of their DNA in us. They are our great great great great great great    continue that for about       times    grandparents  and so that means we literally all are biological cousins as well  and estimates vary  but probably the farthest cousin you have on Earth is about a   th cousin. Now  it's not just ancestors we share  descendants. If you have kids  and they have kids  look how quickly the descendants accumulate. So in        generations  you're going to have thousands of offspring  and millions of offspring. Number four  a kinder world. Now  I know that there are family feuds. I have three sons  so I see how they fight. But I think that there's also a human bias to treat your family a little better than strangers. I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots  because they're going to have to realize that they are cousins with thousands of people in whatever ethnic group they happen to have issues with  and I think you look back at history  and a lot of the terrible things we've done to each other is because one group thinks another group is sub human  and you can't do that anymore. We're not just part of the same species. We're part of the same family. We share   .  percent of our DNA. Now the final one is number five  a democratizing effect. Some genealogy has an elitist strain  like people say   Oh  I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots and you're not  so you cannot join my country club.  But that's really going to be hard to do now  because everyone is related. I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots    by marriage  but still. So it's really a fascinating time in the history of family  because it's changing so fast. There is gay marriage and sperm donors and there's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale  and this makes some of my more conservative cousins a little nervous  but I actually think it's a good thing. I think the more inclusive the idea of family is  the better  because then you have more potential caretakers  and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed Hillary Clinton says    it takes a village. So I have all these hundreds and thousands  millions of new cousins. I thought  what can I do with this information  And that's when I decided  why not throw a party  So that's what I'm doing. And you're all invited. Next year  next summer  I will be hosting what I hope is the biggest and best family reunion in history. Thank you. I want you there. I want you there. It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science  which is a great venue  but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair  which is  I think  very appropriate  because I see this as a family reunion meets a world's fair. There's going to be exhibits and food  music. Paul McCartney is    steps away  so I'm hoping he brings his guitar. He hasn't RSVP'd yet  but fingers crossed. And there is going to be a day of speakers  of fascinating cousins. It's early  but I've already  I've got some lined up. Cass Sunstein  my cousin who is perhaps the most brilliant legal scholar  will be talking. He was a former member of the Obama administration. And on the other side of the political spectrum  George H.W. Bush  number     the father  he has agreed to participate  and Nick Kroll  the comedian  and Dr. Oz  and many more to come. And  of course  the most important is that you  I want you guys there  and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org and figure out how you're on the family tree  because these are big issues  family and tribe  and I don't know all the answers  but I have a lot of smart relatives  including you guys  so together  I think we can figure it out. Only together can we solve these big problems. So from cousin to cousin  I thank you. I can't wait to see you. Goodbye. People say things about religion all the time. The late  great Christopher Hitchens wrote a book called  God Is Not Great  whose subtitle was   Religion Poisons Everything.  But last month  in Time magazine  Rabbi David Wolpe  who I gather is referred to as America's rabbi  said  to balance that against that negative characterization  that no important form of social change can be brought about except through organized religion. Now  remarks of this sort on the negative and the positive side are very old. I have one in my pocket here from the first century BCE by Lucretius  the author of  On the Nature of Things   who said   Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum     I should have been able to learn that by heart   which is  that's how much religion is able to persuade people to do evil  and he was talking about the fact of Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice in order to preserve the prospects of his army. So there have been these long debates over the centuries  in that case  actually  we can say over the millennia  about religion. People have talked about it a lot  and they've said good and bad and indifferent things about it. What I want to persuade you of today is of a very simple claim  which is that these debates are in a certain sense preposterous  because there is no such thing as religion about which to make these claims. There isn't a thing called religion  and so it can't be good or bad. It can't even be indifferent. And if you think about claims about the nonexistence of things  one obvious way to try and establish the nonexistence of a purported thing would be to offer a definition of that thing and then to see whether anything satisfied it. I'm going to start out on that little route to begin with. So if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it  one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings. As I say  this is in many dictionaries  but you'll also find it actually in the work of Sir Edward Tylor  who was the first professor of anthropology at Oxford  one of the first modern anthropologists. In his book on primitive culture  he says the heart of religion is what he called animism  that is  the belief in spiritual agency  belief in spirits. The first problem for that definition is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called  Tuff.  There's a guy talking to a rabbi. The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God. The guy says   You're a rabbi  how can you not believe in God   And the reply is   It's what's so great about being Jewish. You don't have to believe in a God per se  just in being Jewish.   Laughter  So if this guy is a rabbi  and a Jewish rabbi  and if you have to believe in God in order to be religious  then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi without believing in God  Judaism isn't a religion. That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought. Here's another argument against this view. A friend of mine  an Indian friend of mine  went to his grandfather when he was very young  a child  and said to him   I want to talk to you about religion   and his grandfather said   You're too young. Come back when you're a teenager.  So he came back when he was a teenager  and he said to his grandfather   It may be a bit late now because I've discovered that I don't believe in the gods.  And his grandfather  who was a wise man  said   Oh  so you belong to the atheist branch of the Hindu tradition.   Laughter  And finally  there's this guy  who famously doesn't believe in God. His name is the Dalai Lama. He often jokes that he's one of the world's leading atheists. But it's true  because the Dalai Lama's religion does not involve belief in God. Now you might think this just shows that I've given you the wrong definition and that I should come up with some other definition and test it against these cases and try and find something that captures atheistic Judaism  atheistic Hinduism  and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity  but I actually think that that's a bad idea  and the reason I think it's a bad idea is that I don't think that's how our concept of religion works. I think the way our concept of religion works is that we actually have  we have a list of paradigm religions and their sub parts  right  and if something new comes along that purports to be a religion  what we ask is   Well  is it like one of these   Right  And I think that's not only how we think about religion  and that's  as it were  so from our point of view  anything on that list had better be a religion  which is why I don't think an account of religion that excludes Buddhism and Judaism has a chance of being a good starter  because they're on our list. But why do we have such a list  What's going on  How did it come about that we have this list  I think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore crude and contentious. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it  but here's my story  and true or not  it's a story that I think gives you a good sense of how the list might have come about  and therefore helps you to think about what use the list might be. I think the answer is  European travelers  starting roughly about the time of Columbus  started going around the world. They came from a Christian culture  and when they arrived in a new place  they noticed that some people didn't have Christianity  and so they asked themselves the following question  what have they got instead of Christianity  And that list was essentially constructed. It consists of the things that other people had instead of Christianity. Now there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way  which is that Christianity is extremely  even on that list  it's an extremely specific tradition. It has all kinds of things in it that are very  very particular that are the results of the specifics of Christian history  and one thing that's at the heart of it  one thing that's at the heart of most understandings of Christianity  which is the result of the specific history of Christianity  is that it's an extremely creedal religion. It's a religion in which people are really concerned about whether you believe the right things. The history of Christianity  the internal history of Christianity  is largely the history of people killing each other because they believed the wrong thing  and it's also involved in struggles with other religions  obviously starting in the Middle Ages  a struggle with Islam  in which  again  it was the infidelity  the fact that they didn't believe the right things  that seemed so offensive to the Christian world. Now that's a very specific and particular history that Christianity has  and not everywhere is everything that has ever been put on this sort of list like it. Here's another problem  I think. A very specific thing happened. It was actually adverted to earlier  but a very specific thing happened in the history of the kind of Christianity that we see around us mostly in the United States today  and it happened in the late   th century  and that specific thing that happened in the late   th century was a kind of deal that was cut between science  this new way of organizing intellectual authority  and religion. If you think about the   th century  say  if you think about intellectual life before the late   th century  anything you did  anything you thought about  whether it was the physical world  the human world  the natural world apart from the human world  or morality  anything you did would have been framed against the background of a set of assumptions that were religious  Christian assumptions. You couldn't give an account of the natural world that didn't say something about its relationship  for example  to the creation story in the Abrahamic tradition  the creation story in the first book of the Torah. So everything was framed in that way. But this changes in the late   th century  and for the first time  it's possible for people to develop serious intellectual careers as natural historians like Darwin. Darwin worried about the relationship between what he said and the truths of religion  but he could proceed  he could write books about his subject without having to say what the relationship was to the religious claims  and similarly  geologists increasingly could talk about it. In the early   th century  if you were a geologist and made a claim about the age of the Earth  you had to explain whether that was consistent or how it was or wasn't consistent with the age of the Earth implied by the account in Genesis. By the end of the   th century  you can just write a geology textbook in which you make arguments about how old the Earth is. So there's a big change  and that division  that intellectual division of labor occurs as I say  I think  and it sort of solidifies so that by the end of the   th century in Europe  there's a real intellectual division of labor  and you can do all sorts of serious things  including  increasingly  even philosophy  without being constrained by the thought   Well  what I have to say has to be consistent with the deep truths that are given to me by our religious tradition.  So imagine someone who's coming out of that world  that late   th century world  coming into the country that I grew up in  Ghana  the society that I grew up in  Asante  coming into that world at the turn of the   th century with this question that made the list  what have they got instead of Christianity  Well  here's one thing he would have noticed  and by the way  there was a  person who actually did this. His name was Captain Rattray  he was sent as the British government anthropologist  and he wrote a book about Asante religion. This is a soul disc. There are many of them in the British Museum. I could give you an interesting  different history of how it comes about that many of the things from my society ended up in the British Museum  but we don't have time for that. So this object is a soul disc. What is a soul disc  It was worn around the necks of the soul washers of the Asante king. What was their job  To wash the king's soul. It would take a long while to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing that could be washed  but Rattray knew that this was religion because souls were in play. And similarly  there were many other things  many other practices. For example  every time anybody had a drink  more or less  they poured a little bit on the ground in what's called the libation  and they gave some to the ancestors. My father did this. Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey  which I'm glad to say was very often  he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground  and he would talk to  he would say to Akroma Ampim  the founder of our line  or Yao Antony  my great uncle  he would talk to them  offer them a little bit of this. And finally  there were these huge public ceremonials. This is an early   th century drawing by another British military officer of such a ceremonial  where the king was involved  and the king's job  one of the large parts of his job  apart from organizing warfare and things like that  was to look after the tombs of his ancestors  and when a king died  the stool that he sat on was blackened and put in the royal ancestral temple  and every    days  the King of Asante has to go and do cult for his ancestors. That's a large part of his job  and people think that if he doesn't do it  things will fall apart. So he's a religious figure  as Rattray would have said  as well as a political figure. So all this would count as religion for Rattray  but my point is that when you look into the lives of those people  you also find that every time they do anything  they're conscious of the ancestors. Every morning at breakfast  you can go outside the front of the house and make an offering to the god tree  the nyame dua outside your house  and again  you'll talk to the gods and the high gods and the low gods and the ancestors and so on. This is not a world in which the separation between religion and science has occurred. Religion has not being separated from any other areas of life  and in particular  what's crucial to understand about this world is that it's a world in which the job that science does for us is done by what Rattray is going to call religion  because if they want an explanation of something  if they want to know why the crop just failed  if they want to know why it's raining or not raining  if they need rain  if they want to know why their grandfather has died  they are going to appeal to the very same entities  the very same language  talk to the very same gods about that. This great separation  in other words  between religion and science hasn't happened. Now  this would be a mere historical curiosity  except that in large parts of the world  this is still the truth. I had the privilege of going to a wedding the other day in northern Namibia     miles or so south of the Angolan border in a village of     people. These were modern people. We had with us Oona Chaplin  who some of you may have heard of  and one of the people from this village came up to her  and said   I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'  So these were not people who were isolated from our world  but nevertheless  for them  the gods and the spirits are still very much there  and when we were on the bus going back and forth to the various parts of the  ceremony   they prayed not just in a generic way but for the safety of the journey  and they meant it  and when they said to me that my mother  the bridegroom's  grandmother   was with us  they didn't mean it figuratively. They meant  even though she was a dead person  they meant that she was still around. So in large parts of the world today  that separation between science and religion hasn't occurred in large parts of the world today  and as I say  these are not    This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank. These are fellow citizens of the world with you  but they come from a place in which religion is occupying a very different role. So what I want you to think about next time somebody wants to make some vast generalization about religion is that maybe there isn't such a thing as a religion  such a thing as religion  and that therefore what they say cannot possibly be true. I need to start by telling you a little bit about my social life  which I know may not seem relevant  but it is. When people meet me at parties and they find out that I'm an English professor who specializes in language  they generally have one of two reactions. One set of people look frightened.  Laughter  They often say something like   Oh  I'd better be careful what I say. I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make.  And then they stop talking.  Laughter  And they wait for me to go away and talk to someone else. The other set of people  their eyes light up  and they say   You are just the person I want to talk to.  And then they tell me about whatever it is they think is going wrong with the English language. A couple of weeks ago  I was at a dinner party and the man to my right started telling me about all the ways that the Internet is degrading the English language. He brought up Facebook  and he said   To defriend  I mean  is that even a real word   I want to pause on that question  What makes a word real  My dinner companion and I both know what the verb  defriend  means  so when does a new word like  defriend  become real  Who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words  anyway  Those are the questions I want to talk about today. I think most people  when they say a word isn't real  what they mean is  it doesn't appear in a standard dictionary. That  of course  raises a host of other questions  including  who writes dictionaries  Before I go any further  let me clarify my role in all of this. I do not write dictionaries. I do  however  collect new words much the way dictionary editors do  and the great thing about being a historian of the English language is that I get to call this  research.  When I teach the history of the English language  I require that students teach me two new slang words before I will begin class. Over the years  I have learned some great new slang this way  including  hangry   which    which is when you are cranky or angry because you are hungry  and  adorkable   which is when you are adorable in kind of a dorky way  clearly  terrific words that fill important gaps in the English language. But how real are they if we use them primarily as slang and they don't yet appear in a dictionary  With that  let's turn to dictionaries. I'm going to do this as a show of hands  How many of you still regularly refer to a dictionary  either print or online  Okay  so that looks like most of you. Now  a second question. Again  a show of hands  How many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary you are using  Okay  many fewer. At some level  we know that there are human hands behind dictionaries  but we're really not sure who those hands belong to. I'm actually fascinated by this. Even the most critical people out there tend not to be very critical about dictionaries  not distinguishing among them and not asking a whole lot of questions about who edited them. Just think about the phrase  Look it up in the dictionary   which suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same. Consider the library here on campus  where you go into the reading room  and there is a large  unabridged dictionary up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect lying open so we can go stand before it to get answers. Now  don't get me wrong  dictionaries are fantastic resources  but they are human and they are not timeless. I'm struck as a teacher that we tell students to critically question every text they read  every website they visit  except dictionaries  which we tend to treat as un authored  as if they came from nowhere to give us answers about what words really mean. Here's the thing  If you ask dictionary editors  what they'll tell you is they're just trying to keep up with us as we change the language. They're watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what's going to stick and what's not going to stick. They have to gamble  because they want to appear cutting edge and catch the words that are going to make it  such as LOL  but they don't want to appear faddish and include the words that aren't going to make it  and I think a word that they're watching right now is YOLO  you only live once. Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors  and you might be surprised by one of the places where we hang out. Every January  we go to the American Dialect Society annual meeting  where among other things  we vote on the word of the year. There are about     or     people who come  some of the best known linguists in the United States. To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting  it occurs right before happy hour. Anyone who comes can vote. The most important rule is that you can vote with only one hand. In the past  some of the winners have been  tweet  in      and  hashtag  in     .  Chad  was the word of the year in the year       because who knew what a chad was before       and  WMD  in     . Now  we have other categories in which we vote too  and my favorite category is most creative word of the year. Past winners in this category have included  recombobulation area   which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security  where you can recombobulate. You can put your belt back on  put your computer back in your bag. And then my all time favorite word at this vote  which is  multi slacking.  And multi slacking is the act of having multiple windows up on your screen so it looks like you're working when you're actually goofing around on the web. Will all of these words stick  Absolutely not. And we have made some questionable choices  for example in      when the word of the year was  Plutoed   to mean demoted. But some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable  such as  app  and  e  as a prefix  and  google  as a verb. Now  a few weeks before our vote  Lake Superior State University issues its list of banished words for the year. What is striking about this is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap between their list and the list that we are considering for words of the year  and this is because we're noticing the same thing. We're noticing words that are coming into prominence. It's really a question of attitude. Are you bothered by language fads and language change  or do you find it fun  interesting  something worthy of study as part of a living language  The list by Lake Superior State University continues a fairly long tradition in English of complaints about new words. So here is Dean Henry Alford in       who was very concerned that  desirability  is really a terrible word. In       Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter to David Hume giving up the word  colonize  as bad. Over the years  we've also seen worries about new pronunciations. Here is Samuel Rogers in      who is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations that he finds offensive  and he says  as if contemplate were not bad enough  balcony makes me sick.  The word is borrowed in from Italian and it was pronounced bal COE nee. These complaints now strike us as quaint  if not downright adorkable     Laughter     but here's the thing  we still get quite worked up about language change. I have an entire file in my office of newspaper articles which express concern about illegitimate words that should not have been included in the dictionary  including  LOL  when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary and  defriend  when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary. I also have articles expressing concern about  invite  as a noun   impact  as a verb  because only teeth can be impacted  and  incentivize  is described as  boorish  bureaucratic misspeak.  Now  it's not that dictionary editors ignore these kinds of attitudes about language. They try to provide us some guidance about words that are considered slang or informal or offensive  often through usage labels  but they're in something of a bind  because they're trying to describe what we do  and they know that we often go to dictionaries to get information about how we should use a word well or appropriately. In response  the American Heritage Dictionaries include usage notes. Usage notes tend to occur with words that are troublesome in one way  and one of the ways that they can be troublesome is that they're changing meaning. Now usage notes involve very human decisions  and I think  as dictionary users  we're often not as aware of those human decisions as we should be. To show you what I mean  we'll look at an example  but before we do  I want to explain what the dictionary editors are trying to deal with in this usage note. Think about the word  peruse  and how you use that word. I would guess many of you are thinking of skim  scan  reading quickly. Some of you may even have some walking involved  because you're perusing grocery store shelves  or something like that. You might be surprised to learn that if you look in most standard dictionaries  the first definition will be to read carefully  or pore over. American Heritage has that as the first definition. They then have  as the second definition  skim  and next to that  they say  usage problem.  And then they include a usage note  which is worth looking at. So here's the usage note   Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'... But the word is often used more loosely  to mean simply 'to read.'... Further extension of the word to mean 'to glance over  skim ' has traditionally been considered an error  but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming somewhat more acceptable. When asked about the sentence  'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly '    percent of the  Usage  Panel found it unacceptable in          percent in       and    percent in     .  Ah  the Usage Panel  that trusted body of language authorities who is getting more lenient about this. Now  what I hope you're thinking right now is   Wait  who's on the Usage Panel  And what should I do with their pronouncements   If you look in the front matter of American Heritage Dictionaries  you can actually find the names of the people on the Usage Panel. But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries  There are about     people on the Usage Panel. They include academicians  journalists  creative writers. There's a Supreme Court justice on it and a few linguists. As of       the list includes me. Here's what we can do for you. We can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage. That is and should be the extent of our authority. We are not a language academy. About once a year  I get a ballot that asks me about whether new uses  new pronunciations  new meanings  are acceptable. Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot. I listen to what other people are saying and writing. I do not listen to my own likes and dislikes about the English language. I will be honest with you  I do not like the word  impactful   but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether  impactful  is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose. So to be responsible  what I do is go look at usage  which often involves going to look at online databases such as Google Books. Well  if you look for  impactful  in Google Books  here is what you find. Well  it sure looks like  impactful  is proving useful for a certain number of writers  and has become more and more useful over the last    years. Now  there are going to be changes that all of us don't like in the language. There are going to be changes where you think   Really  Does the language have to change that way   What I'm saying is  we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible  we should be less quick to impose our likes and dislikes about words on other people  and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the English language is in trouble. It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it. In retrospect  we think it's fascinating that the word  nice  used to mean silly  and that the word  decimate  used to mean to kill one in every   . We think that Ben Franklin was being silly to worry about  notice  as a verb. Well  you know what  We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years for worrying about  impact  as a verb and  invite  as a noun. The language is not going to change so fast that we can't keep up. Language just doesn't work that way. I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating  just the way dictionary editors do. I hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust. So how does a word get into a dictionary  It gets in because we use it and we keep using it  and dictionary editors are paying attention to us. If you're thinking   But that lets all of us decide what words mean   I would say   Yes it does  and it always has.  Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource  but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean. If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means  it's real. That word might be slangy  that word might be informal  that word might be a word that you think is illogical or unnecessary  but that word that we're using  that word is real. Thank you. Think of a hard choice you'll face in the near future. It might be between two careers    artist and accountant    or places to live    the city or the country    or even between two people to marry    you could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita. Or it might be a choice about whether to have children  to have an ailing parent move in with you  to raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by but leaves you cold. Or whether to donate your life savings to charity. Chances are  the hard choice you thought of was something big  something momentous  something that matters to you. Hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing  hand wringing  the gnashing of teeth. But I think we've misunderstood hard choices and the role they play in our lives. Understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses. What makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate. In any easy choice  one alternative is better than the other. In a hard choice  one alternative is better in some ways  the other alternative is better in other ways  and neither is better than the other overall. You agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country because staying is better in some ways  moving is better in others  and neither is better than the other overall. We shouldn't think that all hard choices are big. Let's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast. You could have high fiber bran cereal or a chocolate donut. Suppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness. The cereal is better for you  the donut tastes way better  but neither is better than the other overall  a hard choice. Realizing that small choices can also be hard may make big hard choices seem less intractable. After all  we manage to figure  out what to have for breakfast  so maybe we can figure out whether to stay in the city or uproot for the new job in the country. We also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard because we are stupid. When I graduated from college  I couldn't decide between two careers  philosophy and law. I really loved philosophy. There are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher  and all from the comfort of an armchair. But I came from a modest immigrant family where my idea of luxury was having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich in my school lunchbox  so the thought of spending my whole life sitting around in armchairs just thinking  well  that struck me as the height  of extravagance and frivolity. So I got out my yellow pad  I drew a line down the middle  and I tried my best to think of the reasons for and against each alternative. I remember thinking to myself  if only I knew what my life in each career would be like. If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers  I'd be set. I'd compare them side by side  I'd see that one was better  and the choice would be easy. But I got no DVD  and because I couldn't figure out which was better  I did what many of us do in hard choices  I took the safest option. Fear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer  and as I discovered  lawyering didn't quite fit. It wasn't who I was. So now I'm a philosopher  and I study hard choices  and I can tell you that fear of the unknown  while a common motivational default in dealing with hard choices  rests on a misconception of them. It's a mistake to think that in hard choices  one alternative really is better than the other  but we're too stupid to know which  and since we don't know which  we might as well take the least risky option. Even taking two alternatives side by side with full information  a choice can still be hard. Hard choices are hard not because of us or our ignorance  they're hard because there is no best option. Now  if there's no best option  if the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative over another  then surely the alternatives must be equally good. So maybe the right thing to say in hard choices is that they're between equally good options. But that can't be right. If alternatives are equally good  you should just flip a coin between them  and it seems a mistake to think  here's how you should decide between careers  places to live  people to marry  Flip a coin. There's another reason for thinking that hard choices aren't choices between equally good options. Suppose you have a choice between two jobs  you could be an investment banker or a graphic artist. There are a variety of things that matter in such a choice  like the excitement of the work  achieving financial security  having time to raise a family  and so on. Maybe the artist's career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of pictorial expression. Maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation. Imagine the two jobs however you like so that neither is better than the other. Now suppose we improve one of them a bit. Suppose the bank  wooing you  adds     dollars a month to your salary. Does the extra money now make the banking job better than the artist one  Not necessarily. A higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before  but it might not be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist. But if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn't make it better than the other  then the two original jobs could not have been equally good. If you start with two things that are equally good  and you improve one of them  it now must be better than the other. That's not the case with options in hard choices. So now we've got a puzzle. We've got two jobs. Neither is better than the other  nor are they equally good. So how are we supposed to choose  Something seems to have gone wrong here. Maybe the choice itself is problematic and comparison is impossible. But that can't be right. It's not like we're trying to choose between two things that can't be compared. We're weighing the merits of two jobs  after all  not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs. A comparison of the overall merits of two jobs is something we can make  and one we often do make. I think the puzzle arises because of an unreflective assumption we make about value. We unwittingly assume that values like justice  beauty  kindness  are akin to scientific quantities  like length  mass and weight. Take any comparative question not involving value  such as which of two suitcases is heavier. There are only three possibilities. The weight of one is greater  lesser or equal to the weight of the other. Properties like weight can be represented by real numbers    one  two  three and so on    and there are only three possible comparisons between any two real numbers. One number is greater  lesser  or equal to the other. Not so with values. As post Enlightenment creatures  we tend to assume that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world  but the world of value is different from the world of science. The stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers. The stuff of the other world can't. We shouldn't assume that the world of is  of lengths and weights  has the same structure as the world of ought  of what we should do. So if what matters to us    a child's delight  the love you have for your partner   can't be represented by real numbers  then there's no reason to believe that in choice  there are only three possibilities    that one alternative is better  worse or equal to the other. We need to introduce a new  fourth relation beyond being better  worse or equal  that describes what's going on in hard choices. I like to say that the alternatives are  on a par.  When alternatives are on a par  it may matter very much which you choose  but one alternative isn't better than the other. Rather  the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value  in the same league of value  while at the same time being very different in kind of value. That's why the choice is hard. Understanding hard choices in this way uncovers something about ourselves we didn't know. Each of us has the power to create reasons. Imagine a world in which every choice you face is an easy choice  that is  there's always a best alternative. If there's a best alternative  then that's the one you should choose  because part of being rational is doing the better thing rather than the worse thing  choosing what you have most reason to choose. In such a world  we'd have most reason to wear black socks instead of pink socks  to eat cereal instead of donuts  to live in the city rather than the country  to marry Betty instead of Lolita. A world full of only easy choices would enslave us to reasons. When you think about it  it's nuts to believe that the reasons given to you dictated that you had most reason to pursue the exact hobbies you do  to live in the exact house you do  to work at the exact job you do. Instead  you faced alternatives that were on a par   hard choices   and you made reasons for yourself to choose that hobby  that house and that job. When alternatives are on a par  the reasons given to us  the ones that determine whether we're making a mistake  are silent as to what to do. It's here  in the space of hard choices  that we get to exercise our normative power  the power to create reasons for yourself  to make yourself into the kind of person for whom country living is preferable to the urban life. When we choose between options that are on a par  we can do something really rather remarkable. We can put our very selves behind an option. Here's where I stand. Here's who I am. I am for banking. I am for chocolate donuts. This response in hard choices is a rational response  but it's not dictated by reasons given to us. Rather  it's supported by reasons created by us. When we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that  we wholeheartedly become the people that we are. You might say that we become the authors of our own lives. So when we face hard choices  we shouldn't beat our head against a wall trying to figure out which alternative is better. There is no best alternative. Instead of looking for reasons out there  we should be looking for reasons in here  Who am I to be  You might decide to be a pink sock wearing  cereal loving  country living banker  and I might decide to be a black sock wearing  urban  donut loving artist. What we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us. Now  people who don't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are drifters. We all know people like that. I drifted into being a lawyer. I didn't put my agency behind lawyering. I wasn't for lawyering. Drifters allow the world to write the story of their lives. They let mechanisms of reward and punishment    pats on the head  fear  the easiness of an option   to determine what they do. So the lesson of hard choices  reflect on what you can put your agency behind  on what you can be for  and through hard choices  become that person. Far from being sources of agony and dread  hard choices are precious opportunities for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition  that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out  and it is here  in the space of hard choices  that we have the power to create reasons for ourselves to become the distinctive people that we are. And that's why hard choices are not a curse but a godsend. Thank you.

I don't know if you've noticed  but there's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs. Do they think  do they feel and  if so  how  So this afternoon  in my limited time  I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that by introducing you to two dogs  both of whom have taken the command  speak  quite literally. The first dog is the first to go  and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner  and the title is  A Dog on His Master.   As young as I look  I am growing older faster than he. Seven to one is the ratio  they tend to say. Whatever the number  I will pass him one day and take the lead  the way I do on our walks in the woods  and if this ever manages to cross his mind  it would be the sweetest shadow I have ever cast on snow or grass.  Thank you. And our next dog speaks in something called the revenant  which means a spirit that comes back to visit you.  I am the dog you put to sleep  as you like to call the needle of oblivion  come back to tell you this simple thing  I never liked you.   When I licked your face  I thought of biting off your nose. When I watched you toweling yourself dry  I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap. I resented the way you moved  your lack of animal grace  the way you would sit in a chair to eat  a napkin on your lap  a knife in your hand. I would have run away but I was too weak  a trick you taught me while I was learning to sit and heel and  greatest of insults  shake hands without a hand. I admit the sight of the leash would excite me  but only because it meant I was about to smell things you had never touched. You do not want to believe this  but I have no reason to lie  I hated the car  hated the rubber toys  disliked your friends  and worse  your relatives. The jingling of my tags drove me mad. You always scratched me in the wrong place.   All I ever wanted from you was food and water in my bowls. While you slept  I watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky. It took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl. Now  I am free of the collar  free of the yellow raincoat  monogrammed sweater  the absurdity of your lawn  and that is all you need to know about this place  except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner  that everyone here can read and write  the dogs in poetry  the cats and all the others in prose.  Thank you. Twenty three years ago  at the age of     I shot and killed a man. I was a young drug dealer with a quick temper and a semi automatic pistol. But that wasn't the end of my story. In fact  it was beginning  and the    years since is a story of acknowledgment  apology and atonement. But it didn't happen in the way that you might imagine or think. These things occurred in my life in a way that was surprising  especially to me. See  like many of you  growing up  I was an honor roll student  a scholarship student  with dreams of becoming a doctor. But things went dramatically wrong when my parents separated and eventually divorced. The actual events are pretty straightforward. At the age of     I got shot three times standing on the corner of my block in Detroit. My friend rushed me to the hospital. Doctors pulled the bullets out  patched me up  and sent me back to the same  neighborhood where I got shot. Throughout this ordeal  no one hugged me  no one counseled me  no one told me I would be okay. No one told me that I would live in fear  that I would become paranoid  or that I would react hyper violently to being shot. No one told me that one day  I would become the person behind the trigger. Fourteen months later  at   a.m.  I fired the shots that caused a man's death. When I entered prison  I was bitter  I was angry  I was hurt. I didn't want to take responsibility. I blamed everybody from my parents to the system. I rationalized my decision to shoot because in the hood where I come from  it's better to be the shooter than the person getting shot. As I sat in my cold cell  I felt helpless  unloved and abandoned. I felt like nobody cared  and I reacted with hostility to my confinement. And I found myself getting deeper and deeper into trouble. I ran black market stores  I loan sharked  and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled into the prison. I had in fact become what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called  the worst of the worst.  And because of my activity  I landed in solitary confinement for seven and a half years out of my incarceration. Now as I see it  solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself  but find myself I did. One day  I was pacing my cell  when an officer came and delivered mail. I looked at a couple of letters before I looked at the letter that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it. And anytime I would get a letter from my son  it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine. And on this particular day  I opened this letter  and in capital letters  he wrote   My mama told me why you was in prison  murder.  He said   Dad  don't kill. Jesus watches what you do. Pray to Him.  Now  I wasn't religious at that time  nor am I religious now  but it was something so profound about my son's words. They made me examine things about my life that I hadn't considered. It was the first time in my life that I had actually thought about the fact that my son would see me as a murderer. I sat back on my bunk and I reflected on something I had read in  Plato   where Socrates stated in  Apology  that the unexamined life isn't worth living. At that point is when the transformation began. But it didn't come easy. One of the things I realized  which was part of the transformation  was that there were four key things. The first thing was  I had great mentors. Now  I know some of you all are probably thinking  how did you find a great mentor in prison  But in my case  some of my mentors who are serving life sentences were some of the best people to ever come into my life  because they forced me to look at my life honestly  and they forced me to challenge myself about my decision making. The second thing was literature. Prior to going to prison  I didn't know that there were so many brilliant black poets  authors and philosophers  and then I had the great fortune of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography  and it shattered every stereotype I had about myself. The third thing was family. For    years  my father stood by my side with an unshakable faith  because he believed that I had what it took to turn my life around. I also met an amazing woman who is now the mother of my two year old son Sekou  and she taught me how to love myself in a healthy way. The final thing was writing. When I got that letter from my son  I began to write a journal about things I had experienced in my childhood and in prison  and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement. Earlier in my incarceration  I had received a letter from one of the relatives of my victim  and in that letter  she told me she forgave me  because she realized I was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships and just made a series of poor decisions. It was the first time in my life that I ever felt open to forgiving myself. One of the things that happened after that experience is that I thought about the other men who were incarcerated alongside of me  and how much I wanted to share this with them. And so I started talking to them about some of their experiences  and I was devastated to realize that most of them came from the same abusive environments  And most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it around  but unfortunately the system that currently holds  .  million people in prison is designed to warehouse as opposed to rehabilitate or transform. So I made it up in my mind that if I was ever released from prison that I would do everything in my power to help change that. In       I walked out of prison for the first time after two decades. Now imagine  if you will  Fred Flintstone walking into an episode of  The Jetsons.  That was pretty much what my life was like. For the first time  I was exposed to the Internet  social media  cars that talk like KITT from  Knight Rider.  But the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology. See  when I went to prison  our car phones were this big and required two people to carry them. So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed my little Blackberry and I started learning how to text. But the thing is  the people around me  they didn't realize that I had no idea what all these abbreviated texts meant  like LOL  OMG  LMAO  until one day I was having a conversation with one of my friends via text  and I asked him to do something  and he responded back   K.  And I was like   What is K   And he was like   K is okay.  So in my head  I was like   Well what the hell is wrong with K   And so I text him a question mark. And he said   K   okay.  And so I tap back   FU.   Laughter  And then he texts back  and he asks me why was I cussing him out. And I said   LOL FU   as in  I finally understand. And so fast forward three years  I'm doing relatively good. I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab  I work for an amazing company called BMe  I teach at the University of Michigan  but it's been a struggle because I realize that there are more men and women coming home who are not going to be afforded those opportunities. I've been blessed to work with some amazing men and women  helping others reenter society  and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans. He served    years for a crime he didn't commit. He's    years old. He's currently enrolled in college. And one of the things that we talked about is the three things that I found important in my personal transformation  the first being acknowledgment. I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others. I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt. The second thing was apologizing. I had to apologize to the people I had hurt. Even though I had no expectations of them accepting it  it was important to do because it was the right thing. But I also had to apologize to myself. The third thing was atoning. For me  atoning meant going back into my community and working with at risk youth who were on the same path  but also becoming at one with myself. Through my experience of being locked up  one of the things I discovered is this  the majority of men and women who are incarcerated are redeemable  and the fact is     percent of the men and women who are incarcerated will at some point return to the community  and we have a role in determining what kind of men and women return to our community. My wish today is that we will embrace a more empathetic approach toward how we deal with mass incarceration  that we will do away with the lock them up and throw away the key mentality  because it's proven it doesn't work. My journey is a unique journey  but it doesn't have to be that way. Anybody can have a transformation if we create the space for that to happen. So what I'm asking today is that you envision a world where men and women aren't held hostage to their pasts  where misdeeds and mistakes don't define you for the rest of your life. I think collectively  we can create that reality  and I hope you do too. Thank you. I am a computer science and engineering professor here at Carnegie Mellon  and my research focuses on usable privacy and security  and so my friends like to give me examples of their frustrations with computing systems  especially frustrations related to unusable privacy and security. So passwords are something that I hear a lot about. A lot of people are frustrated with passwords  and it's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess. But what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems  It's tough. At Carnegie Mellon  they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords. The password requirement up through      was just that you had to have a password with at least one character. Pretty easy. But then they changed things  and at the end of       they announced that we were going to have a new policy  and this new policy required passwords that were at least eight characters long  with an uppercase letter  lowercase letter  a digit  a symbol  you couldn't use the same character more than three times  and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary. Now  when they implemented this new policy  a lot of people  my colleagues and friends  came up to me and they said   Wow  now that's really unusable. Why are they doing this to us  and why didn't you stop them   And I said   Well  you know what  They didn't ask me.  But I got curious  and I decided to go talk to the people in charge of our computer systems and find out what led them to introduce this new policy  and they said that the university had joined a consortium of universities  and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that complied with some new requirements  and these requirements were that our passwords had to have a lot of entropy. Now entropy is a complicated term  but basically it measures the strength of passwords. But the thing is  there isn't actually a standard measure of entropy. Now  the National Institute of Standards and Technology has a set of guidelines which have some rules of thumb for measuring entropy  but they don't have anything too specific  and the reason they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they don't actually have any good data on passwords. In fact  their report states   Unfortunately  we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules. NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose  but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others.  So this is a problem  but our research group looked at it as an opportunity. We said   Well  there's a need for good password data. Maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here. So the first thing we did is  we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and talked to students  faculty and staff  and asked them for information about their passwords. Now we didn't say   Give us your password.  No  we just asked them about their password. How long is it  Does it have a digit  Does it have a symbol  And were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week  So we got results from     students  faculty and staff  and indeed we confirmed that the new policy was very annoying  but we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords. We found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down  and only    percent of them did  but disturbingly     percent of people said they were reusing their password. Now  this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down  because it makes you much more susceptible to attackers. So if you have to  write your passwords down  but don't reuse them. We also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords. So CMU allows    possible symbols  but as you can see  there's only a small number that most people are using  so we're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords. So this was a really interesting study  and now we had data from     people  but in the scheme of things  that's really not very much password data  and so we looked around to see where could we find additional password data  So it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords  and they often go and post these passwords on the Internet. So we were able to get access to some of these stolen password sets. This is still not really ideal for research  though  because it's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from  or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords. So we wanted to find some better source of data. So we decided that one thing we could do is we could do a study and have people actually create passwords for our study. So we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk  and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute  a few minutes  an hour  and pay people  a penny  ten cents  a few dollars  to do a task for you  and then you pay them through Amazon.com. So we paid people about    cents to create a password following our rules and answering a survey  and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log in using their password and answering another survey. So we did this  and we collected       passwords  and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with. So some people had a pretty easy policy  we call it Basic   and here the only rule was that your password had to have at least eight characters. Then some people had a much harder policy  and this was very similar to the CMU policy  that it had to have eight characters including uppercase  lowercase  digit  symbol  and pass a dictionary check. And one of the other policies we tried  and there were a whole bunch more  but one of the ones we tried was called Basic    and the only requirement here was that your password had to have at least    characters. All right  so now we had       passwords  and so we had much more detailed information. Again we see that there's only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords. We also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating  but as you may recall  there isn't a good measure of password strength. So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using  or that we could find information about in the research literature. So to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords  they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form  called a hash  and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess as to what a password is  run it through a hashing function  and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list. So a dumb attacker will try every password in order. They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB  and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have. A smart attacker  on the other hand  does something much more clever. They look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets  and they guess those first. So they're going to start by guessing  password   and then they'll guess  I love you   and  monkey   and             because these are the passwords that are most likely for people to have. In fact  some of you probably have these passwords. So what we found by running all of these       passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were  we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong  and the complex passwords were pretty strong too. However  when we looked at the survey data  we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords  and the long passwords were a lot more usable  and in some cases  they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords. So this suggests that  instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords  we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords. Now here's the problem  though  Some people had long passwords that actually weren't very strong. You can make long passwords that are still the sort of thing that an attacker could easily guess. So we need to do more than just say long passwords. There has to be some additional requirements  and some of our ongoing research is looking at what additional requirements we should add to make for stronger passwords that also are going to be easy for people to remember and type. Another approach to getting people to have stronger passwords is to use a password meter. Here are some examples. You may have seen these on the Internet when you were creating passwords. We decided to do a study to find out whether these password meters actually work. Do they actually help people have stronger passwords  and if so  which ones are better  So we tested password meters that were different sizes  shapes  colors  different words next to them  and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny. As you type a better password  the bunny dances faster and faster. So this was pretty fun. What we found was that password meters do work. Most of the password meters were actually effective  and the dancing bunny was very effective too  but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and said you were doing a good job  and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the Internet today are too soft. They tell you you're doing a good job too early  and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback  you probably would have better passwords. Now another approach to better passwords  perhaps  is to use pass phrases instead of passwords. So this was an xkcd cartoon  from a couple of years ago  and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases  and if you look at the second row of this cartoon  you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase  correct horse battery staple  would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember. He says  in fact  you've already remembered it. And so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not. In fact  everybody who I talk to  who I mention I'm doing password research  they point out this cartoon.  Oh  have you seen it  That xkcd. Correct horse battery staple.  So we did the research study to see what would actually happen. So in our study  we used Mechanical Turk again  and we had the computer pick the random words in the pass phrase. Now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words. If we asked a human to do it  they would pick things that were not very random. So we tried a few different conditions. In one condition  the computer picked from a dictionary of the very common words in the English language  and so you'd get pass phrases like  try there three come.  And we looked at that  and we said   Well  that doesn't really seem very memorable.  So then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech  so how about noun verb adjective noun. That comes up with something that's sort of sentence like. So you can get a pass phrase like  plan builds sure power  or  end determines red drug.  And these seemed a little bit more memorable  and maybe people would like those a little bit better. We wanted to compare them with passwords  and so we had the computer pick random passwords  and these were nice and short  but as you can see  they don't really look very memorable. And then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password. So here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable  like  tufritvi  and  vadasabi.  That one kind of rolls off your tongue. So these were random passwords that were generated by our computer. So what we found in this study was that  surprisingly  pass phrases were not actually all that good. People were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords  and because the pass phrases are longer  they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in. So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases. Sorry  all of you xkcd fans. On the other hand  we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well  and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better. So one of the problems with some of the studies that we've done is that because they're all done using Mechanical Turk  these are not people's real passwords. They're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our study. And we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords. So we talked to the information security office at Carnegie Mellon and asked them if we could have everybody's real passwords. Not surprisingly  they were a little bit reluctant to share them with us  but we were actually able to work out a system with them where they put all of the real passwords for        CMU students  faculty and staff  into a locked computer in a locked room  not connected to the Internet  and they ran code on it that we wrote to analyze these passwords. They audited our code. They ran the code. And so we never actually saw anybody's password. We got some interesting results  and those of you Tepper students in the back will be very interested in this. So we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually  .  times stronger than those affiliated with the business school. We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well. The other interesting thing that we found is that when we compared the Carnegie Mellon passwords to the Mechanical Turk generated passwords  there was actually a lot of similarities  and so this helped validate our research method and show that actually  collecting passwords using these Mechanical Turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords. So that was good news. Okay  I want to close by talking about some insights I gained while on sabbatical last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school. One of the things that I did is I made a number of quilts  and I made this quilt here. It's called  Security Blanket.  And this quilt has the       most frequent passwords stolen from the RockYou website. And the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset. And what I did is I created this word cloud  and I went through all       words  and I categorized them into loose thematic categories. And it was  in some cases  it was kind of difficult to figure out what category they should be in  and then I color coded them. So here are some examples of the difficulty. So  justin.  Is that the name of the user  their boyfriend  their son  Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan. Or  princess.  Is that a nickname  Are they Disney princess fans  Or maybe that's the name of their cat.  Iloveyou  appears many times in many different languages. There's a lot of love in these passwords. If you look carefully  you'll see there's also some profanity  but it was really interesting to me to see that there's a lot more love than hate in these passwords. And there are animals  a lot of animals  and  monkey  is the most common animal and the   th most popular password overall. And this was really curious to me  and I wondered   Why are monkeys so popular   And so in our last password study  any time we detected somebody creating a password with the word  monkey  in it  we asked them why they had a monkey in their password. And what we found out    we found    people so far  I think  who have the word  monkey     We found out about a third of them said they have a pet named  monkey  or a friend whose nickname is  monkey   and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute. And that guy is really cute. So it seems that at the end of the day  when we make passwords  we either make something that's really easy to type  a common pattern  or things that remind us of the word password or the account that we've created the password for  or whatever. Or we think about things that make us happy  and we create our password based on things that make us happy. And while this makes typing and remembering your password more fun  it also makes it a lot easier to guess your password. So I know a lot of these TED Talks are inspirational and they make you think about nice  happy things  but when you're creating your password  try to think about something else. Thank you. Every day we face issues like climate change or the safety of vaccines where we have to answer questions whose answers rely heavily on scientific information. Scientists tell us that the world is warming. Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe. But how do we know if they are right  Why should be believe the science  The fact is  many of us actually don't believe the science. Public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportions of the American people don't believe the climate is warming due to human activities  don't think that there is evolution by natural selection  and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines. So why should we believe the science  Well  scientists don't like talking about  science as a matter of belief. In fact  they would contrast science with faith  and they would say belief is the domain of faith. And faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science. Indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager. Blaise Pascal was a   th century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in God  and his wager went like this  Well  if God doesn't exist but I decide to believe in him nothing much is really lost. Maybe a few hours on Sunday. But if he does exist and I don't believe in him  then I'm in deep trouble. And so Pascal said  we'd better believe in God. Or as one of my college professors said   He clutched for the handrail of faith.  He made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind. Now the fact is though  for most of us  most scientific claims are a leap of faith. We can't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases. And indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties. So if you think about it  a geologist can't tell you whether a vaccine is safe. Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory. A physicist cannot tell you  despite the claims of some of them  whether or not tobacco causes cancer. So  if even scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own fields  then why do they accept the claims of other scientists  Why do they believe each other's claims  And should we believe those claims  So what I'd like to argue is yes  we should  but not for the reason that most of us think. Most of us were taught in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method. We were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims. The method that most of us were taught in school  we can call it the textbook method  is the hypothetical deductive method. According to the standard model  the textbook model  scientists develop hypotheses  they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses  and then they go out into the world and they say   Okay  well are those consequences true   Can we observe them taking place in the natural world  And if they are true  then the scientists say   Great  we know the hypothesis is correct.  So there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this. One of the most famous examples comes from the work of Albert Einstein. When Einstein developed the theory of general relativity  one of the consequences of his theory was that space time wasn't just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric. And that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun. So if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it. That was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to test it but they did test it in       and lo and behold it turned out to be true. Starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun. This was a huge confirmation of the theory. It was considered proof of the truth of this radical new idea  and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe. Now  sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the deductive nomological model  mainly because academics like  to make things complicated. But also because in the ideal case  it's about laws. So nomological means having to do with laws. And in the ideal case  the hypothesis isn't just an idea  ideally  it is a law of nature. Why does it matter that it is a law of nature  Because if it is a law  it can't be broken. If it's a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances are. And all of you know of at least one example of a famous law  Einstein's famous equation  E MC   which tells us what the relationship is between energy and mass. And that relationship is true no matter what. Now  it turns out  though  that there  are several problems with this model. The main problem is that it's wrong. It's just not true.  Laughter  And I'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong. So the first reason is a logical reason. It's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent. So that's another fancy  academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions. So just because the prediction comes true doesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct. And I have a good example of that too   again from the history of science. This is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe with the Earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it. The Ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries. Well  why  Well the answer is because it made  lots of predictions that came true. The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet  in fact more accurate predictions at first than the Copernican theory which we now would say is true. So that's one problem with the textbook model. A second problem is a practical problem  and it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that they're making. So an important example of this comes from the Copernican model  which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system. So when Nicolaus Copernicus said  actually the Earth is not the center of the universe  the sun is the center of the solar system  the Earth moves around the sun. Scientists said  well okay  Nicolaus  if that's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the Earth around the sun. And so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallax. And astronomers said  if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star  let's say  Sirius    well I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars  but imagine you're out in the country   imagine you chose that rural life   and we look at a star in December  we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. If we now make the same observation six months later when the Earth has moved to this position in June  we look at that same star and we  see it against a different backdrop. That difference  that angular difference  is the stellar parallax. So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes. Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found nothing  nothing at all. And many people argued that this proved  that the Copernican model was false. So what happened  Well  in hindsight we can say  that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses  both of which we would now say were incorrect. The first was an assumption  about the size of the Earth's orbit. Astronomers were assuming  that the Earth's orbit was large relative to the distance to the stars. Today we would draw the picture more like this  this comes from NASA  and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small. In fact  it's actually much smaller even than shown here. The stellar parallax therefore  is very small and actually very hard to detect. And that leads to the second reason why the prediction didn't work  because scientists were also assuming that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallax. And that turned out not to be true. It wasn't until the   th century that scientists were able to detect the stellar parallax. So  there's a third problem as well. The third problem is simply a factual problem  that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model. A lot of science isn't deductive at all  it's actually inductive. And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily start with theories and hypotheses  often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world. And the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived  Charles Darwin. When Darwin went out as a young  man on the voyage of the Beagle  he didn't have a hypothesis  he didn't have a theory. He just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data. Mainly he knew that he hated medicine because the sight of blood made him sick so he had to have an alternative career path. So he started collecting data. And he collected many things   including his famous finches. When he collected these finches  he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant. Many years later back in London  Darwin looked at his data again and began to develop an explanation  and that explanation was the theory of natural selection. Besides inductive science  scientists also often participate in modeling. One of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things. And how do we do that  Well  one way you can do it is to build a model that tests an idea. So this is a picture of Henry Cadell  who was a Scottish geologist in the   th century. You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots. And Cadell wanted to answer the question  how are mountains formed  And one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains like the Appalachians  you often find that the rocks in them are folded  and they're folded in a particular way  which suggested to him that they were actually being compressed from the side. And this idea would later play a major role in discussions of continental drift. So he built this model  this crazy contraption with levers and wood  and here's his wheelbarrow  buckets  a big sledgehammer. I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots. Maybe it's going to rain. And he created this physical model in order to demonstrate that you could  in fact  create patterns in rocks  or at least  in this case  in mud  that looked a lot like mountains if you compressed them from the side. So it was an argument about the cause of mountains. Nowadays  most scientists prefer to work inside  so they don't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations. But a computer simulation is a kind of a model. It's a model that's made with mathematics  and like the physical models of the   th century  it's very important for thinking about causes. So one of the big questions to do with climate change  we have tremendous amounts of evidence that the Earth is warming up. This slide here  the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last     years showing that the Earth's temperature has steadily increased  and you can see in particular that in the last    years there's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade  or almost two degrees Fahrenheit. So what  though  is driving that change  How can we know what's causing the observed warming  Well  scientists can model it using a computer simulation. So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the Earth's climate  so sulfate particles from air pollution  volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions  changes in solar radiation  and  of course  greenhouse gases. And they asked the question  what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life  So here is the real life in black. Here's the model in this light gray  and the answer is a model that includes  it's the answer E on that SAT  all of the above. The only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together  including greenhouse gases  and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last    years. And so this is why climate scientists say it's not just that we know that climate change is happening  we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason why. So now because there all these different things that scientists do  the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said   The only principle in science that doesn't inhibit progress is  anything goes.  Now this quotation has often been taken out of context  because Feyerabend was not actually saying that in science anything goes. What he was saying was  actually the full quotation is   If you press me to say what is the method of science  I would have to say  anything goes.  What he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things. Scientists are creative. But then this pushes the question back  If scientists don't use a single method  then how do they decide what's right and what's wrong  And who judges  And the answer is  scientists judge  and they judge by judging evidence. Scientists collect evidence in many different ways  but however they collect it  they have to subject it to scrutiny. And this led the sociologist Robert Merton to focus on this question of how scientists scrutinize data and evidence  and he said they do it in a way he called  organized skepticism.  And by that he meant it's organized because they do it collectively  they do it as a group  and skepticism  because they do it from a position of distrust. That is to say  the burden of proof is on the person with a novel claim. And in this sense  science is intrinsically conservative. It's quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say   Yes  we know something  this is true.  So despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts  what we find is that actually  really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively rare in the history of science. So finally that brings us to one more idea  If scientists judge evidence collectively  this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus  and to say that at the end of the day  what science is  what scientific knowledge is  is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized scrutiny  collective scrutiny  have judged the evidence and come to a conclusion about it  either yea or nay. So we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts. We can also think of science as being a kind of a jury  except it's a very special kind of jury. It's not a jury of your peers  it's a jury of geeks. It's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s  and unlike a conventional jury  which has only two choices  guilty or not guilty  the scientific jury actually has a number of choices. Scientists can say yes  something's true. Scientists can say no  it's false. Or  they can say  well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evidence. Or  they can say it might be true  but we don't know how to answer the question and we're going to put it aside and maybe we'll come back to it later. That's what scientists call  intractable.  But this leads us to one final problem  If science is what scientists say it is  then isn't that just an appeal to authority  And weren't we all taught in school that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy  Well  here's the paradox of modern science  the paradox of the conclusion I think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to  that actually science is the appeal to authority  but it's not the authority of the individual  no matter how smart that individual is  like Plato or Socrates or Einstein. It's the authority of the collective community. You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd  but a very special kind of crowd. Science does appeal to authority  but it's not based on any individual  no matter how smart that individual may be. It's based on the collective wisdom  the collective knowledge  the collective work  of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem. Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust  this  show me  culture  illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence. Of course  these people don't really look like scientists  because they're much too happy. Okay  so that brings me to my final point. Most of us get up in the morning. Most of us trust our cars. Well  see  now I'm thinking  I'm in Manhattan  this is a bad analogy  but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition  and their cars work  and they work incredibly well. The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down. So why is that  Why do cars work so well  It's not because of the genius of Henry Ford or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk. It's because the modern automobile is the product of more than     years of work by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people. The modern automobile is the product of the collected work and wisdom and experience of every man and woman who has ever worked on a car  and the reliability of the technology is the result of that accumulated effort. We benefit not just from the genius of Benz and Ford and Musk but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the modern car. And the same is true of science  only science is even older. Our basis for trust in science is actually the same as our basis in trust in technology  and the same as our basis for trust in anything  namely  experience. But it shouldn't be blind trust any more than we would have blind trust in anything. Our trust in science  like science itself  should be based on evidence  and that means that scientists have to become better communicators. They have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it  and it means that we have to become better listeners. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you about one thing and just one thing only  and this has to do with when people ask me  what do you do  To which I usually respond  I do computer music. Now  a number of people just stop talking to me right then and there  and the rest who are left usually have this blank look in their eye  as if to say  what does that mean  And I feel like I'm actually depriving them of information by telling them this  at which point I usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind  which is  I have no idea what I'm doing. Which is true. That's usually followed by a second thought  which is  whatever it is that I'm doing  I love it. And today  I want to  well  share with you something I love  and also why. And I think we'll begin with just this question  What is computer music  And I'm going to try to do my best to provide a definition  maybe by telling you a story that goes through some of the stuff I've been working on. And the first thing  I think  in our story is going to be something called ChucK. Now  ChucK is a programming language for music  and it's open source  it's freely available  and I like to think that it crashes equally well on all modern operating systems. And instead of telling you more about it  I'm just going to give you a demo. By the way  I'm just going to nerd out for just a few minutes here  so I would say  don't freak out. In fact  I would invite all of you to join me in just geeking out. If you've never written a line of code before in your life  do not worry. I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this. First thing I'm going to do is to make a sine wave oscillator  and we're going to called the sine wave generator  Ge.  And then we're going to connect  Ge  to the DAC. Now this is kind of the abstraction for the sound output on my computer. Okay  So I've connected myself into the speaker. Next  I'm going to say my frequency is     hertz  and I'm going to let time advance by two seconds through this operation. All right  so if I were to play this    you would hear a sine wave at     hertz for two seconds. Okay  great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this  and then just change some of these numbers     .       I shall leave it as that  and .  and    . By doubling the frequency  we're actually going up in successive octaves  and then we have this sequence    Okay  great  now I can imagine creating all kinds of really horrible single sine wave pieces of music with this  but I'm going to do something that computers are really good at  which is repetition. I'm going to put this all in a while loop  and you actually don't need to indent  but this is purely for aesthetic reasons. It's good practice. And when we do this   that's going to go on for a while. In fact  it's probably not going to stop until this computer disintegrates. And I can't really empirically prove that to you  but I hope you'll believe me when I say that. Next  I'm going to replace this     by math.random f. I'm going to generate a random number between    and       and send that to the frequency of me. And I'm going to do this every half a second. Let's do this every     milliseconds. One hundred. All right. At this point  we've reached something that I would like to think of as the canonical computer music. This is  to me  the sound that mainframes are supposed to be making when they're thinking really hard. It's this sound  it's like  the square root of five million. So is this computer music  Yeah  I guess by definition  it's kind of computer music. It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to cruising down the highway  but it's a foundation of computer generated music  and using ChucK  we've actually been building instruments in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra  based right here at Stanford Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops  humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays. Now the reason we have these is so that for the instruments that we create out of the laptop  we want the sound to come out of somewhere near the instrument and the performer  kind of much like a traditional  acoustic instrument. Like  if I were to play a violin here  the sound would naturally not come out of the P.A. system  but from the artifact itself. So these speakers are meant to emulate that. In fact  I'm going to show you how we actually built them. The first step is to go to IKEA and buy a salad bowl. This is an    inch Blanda Matt. That's the actual name  and I actually use one of these to make salad at home as well  I kid you not. And the first step is you turn it upside down  and then you drill holes in them  six holes per hemi  and then make a base plate  put car speaker drivers in them along with amplifiers in the enclosure  and you put that all together and you have these hemispherical speaker arrays. Add people  add laptops  you have a laptop orchestra. And what might a laptop orchestra sound like  Well  let me give you a demonstration of about     instruments we've created so far for the Laptop Orchestra. And what I'm going to do is actually come over to this thing. This thing I have in front of me actually used to be a commodity gaming controller called a Gametrak. This thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands. It's tethered to the base  and this will track the position of your hands in real time. It was originally designed as a golfing controller to detect the motion of your swing. That turned out to be a rather large commercial non success  at which point they slashed prices to    dollars  at which point computer music researchers said   This is awesome  We can prototype instruments out of this.  So let me show you one instrument we've created  one of many  and this instrument is called  Twilight   and it's meant to go with this metaphor of pulling a sound out of the ground. So let me see if this will work. And put it back. And then if you go to the left  right  it sounds like an elephant in pain. This is a slightly metallic sound. Turn it just a bit. It's like a hovering car. Okay. This third one is a ratchet like interaction  so let me turn it up. So it's a slightly different interaction. The fourth one is a drone. And finally  let's see  this is a totally different interaction  and I think you have to imagine that there's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage  and I'm going to bang it. So there we go  so that's one of many instruments in the Laptop Orchestra. Thank you. And when you put that together  you get something that sounds like this. Okay  and so  I think from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the Laptop Orchestra  and I think from the curiosity of wondering  what if we took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people  plus then a healthy bout of insanity   put those three things together   led to me actually co founding a startup company in      called Smule. Now Smule's mission is to create expressive  mobile music things  and one of the first musical instruments we created is called Ocarina. And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick. So Ocarina   is based on this ancient flute like instrument called the ocarina  and this one is the four hole English pendant configuration  and you're literally blowing into the microphone to make the sound. And there's actually a little ChucK script running in here that's detecting the strength of your blowing and also synthesizing the sound. And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer  so you can get   All right. So let me play a little ditty for you  a little Bach. And here  you'll hear a little accompaniment with the melody. The accompaniment actually follows the melody  not the other way around. And this was designed to let you take your time and figure out where your expressive space is  and you can just hang out here for a while  for a really dramatic effect  if you want  and whenever you're ready   And on these longer notes  I'm going to use more vibrato towards the end of the notes to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality. Huh  that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on. Thank you. So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is  is this a toy or it an instrument  Maybe it's both  but for me  I think the more important question is  is it expressive  And at the same time  I think creating these types of instruments asks a question about the role of technology  and its place for how we make music. Apparently  for example  not that long ago  like only a hundred years ago   that's not that long in the course of human history   families back then used to make music together as a common form of entertainment. I don't think that's really happening that much anymore. You know  this is before radio  before recording. In the last hundred years  with all this technology  we now have more access to music as listeners and consumers  but somehow  I think we're making less music than ever before. I'm not sure why that would be. Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play. And while listening to music is wonderful  there's a special joy to making music that's all its own. And I think that's one part of the goal of why I do what I do is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right  Now  if that's one goal  the other goal is to look to the future and think about what kind of new musical things can we make that we don't perhaps yet have names for that's enabled by technology  but ultimately might change the way that humans make music. And I'll just give you one example here  and this is Ocarina's other feature. This is a globe  and here you're actually listening to other users of Ocarina blow into their iPhones to play something. This is  G.I.R.  from Texas   R.I.K.  I don't know why it's these three letter names today  Los Angeles. They're all playing pretty  somewhat minimal music here. And the idea with this is that  well  technology should not be foregrounded here  and    Laughter    we've actually opened this up. The first thought is that  hey  you know there's somebody somewhere out there playing some music  and this is a small but I think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords. As a final example  and perhaps my favorite example  is that in the wake of the      earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan  a woman reached out in one of our singing apps to try to get people to join in to sing with her on a version of  Lean on Me.  Now  in these apps  there's this thing that allows any user to add their voice to an existing performance by any other user or group of users  so in some sense  she's created this kind of global ad hoc corral of strangers  and within weeks  thousands of people joined in on this  and you can kind of see people coming from all around the world and all these lines converging on the origin where the first rendition of the song was sung  and that's in Tokyo. And this is what it sounds like  when there's       people. This is       voices.   We all have pain  we all have sorrow     But if we are wise     We know that there's always tomorrow     Lean on me     When you're not strong     And I'll be your friend     I'll help you carry on     For it won't be long     Till I'm gonna need     Somebody to lean on     Just lean on     Is this computer music  Was that computer music  Yeah  I guess so  it's something that you really couldn't have done without computers. But at the same time  it's also just human  and I think what I've essentially answered so far is maybe why I do the stuff that I do  and let's just finally return to the first question  What is computer music  And I think that the catch here is that  at least to me  computer music isn't really about computers. It is about people. It's about how we can use technology to change the way we think and do and make music  and maybe even add to how we can connect with each other through music. And with that  I want to say  this is computer music  and thank you for listening. The human voice  It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world  probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say  I love you.  And yet many people have the experience that when they speak  people don't listen to them. And why is that  How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world  What I'd like to suggest  there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list  but these seven  I think  are pretty large habits that we can all fall into. First  gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit  and we know perfectly well the person gossiping  five minutes later  will be gossiping about us. Second  judging. We know people who are like this in conversation  and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third  negativity. You can fall into this. My mother  in the last years of her life  became very negative  and it's hard to listen. I remember one day  I said to her   It's October   today   and she said   I know  isn't it dreadful   It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. And another form of negativity  complaining. Well  this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather  sport  about politics  about everything  but actually  complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions  and again  hard to listen to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate  the sixth of the seven  embroidery  exaggeration. It demeans our language  actually  sometimes. For example  if I see something that really is awesome  what do I call it  And then  of course  this exaggeration becomes lying  and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally  dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated  you're listening into the wind. You know  somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are  seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this  Yes  there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones  foundations  that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately  these things spell a word. The word is  hail   and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition  to greet or acclaim enthusiastically  which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for  See if you can guess. The H  honesty  of course  being true in what you say  being straight and clear. The A is authenticity  just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth  which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity  being your word  actually doing what you say  and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love  but I do mean wishing people well  for two reasons. First of all  I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean  my goodness  you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love  of course  honesty is a great thing. But also  if you're really wishing somebody well  it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also  now that's what you say  and it's like the old song  it is what you say  it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible  and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with  which will increase the power of your speaking. Register  for example. Now  falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time  but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice  however. So if I talk up here in my nose  you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat  which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight  you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference  We vote for politicians with lower voices  it's true  because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again  the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich  smooth  warm  like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you  that's not the end of the world  because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing  with posture  and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing song  the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word  monotonic  comes from  or monotonous  monotone. Also  we have repetitive prosody now coming in  where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question  it's a statement  And if you repeat that one  it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody  which I think is a shame  so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying something really quickly  or I can slow right down to emphasize  and at the end of that  of course  is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk  is there  We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course  pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal  but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys  So  slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally  volume. Sorry about that  if I startled anybody. Or  I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting  Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course  where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage  asking for a raise  a wedding speech. Whatever it is  if it's really important  you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on  and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually  let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important  do these. First  arms up  deep breath in  and sigh out  ahhhhh  like that. One more time. Ahhhh  very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips  and we're going to go Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba. Very good. And now  brrrrrrrrrr  just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then  roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally  and if I can only do one  the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with  we  and goes to  aw.  The  we  is high  the  aw  is low. So you go  weeeaawww  weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat  thank you. Next time you speak  do those in advance. Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now  right  We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose  Or to make that a bit larger  what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound  That would be a world that does sound beautiful  and one where understanding would be the norm  and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. This is a lot of ones and zeros. It's what we call binary information. This is how computers talk. It's how they store information. It's how computers think. It's how computers do everything it is that computers do. I'm a cybersecurity researcher  which means my job is to sit down with this information and try to make sense of it  to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean. Unfortunately for me  we're not just talking about the ones and zeros I have on the screen here. We're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros. We're talking about billions and billions of ones and zeros  more than anyone could possibly comprehend. Now  as exciting as that sounds  when I first started doing cyber   when I first started doing cyber  I wasn't sure that sifting through ones and zeros was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life  because in my mind  cyber was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer  it was keeping people's Myspace pages from being hacked  and maybe  maybe on my most glorious day  it was keeping someone's credit card information from being stolen. Those are important things  but that's not how I wanted to spend my life. But after    minutes of work as a defense contractor  I soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off. In fact  in terms of national security  keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer was surprisingly low on their priority list. And the reason for that is cyber is so much bigger than any one of those things. Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives  because computers are an integral part of all of our lives  even if you don't own a computer. Computers control everything in your car  from your GPS to your airbags. They control your phone. They're the reason you can call     and get someone on the other line. They control our nation's entire infrastructure. They're the reason you have electricity  heat  clean water  food. Computers control our military equipment  everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks. All of these things are made possible because of computers  and therefore because of cyber  and when something goes wrong  cyber can make all of these things impossible. But that's where I step in. A big part of my job is defending all of these things  keeping them working  but once in a while  part of my job is to break one of these things  because cyber isn't just about defense  it's also about offense. We're entering an age where we talk about cyberweapons. In fact  so great is the potential for cyber offense that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare. Warfare. It's not necessarily a bad thing. On the one hand  it means we have whole new front on which we need to defend ourselves  but on the other hand  it means we have a whole new way to attack  a whole new way to stop evil people from doing evil things. So let's consider an example of this that's completely theoretical. Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building  and he wants to do this again and again in the future. So he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes. He's going to use a cell phone as a remote detonator. Now  it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist was with a hail of bullets and a car chase  but that's not necessarily true anymore. We're entering an age where we can stop him with the press of a button from       miles away  because whether he knew it or not  as soon as he decided to use his cell phone  he stepped into the realm of cyber. A well crafted cyber attack could break into his phone  disable the overvoltage protections on his battery  drastically overload the circuit  cause the battery to overheat  and explode. No more phone  no more detonator  maybe no more terrorist  all with the press of a button from a thousand miles away. So how does this work  It all comes back to those ones and zeros. Binary information makes your phone work  and used correctly  it can make your phone explode. So when you start to look at cyber from this perspective  spending your life sifting through binary information starts to seem kind of exciting. But here's the catch  This is hard  really  really hard  and here's why. Think about everything you have on your cell phone. You've got the pictures you've taken. You've got the music you listen to. You've got your contacts list  your email  and probably     apps you've never used in your entire life  and behind all of this is the software  the code  that controls your phone  and somewhere  buried inside of that code  is a tiny piece that controls your battery  and that's what I'm really after  but all of this  just a bunch of ones and zeros  and it's all just mixed together. In cyber  we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles  because everything pretty much looks alike. I'm looking for one key piece  but it just blends in with everything else. So let's step back from this theoretical situation of making a terrorist's phone explode  and look at something that actually happened to me. Pretty much no matter what I do  my job always starts with sitting down with a whole bunch of binary information  and I'm always looking for one key piece to do something specific. In this case  I was looking for a very advanced  very high tech piece of code that I knew I could hack  but it was somewhere buried inside of a billion ones and zeroes. Unfortunately for me  I didn't know quite what I was looking for. I didn't know quite what it would look like  which makes finding it really  really hard. When I have to do that  what I have to do is basically look at various pieces of this binary information  try to decipher each piece  and see if it might be what I'm after. So after a while  I thought I had found the piece I was looking for. I thought maybe this was it. It seemed to be about right  but I couldn't quite tell. I couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented. So I spent some time trying to put this together  but wasn't having a whole lot of luck  and finally I decided  I'm going to get through this  I'm going to come in on a weekend  and I'm not going to leave until I figure out what this represents. So that's what I did. I came in on a Saturday morning  and about    hours in  I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle. I just didn't know how they fit together. I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant. At the    hour mark  I started to get a better picture of what was there  but I had a creeping suspicion that what I was looking at was not at all related to what I was looking for. By    hours  the pieces started to come together very slowly    Laughter    and I was pretty sure I was going down the wrong path at this point  but I wasn't going to give up. After    hours in the lab  I figured out exactly what I was looking at  and I was right  it wasn't what I was looking for. I spent    hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten. I wasted    hours of my life searching for this kitten that had nothing at all to do with what I was trying to accomplish. So I was frustrated  I was exhausted. After    hours in the lab  I probably smelled horrible. But instead of just going home and calling it quits  I took a step back and asked myself  what went wrong here  How could I make such a stupid mistake  I'm really pretty good at this. I do this for a living. So what happened  Well I thought  when you're looking at information at this level  it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing. It's easy to not see the forest through the trees. It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole and waste a tremendous amount of time doing the wrong thing. But I had this epiphany. We were looking at the data completely incorrectly since day one. This is how computers think  ones and zeros. It's not how people think  but we've been trying to adapt our minds to think more like computers so that we can understand this information. Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem  we should have been making the problem fit our minds  because our brains have a tremendous potential for analyzing huge amounts of information  just not like this. So what if we could unlock that potential just by translating this to the right kind of information  So with these ideas in mind  I sprinted out of my basement lab at work to my basement lab at home  which looked pretty much the same. The main difference is  at work  I'm surrounded by cyber materials  and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation. At home  I'm surrounded by everything else I've ever learned. So I poured through every book I could find  every idea I'd ever encountered  to see how could we translate a problem from one domain to something completely different  The biggest question was  what do we want to translate it to  What do our brains do perfectly naturally that we could exploit  My answer was vision. We have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information. We can combine color gradients  depth cues  all sorts of these different signals into one coherent picture of the world around us. That's incredible. So if we could find a way to translate these binary patterns to visual signals  we could really unlock the power of our brains to process this stuff. So I started looking at the binary information  and I asked myself  what do I do when I first encounter something like this  And the very first thing I want to do  the very first question I want to answer  is what is this  I don't care what it does  how it works. All I want to know is  what is this  And the way I can figure that out is by looking at chunks  sequential chunks of binary information  and I look at the relationships between those chunks. When I gather up enough of these sequences  I begin to get an idea of exactly what this information must be. So let's go back to that blow up the terrorist's phone situation. This is what English text looks like at a binary level. This is what your contacts list would look like if I were examining it. It's really hard to analyze this at this level  but if we take those same binary chunks that I would be trying to find  and instead translate that to a visual representation  translate those relationships  this is what we get. This is what English text looks like from a visual abstraction perspective. All of a sudden  it shows us all the same information that was in the ones and zeros  but show us it in an entirely different way  a way that we can immediately comprehend. We can instantly see all of the patterns here. It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here  but hours  days  to pick them out in ones and zeros. It takes minutes for anybody to learn what these patterns represent here  but years of experience in cyber to learn what those same patterns represent in ones and zeros. So this piece is caused by lower case letters followed by lower case letters inside of that contact list. This is upper case by upper case  upper case by lower case  lower case by upper case. This is caused by spaces. This is caused by carriage returns. We can go through every little detail of the binary information in seconds  as opposed to weeks  months  at this level. This is what an image looks like from your cell phone. But this is what it looks like in a visual abstraction. This is what your music looks like  but here's its visual abstraction. Most importantly for me  this is what the code on your cell phone looks like. This is what I'm after in the end  but this is its visual abstraction. If I can find this  I can't make the phone explode. I could spend weeks trying to find this in ones and zeros  but it takes me seconds to pick out a visual abstraction like this. One of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information  stuff that we haven't seen before. So I know what English looks like at a binary level  and I know what its visual abstraction looks like  but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life. It would take me weeks just to figure out what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros  but because our brains can instantly pick up and recognize these subtle patterns inside of these visual abstractions  we can unconsciously apply those in new situations. So this is what Russian looks like in a visual abstraction. Because I know what one language looks like  I can recognize other languages even when I'm not familiar with them. This is what a photograph looks like  but this is what clip art looks like. This is what the code on your phone looks like  but this is what the code on your computer looks like. Our brains can pick up on these patterns in ways that we never could have from looking at raw ones and zeros. But we've really only scratched the surface of what we can do with this approach. We've only begun to unlock the capabilities of our minds to process visual information. If we take those same concepts and translate them into three dimensions instead  we find entirely new ways of making sense of information. In seconds  we can pick out every pattern here. we can see the cross associated with code. We can see cubes associated with text. We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts. Things that would take us weeks  months to find in ones and zeroes  are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction  and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it  what we find is that we're capable of processing billions of ones and zeros in a matter of seconds just by using our brain's built in ability to analyze patterns. So this is really nice and helpful  but all this tells me is what I'm looking at. So at this point  based on visual patterns  I can find the code on the phone. But that's not enough to blow up a battery. The next thing I need to find is the code that controls the battery  but we're back to the needle in a stack of needles problem. That code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system. So I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery  but there's a lot of things that are very similar to that. You have code that controls your screen  that controls your buttons  that controls your microphones  so even if I can't find the code for the battery  I bet I can find one of those things. So the next step in my binary analysis process is to look at pieces of information that are similar to each other. It's really  really hard to do at a binary level  but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead  I don't even have to sift through the raw data. All I have to do is wait for the image to light up to see when I'm at similar pieces. I follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs to find exactly what I'm looking for. So at this point in the process  I've located the code responsible for controlling your battery  but that's still not enough to blow up a phone. The last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery. For this  I need to identify very subtle  very detailed relationships within that binary information  another very hard thing to do when looking at ones and zeros. But if we translate that information into a physical representation  we can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work. It can find all the detailed patterns  all the important pieces  for us. It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code work together to control that battery. All of this can be done in a matter of hours  whereas the same process would have taken months in the past. This is all well and good in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation. I wanted to find out if this would really work in the work I do every day. So I was playing around with these same concepts with some of the data I've looked at in the past  and yet again  I was trying to find a very detailed  specific piece of code inside of a massive piece of binary information. So I looked at it at this level  thinking I was looking at the right thing  only to see this doesn't have the connectivity I would have expected for the code I was looking for. In fact  I'm not really sure what this is  but when I stepped back a level and looked at the similarities within the code I saw  this doesn't have similarities like any code that exists out there. I can't even be looking at code. In fact  from this perspective  I could tell  this isn't code. This is an image of some sort. And from here  I can see  it's not just an image  this is a photograph. Now that I know it's a photograph  I've got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information  so in a matter of seconds  we can take this information  shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking at. I saw    Laughter    it was that darn kitten again. All this is enabled because we were able to find a way to translate a very hard problem to something our brains do very naturally. So what does this mean  Well  for kittens  it means no more hiding in ones and zeros. For me  it means no more wasted weekends. For cyber  it means we have a radical new way to tackle the most impossible problems. It means we have a new weapon in the evolving theater of cyber warfare  but for all of us  it means that cyber engineers now have the ability to become first responders in emergency situations. When seconds count  we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys. Thank you. As a scientist  and also as a human being  I've been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder. I think Jason Webley last night called it  conspiring to be part of the magic.  So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist lets me dive deeply into the lives of some truly wondrous creatures that share our planet  fireflies. Now  for many of you  I know that fireflies might conjure up some really great memories  childhood  summertime  even other TED Talks. Maybe something like this. My seduction into the world of fireflies began when I was back in graduate school. One evening  I was sitting out in my backyard in North Carolina  and suddenly  these silent sparks rose up all around me  and I began to wonder  How do these creatures make light  and what's with all this flashing  Are they talking to one another  And what happens after the lights go out  I've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as I've explored this nocturnal world. Now if you've ever seen or even heard about fireflies  then you'll know how magically they can transform our everyday landscape into something ethereal and otherworldly  and this happens around the globe  like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies  or a roadside river that I visited in Japan as it was giving birth to the slow  floating flashes of these Genji fireflies  or in Malaysia  the mangrove trees that I watched blossom nightly not with flowers but with the lights of a thousand     Bleep  Bleep     fireflies  all blinking together in stunning synchrony. These luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder  and they keep me connected to the magic of the natural world. And I find it amazing that they're created by these tiny insects. In person  fireflies are charming. They're charismatic. They've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries. As I've traveled around the world  I've met many thoughtful people who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth for humans to enjoy. Other creatures can enjoy them too. I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so beautifully illuminate the creative improvisation of evolution. They've been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces  natural selection  the struggle for survival  and sexual selection  the struggle for reproductive opportunity. As a firefly junkie  the past    years have been quite an exciting ride. Together with my students at Tufts University and other colleagues  we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies  their courtship and sex lives  their treachery and murder. So today I'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we've brought back from our collective adventures into this hidden world. Fireflies belong to a very beautiful and diverse group of insects  the beetles. Worldwide  there are more than       firefly species  and these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals  that is  different ways to find and attract mates. Around     million years ago  the very first fireflies probably looked like this. They flew during the daytime and they didn't light up. Instead  males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females. In other fireflies  it's only the females who light up. They are attractively plump and wingless  so every night  they climb up onto perches and they glow brightly for hours to attract their flying but unlit males. In still other fireflies  both sexes use quick  bright flashes to find their mates. Here in North America  we have more than     different kinds of firefly that have the remarkable ability to shine energy out from their bodies in the form of light. How do they do that  It seems totally magical  but these bioluminescent signals arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions that happen inside the firefly lantern. The main star is an enzyme called luciferase  which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms around an even smaller molecule called luciferin  in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light. Incredible. But how could these bright lights have benefited some proto firefly  To answer this question  we need to flip back in the family album to some baby pictures. Fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow. They spend the vast majority of their lifetime  up to two years  in this larval form. Their main goal here  like my teenagers  is to eat and grow. And firefly light first originated in these juveniles. Every single firefly larva can light up  even when their adults can't. But what's the point to being so conspicuous  Well  we know that these juveniles make nasty tasting chemicals that help them survive their extended childhood  so we think these lights first evolved as a warning  a neon sign that says   Toxic  Stay away   to any would be predators. It took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates. Driven now by sexual selection  some adult fireflies like this proud male evolved a shiny new glow in the dark lantern that would let them take courtship to a whole new level. These adults only live a few weeks  and now they're single mindedly focused on sex  that is  on propelling their genes into the next firefly generation. So we can follow this male out into the field as he joins hundreds of other males who are all showing off their new courtship signals. It's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of male fireflies. They're flying and flashing their hearts out. I still find it very romantic. But meanwhile  where are all the females  Well  they're lounging down below surveying their options. They have plenty of males to choose from  and these females turn out to be very picky. When a female sees a flash from an especially attractive male  she'll aim her lantern in his direction  and give him a flash back. It's her  come hither  sign. So he flies closer and he flashes again. If she still likes him  they'll strike up a conversation. These creatures speak their love in the language of light. So what exactly do these females consider sexy  We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out. When we tested females using blinking LED lights  we discovered they prefer males who give longer lasting flashes. I know you're wondering  what gives these males their sex appeal  Now we get to see what happens when the lights go out. The first thing we discovered is that once a male and female hook up like this  they stay together all night long  and when we looked inside to see what might be happening  we discovered a surprising new twist to firefly sex. While they're mating  the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm but also a nutrient filled package called a nuptial gift. We can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair. We can actually see the gift   it's shown here in red   as it's being passed from the male to the female. What makes this gift so valuable is that it's packed with protein that the female will use to provision her eggs. So females are keeping their eyes on this prize as they size up potential mates. We discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer  because this bling helps the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring into the next generation. So it's not all sweetness and light. Firefly romance is risky. For the most part  these adult fireflies don't get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores  but somewhere along the line  one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins. This evolutionary flaw  which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner  has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights out into the night with treacherous intent. Dubbed  femme fatales  by Jim Lloyd  another colleague  these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species. So the hunt begins with the predator   she's shown here in the lower left   where she's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey  and here's how it might go. First the prey male flashes   Do you love me   His own female responds   Maybe.  So then he flashes again. But this time  the predator sneaks in a reply that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said. She's not looking for love  she's looking for toxins. If she's good  she can lure this male close enough to reach out and grab him  and he's not just a light snack. Over the next hour  she slowly exsanguinates this male leaving behind just some gory remains. Unable to make their own toxins  these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals. So a firefly vampire  brought to you by natural selection. We still have a lot to learn about fireflies  but it looks like many stories will remain untold  because around the world  firefly populations are blinking out. The main culprit  habitat loss. Pretty much everywhere  the fields and forests  the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive  are giving way to development and to sprawl. Here's another problem  we've conquered darkness  but in the process  we spill so much extra light out into the night that it disrupts the lives of other creatures  and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution because it obscures the signals that they use to find their mates. Do we really need fireflies  After all  they're just one tiny bit of Earth's biodiversity. Yet every time a species is lost  it's like extinguishing a room full of candles one by one. You might not notice when the first few flames flicker out  but in the end  you're left sitting in darkness. As we work together to craft a planetary future  I hope we can find a way to keep these bright lights shining. Thank you. I've been thinking a lot about the world recently and how it's changed over the last            years. Twenty or    years ago  if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died in a remote village in East Asia  it would have been a tragedy for the chicken and its closest relatives  but I don't think there was much possibility of us fearing a global pandemic and the deaths of millions. Twenty or    years ago  if a bank in North America lent too much money to some people who couldn't afford to pay it back and the bank went bust  that was bad for the lender and bad for the borrower  but we didn't imagine it would bring the global economic system to its knees for nearly a decade. This is globalization. This is the miracle that has enabled us to transship our bodies and our minds and our words and our pictures and our ideas and our teaching and our learning around the planet ever faster and ever cheaper. It's brought a lot of bad stuff  like the stuff that I just described  but it's also brought a lot of good stuff. A lot of us are not aware of the extraordinary successes of the Millennium Development Goals  several of which have achieved their targets long before the due date. That proves that this species of humanity is capable of achieving extraordinary progress if it really acts together and it really tries hard. But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days  I sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise  and we've been slow to respond to it. If you look at the downside of globalization  it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming. All of the grand challenges that we face today  like climate change and human rights and demographics and terrorism and pandemics and narco trafficking and human slavery and species loss  I could go on  we're not making an awful lot of progress against an awful lot of those challenges. So in a nutshell  that's the challenge that we all face today at this interesting point in history. That's clearly what we've got to do next. We've somehow got to get our act together and we've got to figure out how to globalize the solutions better so that we don't simply become a species which is the victim of the globalization of problems. Why are we so slow at achieving these advances  What's the reason for it  Well  there are  of course  a number of reasons  but perhaps the primary reason is because we're still organized as a species in the same way that we were organized     or     years ago. There's one superpower left on the planet and that is the seven billion people  the seven billion of us who cause all these problems  the same seven billion  by the way  who will resolve them all. But how are those seven billion organized  They're still organized in     or so nation states  and the nations have governments that make rules and cause us to behave in certain ways. And that's a pretty efficient system  but the problem is that the way that those laws are made and the way those governments think is absolutely wrong for the solution of global problems  because it all looks inwards. The politicians that we elect and the politicians we don't elect  on the whole  have minds that microscope. They don't have minds that telescope. They look in. They pretend  they behave  as if they believed that every country was an island that existed quite happily  independently of all the others on its own little planet in its own little solar system. This is the problem  countries competing against each other  countries fighting against each other. This week  as any week you care to look at  you'll find people actually trying to kill each other from country to country  but even when that's not going on  there's competition between countries  each one trying to shaft the next. This is clearly not a good arrangement. We clearly need to change it. We clearly need to find ways of encouraging countries to start working together a little bit better. And why won't they do that  Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards  Well  the first and most obvious reason is because that's what we ask them to do. That's what we tell them to do. When we elect governments or when we tolerate unelected governments  we're effectively telling them that what we want is for them to deliver us in our country a certain number of things. We want them to deliver prosperity  growth  competitiveness  transparency  justice and all of those things. So unless we start asking our governments to think outside a little bit  to consider the global problems that will finish us all if we don't start considering them  then we can hardly blame them if what they carry on doing is looking inwards  if they still have minds that microscope rather than minds that telescope. That's the first reason why things tend not to change. The second reason is that these governments  just like all the rest of us  are cultural psychopaths. I don't mean to be rude  but you know what a psychopath is. A psychopath is a person who  unfortunately for him or her  lacks the ability to really empathize with other human beings. When they look around  they don't see other human beings with deep  rich  three dimensional personal lives and aims and ambitions. What they see is cardboard cutouts  and it's very sad and it's very lonely  and it's very rare  fortunately. But actually  aren't most of us not really so very good at empathy  Oh sure  we're very good at empathy when it's a question of dealing with people who kind of look like us and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray and wear like us  but when it comes to people who don't do that  who don't quite dress like us and don't quite pray like us and don't quite talk like us  do we not also have a tendency to see them ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too  And this is a question we need to ask ourselves. I think constantly we have to monitor it. Are we and our politicians to a degree cultural psychopaths  The third reason is hardly worth mentioning because it's so silly  but there's a belief amongst governments that the domestic agenda and the international agenda are incompatible and always will be. This is just nonsense. In my day job  I'm a policy adviser. I've spent the last    years or so advising governments around the world  and in all of that time I have never once seen a single domestic policy issue that could not be more imaginatively  effectively and rapidly resolved than by treating it as an international problem  looking at the international context  comparing what others have done  bringing in others  working externally instead of working internally. And so you may say  well  given all of that  why then doesn't it work  Why can we not make our politicians change  Why can't we demand them  Well I  like a lot of us  spend a lot of time complaining about how hard it is to make people change  and I don't think we should fuss about it. I think we should just accept that we are an inherently conservative species. We don't like to change. It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons. We probably wouldn't still be here today if we weren't so resistant to change. It's very simple  Many thousands of years ago  we discovered that if we carried on doing the same things  we wouldn't die  because the things that we've done before by definition didn't kill us  and therefore as long as we carry on doing them  we'll be okay  and it's very sensible not to do anything new  because it might kill you. But of course  there are exceptions to that. Otherwise  we'd never get anywhere. And one of the exceptions  the interesting exception  is when you can show to people that there might be some self interest in them making that leap of faith and changing a little bit. So I've spent a lot of the last    or    years trying to find out what could be that self interest that would encourage not just politicians but also businesses and general populations  all of us  to start to think a little more outwardly  to think in a bigger picture  not always to look inwards  sometimes to look outwards. And this is where I discovered something quite important. In       I launched a study called the Nation Brands Index. What it is  it's a very large scale study that polls a very large sample of the world's population  a sample that represents about    percent of the planet's population  and I started asking them a series of questions about how they perceive other countries. And the Nation Brands Index over the years has grown to be a very  very large database. It's about     billion data points tracking what ordinary people think about other countries and why. Why did I do this  Well  because the governments that I advise are very  very keen on knowing how they are regarded. They've known  partly because I've encouraged them to realize it  that countries depend enormously on their reputations in order to survive and prosper in the world. If a country has a great  positive image  like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland  everything is easy and everything is cheap. You get more tourists. You get more investors. You sell your products more expensively. If  on the other hand  you have a country with a very weak or a very negative image  everything is difficult and everything is expensive. So governments care desperately about the image of their country  because it makes a direct difference to how much money they can make  and that's what they've promised their populations they're going to deliver. So a couple of years ago  I thought I would take some time out and speak to that gigantic database and ask it  why do some people prefer one country more than another  And the answer that the database gave me completely staggered me. It was  . . I haven't got time to explain in detail. Basically what it told me was   the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries. We don't admire countries primarily because they're rich  because they're powerful  because they're successful  because they're modern  because they're technologically advanced. We primarily admire countries that are good. What do we mean by good  We mean countries that seem to contribute something to the world in which we live  countries that actually make the world safer or better or richer or fairer. Those are the countries we like. This is a discovery of significant importance   you see where I'm going   because it squares the circle. I can now say  and often do  to any government  in order to do well  you need to do good. If you want to sell more products  if you want to get more investment  if you want to become more competitive  then you need to start behaving  because that's why people will respect you and do business with you  and therefore  the more you collaborate  the more competitive you become. This is quite an important discovery  and as soon as I discovered this  I felt another index coming on. I swear that as I get older  my ideas become simpler and more and more childish. This one is called the Good Country Index  and it does exactly what it says on the tin. It measures  or at least it tries to measure  exactly how much each country on Earth contributes not to its own population but to the rest of humanity. Bizarrely  nobody had ever thought of measuring this before. So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent the best part of the last two years  with the help of a large number of very serious and clever people  cramming together all the reliable data in the world we could find about what countries give to the world. And you're waiting for me to tell you which one comes top. And I'm going to tell you  but first of all I want to tell you precisely what I mean when I say a good country. I do not mean morally good. When I say that Country X is the goodest country on Earth  and I mean goodest  I don't mean best. Best is something different. When you're talking about a good country  you can be good  gooder and goodest. It's not the same thing as good  better and best. This is a country which simply gives more to humanity than any other country. I don't talk about how they behave at home because that's measured elsewhere. And the winner is Ireland. According to the data here  no country on Earth  per head of population  per dollar of GDP  contributes more to the world that we live in than Ireland. What does this mean  This means that as we go to sleep at night  all of us in the last    seconds before we drift off to sleep  our final thought should be  godammit  I'm glad that Ireland exists. And that    Applause    In the depths of a very severe economic recession  I think that there's a really important lesson there  that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy  that's really something. Finland ranks pretty much the same. The only reason why it's below Ireland is because its lowest score is lower than Ireland's lowest score. Now the other thing you'll notice about the top    there is  of course  they're all  apart from New Zealand  Western European nations. They're also all rich. This depressed me  because one of the things that I did not want to discover with this index is that it's purely the province of rich countries to help poor countries. This is not what it's all about. And indeed  if you look further down the list  I don't have the slide here  you will see something that made me very happy indeed  that Kenya is in the top     and that demonstrates one very  very important thing. This is not about money. This is about attitude. This is about culture. This is about a government and a people that care about the rest of the world and have the imagination and the courage to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly. I'm going to whip through the other slides just so you can see some of the lower lying countries. There's Germany at   th  the U.S. comes   st  Mexico comes   th  and then we have some of the big developing countries  like Russia at   th  China at    th. Countries like China and Russia and India  which is down in the same part of the index  well  in some ways  it's not surprising. They've spent a great deal of time over the last decades building their own economy  building their own society and their own polity  but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth will be somewhat more outward looking than the first phase has been so far. And then you can break down each country in terms of the actual datasets that build into it. I'll allow you to do that. From midnight tonight it's going to be on goodcountry.org  and you can look at the country. You can look right down to the level of the individual datasets. Now that's the Good Country Index. What's it there for  Well  it's there really because I want to try to introduce this word  or reintroduce this word  into the discourse. I've had enough hearing about competitive countries. I've had enough hearing about prosperous  wealthy  fast growing countries. I've even had enough hearing about happy countries because in the end that's still selfish. That's still about us  and if we carry on thinking about us  we are in deep  deep trouble. I think we all know what it is that we want to hear about. We want to hear about good countries  and so I want to ask you all a favor. I'm not asking a lot. It's something that you might find easy to do and you might even find enjoyable and even helpful to do  and that's simply to start using the word  good  in this context. When you think about your own country  when you think about other people's countries  when you think about companies  when you talk about the world that we live in today  start using that word in the way that I've talked about this evening. Not good  the opposite of bad  because that's an argument that never finishes. Good  the opposite of selfish  good being a country that thinks about all of us. That's what I would like you to do  and I'd like you to use it as a stick with which to beat your politicians. When you elect them  when you reelect them  when you vote for them  when you listen to what they're offering you  use that word   good   and ask yourself   Is that what a good country would do   And if the answer is no  be very suspicious. Ask yourself  is that the behavior of my country  Do I want to come from a country where the government  in my name  is doing things like that  Or do I  on the other hand  prefer the idea of walking around the world with my head held high thinking   Yeah  I'm proud to come from a good country   And everybody will welcome you. And everybody in the last    seconds before they drift off to sleep at night will say   Gosh  I'm glad that person's country exists.  Ultimately  that  I think  is what will make the change. That word   good   and the number  .  and the discovery that's behind it have changed my life. I think they can change your life  and I think we can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave  and in doing so  we can change the world. I've started thinking very differently about my own country since I've been thinking about these things. I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country  and then I started thinking I wanted to live in a happy country  but I began to realize  it's not enough. I don't want to live in a rich country. I don't want to live in a fast growing or competitive country. I want to live in a good country  and I so  so hope that you do too. Thank you. When we think about prejudice and bias  we tend to think about stupid and evil people doing stupid and evil things. And this idea is nicely summarized by the British critic William Hazlitt  who wrote   Prejudice is the child of ignorance.  I want to try to convince you here that this is mistaken. I want to try to convince you that prejudice and bias are natural  they're often rational  and they're often even moral  and I think that once we understand this  we're in a better position to make sense of them when they go wrong  when they have horrible consequences  and we're in a better position to know what to do when this happens. So  start with stereotypes. You look at me  you know my name  you know certain facts about me  and you could make certain judgments. You could make guesses about my ethnicity  my political affiliation  my religious beliefs. And the thing is  these judgments tend to be accurate. We're very good at this sort of thing. And we're very good at this sort of thing because our ability to stereotype people is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind  but rather it's a specific instance of a more general process  which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that fall into categories  and we can use our experience to make generalizations about novel instances of these categories. So everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs  and based on this  you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess  you could sit on the chair  you could eat the apple  the dog will bark. Now we might be wrong. The chair could collapse if you sit on it  the apple might be poison  the dog might not bark  and in fact  this is my dog Tessie  who doesn't bark. But for the most part  we're good at this. For the most part  we make good guesses both in the social domain and the non social domain  and if we weren't able to do so  if we weren't able to make guesses about new instances that we encounter  we wouldn't survive. And in fact  Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay concedes this. He writes   Without the aid of prejudice and custom  I should not be able to find my way my across the room  nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances  nor what to feel in any relation of life.  Or take bias. Now sometimes  we break the world up into us versus them  into in group versus out group  and sometimes when we do this  we know we're doing something wrong  and we're kind of ashamed of it. But other times we're proud of it. We openly acknowledge it. And my favorite example of this is a question that came from the audience in a Republican debate prior to the last election. the question in the hall  on foreign aid  Yes  ma'am. Woman  The American people are suffering in our country right now. Why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves  AC  Governor Perry  what about that  Rick Perry  Absolutely  I think it's  Paul Bloom  Each of the people onstage agreed with the premise of her question  which is as Americans  we should care more about Americans than about other people. And in fact  in general  people are often swayed by feelings of solidarity  loyalty  pride  patriotism  towards their country or towards their ethnic group. Regardless of your politics  many people feel proud to be American  and they favor Americans over other countries. Residents of other countries feel the same about their nation  and we feel the same about our ethnicities. Now some of you may reject this. Some of you may be so cosmopolitan that you think that ethnicity and nationality should hold no moral sway. But even you sophisticates accept that there should be some pull towards the in group in the domain of friends and family  of people you're close to  and so even you make a distinction between us versus them. Now  this distinction is natural enough and often moral enough  but it can go awry  and this was part of the research of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel. Tajfel was born in Poland in     . He left to go to university in France  because as a Jew  he couldn't go to university in Poland  and then he enlisted in the French military in World War II. He was captured and ended up in a prisoner of war camp  and it was a terrifying time for him  because if it was discovered that he was a Jew  he could have been moved to a concentration camp  where he most likely would not have survived. And in fact  when the war ended and he was released  most of his friends and family were dead. He got involved in different pursuits. He helped out the war orphans. But he had a long lasting interest in the science of prejudice  and so when a prestigious British scholarship on stereotypes opened up  he applied for it  and he won it  and then he began this amazing career. And what started his career is an insight that the way most people were thinking about the Holocaust was wrong. Many people  most people at the time  viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans  some genetic taint  some authoritarian personality. And Tajfel rejected this. Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust is just an exaggeration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us. And to explore this  he did a series of classic studies with British adolescents. And in one of his studies  what he did was he asked the British adolescents all sorts of questions  and then based on their answers  he said   I've looked at your answers  and based on the answers  I have determined that you are either    he told half of them    a Kandinsky lover  you love the work of Kandinsky  or a Klee lover  you love the work of Klee.  It was entirely bogus. Their answers had nothing to do with Kandinsky or Klee. They probably hadn't heard of the artists. He just arbitrarily divided them up. But what he found was  these categories mattered  so when he later gave the subjects money  they would prefer to give the money to members of their own group than members of the other group. Worse  they were actually most interested in establishing a difference between their group and other groups  so they would give up money for their own group if by doing so they could give the other group even less. This bias seems to show up very early. So my colleague and wife  Karen Wynn  at Yale has done a series of studies with babies where she exposes babies to puppets  and the puppets have certain food preferences. So one of the puppets might like green beans. The other puppet might like graham crackers. They test the babies own food preferences  and babies typically prefer the graham crackers. But the question is  does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets  And it matters a lot. They tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes that they have  and worse  they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste. We see this sort of in group  out group psychology all the time. We see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies. We see it in its extreme in cases of war  where the out group isn't merely given less  but dehumanized  as in the Nazi perspective of Jews as vermin or lice  or the American perspective of Japanese as rats. Stereotypes can also go awry. So often they're rational and useful  but sometimes they're irrational  they give the wrong answers  and other times they lead to plainly immoral consequences. And the case that's been most studied is the case of race. There was a fascinating study prior to the      election where social psychologists looked at the extent to which the candidates were associated with America  as in an unconscious association with the American flag. And in one of their studies they compared Obama and McCain  and they found McCain is thought of as more American than Obama  and to some extent  people aren't  that surprised by hearing that. McCain is a celebrated war hero  and many people would explicitly say he has more of an American story than Obama. But they also compared Obama to British Prime Minister Tony Blair  and they found that Blair was also thought of as more American than Obama  even though subjects explicitly understood that he's not American at all. But they were responding  of course  to the color of his skin. These stereotypes and biases have real world consequences  both subtle and very important. In one recent study  researchers put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards. Some of them were held by white hands  others by black hands. They were the same baseball cards. The ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bids than the ones held by white hands. In research done at Stanford  psychologists explored the case of people sentenced for the murder of a white person. It turns out  holding everything else constant  you are considerably more likely to be executed if you look like the man on the right than the man on the left  and this is in large part because the man on the right looks more prototypically black  more prototypically African American  and this apparently influences people's decisions over what to do about him. So now that we know about this  how do we combat it  And there are different avenues. One avenue is to appeal to people's emotional responses  to appeal to people's empathy  and we often do that through stories. So if you are a liberal parent and you want to encourage your children to believe in the merits of nontraditional families  you might give them a book like this.   Heather Has Two Mommies   If you are conservative and have a different attitude  you might give them a book like this. But in general  stories can turn anonymous strangers into people who matter  and the idea that we care about people when we focus on them as individuals is an idea which has shown up across history. So Stalin apocryphally said   A single death is a tragedy  a million deaths is a statistic   and Mother Teresa said   If I look at the mass  I will never act. If I look at the one  I will.  Psychologists have explored this. For instance  in one study  people were given a list of facts about a crisis  and it was seen how much they would donate to solve this crisis  and another group was given no facts at all but they were told of an individual and given a name and given a face  and it turns out that they gave far more. None of this I think is a secret to the people who are engaged in charity work. People don't tend to deluge people with facts and statistics. Rather  you show them faces  you show them people. It's possible that by extending our sympathies to an individual  they can spread to the group that the individual belongs to. This is Harriet Beecher Stowe. The story  perhaps apocryphal  is that President Lincoln invited her to the White House in the middle of the Civil War and said to her   So you're the little lady who started this great war.  And he was talking about  Uncle Tom's Cabin.   Uncle Tom's Cabin  is not a great book of philosophy or of theology or perhaps not even literature  but it does a great job of getting people to put themselves in the shoes of people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of  put themselves in the shoes of slaves. And that could well have been a catalyst for great social change. More recently  looking at America in the last several decades  there's some reason to believe that shows like  The Cosby Show  radically changed American attitudes towards African Americans  while shows like  Will and Grace  and  Modern Family  changed American attitudes towards gay men and women. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the major catalyst in America for moral change has been a situation comedy. But it's not all emotions  and I want to end by appealing to the power of reason. At some point in his wonderful book  The Better Angels of Our Nature   Steven Pinker says  the Old Testament says love thy neighbor  and the New Testament says love thy enemy  but I don't love either one of them  not really  but I don't want to kill them. I know I have obligations to them  but my moral feelings to them  my moral beliefs about how I should behave towards them  aren't grounded in love. What they're grounded in is the understanding of human rights  a belief that their life is as valuable to them as my life is to me  and to support this  he tells a story by the great philosopher Adam Smith  and I want to tell this story too  though I'm going to modify it a little bit for modern times. So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine the death of thousands of people  and imagine that the thousands of people are in a country you are not familiar with. It could be China or India or a country in Africa. And Smith says  how would you respond  And you would say  well that's too bad  and you'd go on to the rest of your life. If you were to open up The New York Times online or something  and discover this  and in fact this happens to us all the time  we go about our lives. But imagine instead  Smith says  you were to learn that tomorrow you were to have your little finger chopped off. Smith says  that would matter a lot. You would not sleep that night wondering about that. So this raises the question  Would you sacrifice thousands of lives to save your little finger  Now answer this in the privacy of your own head  but Smith says  absolutely not  what a horrid thought. And so this raises the question  and so  as Smith puts it   When our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish  how comes it that our active principles should often be so generous and so noble   And Smith's answer is   It is reason  principle  conscience.  This  calls to us  with a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions  that we are but one of the multitude  in no respect better than any other in it.  And this last part is what is often described as the principle of impartiality. And this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world's religions  in all of the different versions of the golden rule  and in all of the world's moral philosophies  which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial point of view. The best articulation of this view is actually  for me  it's not from a theologian or from a philosopher  but from Humphrey Bogart at the end of  Casablanca.  So  spoiler alert  he's telling his lover that they have to separate for the more general good  and he says to her  and I won't do the accent  but he says to her   It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.  Our reason could cause us to override our passions. Our reason could motivate us to extend our empathy  could motivate us to write a book like  Uncle Tom's Cabin   or read a book like  Uncle Tom's Cabin   and our reason can motivate us to create customs and taboos and laws that will constrain us from acting upon our impulses when  as rational beings  we feel we should be constrained. This is what a constitution is. A constitution is something which was set up in the past that applies now in the present  and what it says is  no matter how much we might to reelect a popular president for a third term  no matter how much white Americans might choose to feel that they want to reinstate the institution of slavery  we can't. We have bound ourselves. And we bind ourselves in other ways as well. We know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job  for an award  we are strongly biased by their race  we are biased by their gender  we are biased by how attractive they are  and sometimes we might say   Well fine  that's the way it should be.  But other times we say   This is wrong.  And so to combat this  we don't just try harder  but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can't bias us  which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens  so the only information they have is the information they believe should matter. I think prejudice and bias illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature. We have gut feelings  instincts  emotions  and they affect our judgments and our actions for good and for evil  but we are also capable of rational deliberation and intelligent planning  and we can use these to  in some cases  accelerate and nourish our emotions  and in other cases staunch them. And it's in this way that reason helps us create a better world. Thank you. I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise. I soared through the galaxy driving a huge starship with a crew made up of people from all over this world  many different races  many different cultures  many different heritages  all working together  and our mission was to explore strange new worlds  to seek out new life and new civilizations  to boldly go where no one has gone before. Well   I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America  boldly going to a strange new world  seeking new opportunities. My mother was born in Sacramento  California. My father was a San Franciscan. They met and married in Los Angeles  and I was born there. I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December         by Japan  and overnight  the world was plunged into a world war. America suddenly was swept up by hysteria. Japanese Americans  American citizens of Japanese ancestry  were looked on with suspicion and fear and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor. And the hysteria grew and grew until in February       the president of the United States  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  ordered all Japanese Americans on the West Coast of America to be summarily rounded up with no charges  with no trial  with no due process. Due process  this is a core pillar of our justice system. That all disappeared. We were to be rounded up and imprisoned in    barbed wire prison camps in some of the most desolate places in America  the blistering hot desert of Arizona  the sultry swamps of Arkansas  the wastelands of Wyoming  Idaho  Utah  Colorado  and two of the most desolate places in California. On April   th  I celebrated my fifth birthday  and just a few weeks after my birthday  my parents got my younger brother  my baby sister and me up very early one morning  and they dressed us hurriedly. My brother and I were in the living room looking out the front window  and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway. They carried bayonets on their rifles. They stomped up the front porch and banged on the door. My father answered it  and the soldiers ordered us out of our home. My father gave my brother and me small luggages to carry  and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out  and when my mother finally came out  she had our baby sister in one arm  a huge duffel bag in the other  and tears were streaming down both her cheeks. I will never be able to forget that scene. It is burned into my memory. We were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other Japanese American families. There were guards stationed at both ends of each car  as if we were criminals. We were taken two thirds of the way across the country  rocking on that train for four days and three nights  to the swamps of Arkansas. I still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me. I remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us. I remember the searchlight that followed me when I made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine. But to five year old me  I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way for me to pee. I was a child  too young to understand the circumstances of my being there. Children are amazingly adaptable. What would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps. It became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall. It became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower. Being in a prison  a barbed wire prison camp  became my normality. When the war ended  we were released  and given a one way ticket to anywhere in the United States. My parents decided to go back home to Los Angeles  but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place. We were penniless. Everything had been taken from us  and the hostility was intense. Our first home was on Skid Row in the lowest part of our city  living with derelicts  drunkards and crazy people  the stench of urine all over  on the street  in the alley  in the hallway. It was a horrible experience  and for us kids  it was terrorizing. I remember once a drunkard came staggering down  fell down right in front of us  and threw up. My baby sister said   Mama  let's go back home   because behind barbed wires was for us home. My parents worked hard to get back on their feet. We had lost everything. They were at the middle of their lives and starting all over. They worked their fingers to the bone  and ultimately they were able to get the capital together to buy a three bedroom home in a nice neighborhood. And I was a teenager  and I became very curious about my childhood imprisonment. I had read civics books that told me about the ideals of American democracy. All men are created equal  we have an inalienable right to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  and I couldn't quite make that fit with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment. I read history books  and I couldn't find anything about it. And so I engaged my father after dinner in long  sometimes heated conversations. We had many  many conversations like that  and what I got from them was my father's wisdom. He was the one that suffered the most under those conditions of imprisonment  and yet he understood American democracy. He told me that our democracy is a people's democracy  and it can be as great as the people can be  but it is also as fallible as people are. He told me that American democracy is vitally dependent on good people who cherish the ideals of our system and actively engage in the process of making our democracy work. And he took me to a campaign headquarters   the governor of Illinois was running for the presidency   and introduced me to American electoral politics. And he also told me about young Japanese Americans during the Second World War. When Pearl Harbor was bombed  young Japanese Americans  like all young Americans  rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country. That act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face. We were denied service  and categorized as enemy non alien. It was outrageous to be called an enemy when you're volunteering to fight for your country  but that was compounded with the word  non alien   which is a word that means  citizen  in the negative. They even took the word  citizen  away from us  and imprisoned them for a whole year. And then the government realized that there's a wartime manpower shortage  and as suddenly as they'd rounded us up  they opened up the military for service by young Japanese Americans. It was totally irrational  but the amazing thing  the astounding thing  is that thousands of young Japanese American men and women again went from behind those barbed wire fences  put on the same uniform as that of our guards  leaving their families in imprisonment  to fight for this country. They said that they were going to fight not only to get their families out from behind those barbed wire fences  but because they cherished the very ideal of what our government stands for  should stand for  and that was being abrogated by what was being done. All men are created equal. And they went to fight for this country. They were put into a segregated all Japanese American unit and sent to the battlefields of Europe  and they threw themselves into it. They fought with amazing  incredible courage and valor. They were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally. There is one battle that illustrates that. It was a battle for the Gothic Line. The Germans were embedded in this mountain hillside  rocky hillside  in impregnable caves  and three allied battalions had been pounding away at it for six months  and they were stalemated. The    nd was called in to add to the fight  but the men of the    nd came up with a unique but dangerous idea  The backside of the mountain was a sheer rock cliff. The Germans thought an attack from the backside would be impossible. The men of the    nd decided to do the impossible. On a dark  moonless night  they began scaling that rock wall  a drop of more than       feet  in full combat gear. They climbed all night long on that sheer cliff. In the darkness  some lost their handhold or their footing and they fell to their deaths in the ravine below. They all fell silently. Not a single one cried out  so as not to give their position away. The men climbed for eight hours straight  and those who made it to the top stayed there until the first break of light  and as soon as light broke  they attacked. The Germans were surprised  and they took the hill and broke the Gothic Line. A six month stalemate was broken by the    nd in    minutes. It was an amazing act  and when the war ended  the    nd returned to the United States as the most decorated unit of the entire Second World War. They were greeted back on the White House Lawn by President Truman  who said to them   You fought not only the enemy but prejudice  and you won.  They are my heroes. They clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country  and they proved that being an American is not just for some people  that race is not how we define being an American. They expanded what it means to be an American  including Japanese Americans that were feared and suspected and hated. They were change agents  and they left for me a legacy. They are my heroes and my father is my hero  who understood democracy and guided me through it. They gave me a legacy  and with that legacy comes a responsibility  and I am dedicated to making my country an even better America  to making our government an even truer democracy  and because of the heroes that I have and the struggles that we've gone through  I can stand before you as a gay Japanese American  but even more than that  I am a proud American. Thank you very much. On March           I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab meeting with faculty  students and staff  and we were trying to figure out whether I should be the next director. That night  at midnight  a magnitude   earthquake hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan. My wife and family were in Japan  and as the news started to come in  I was panicking. I was looking at the news streams and listening to the press conferences of the government officials and the Tokyo Power Company  and hearing about this explosion at the nuclear reactors and this cloud of fallout that was headed towards our house which was only about     kilometers away. And the people on TV weren't telling us anything that we wanted to hear. I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor  what was going on with the radiation  whether my family was in danger. So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing  which was to go onto the Internet and try to figure out if I could take matters into my own hands. On the Net  I found there were a lot of other people like me trying to figure out what was going on  and together we sort of loosely formed a group and we called it Safecast  and we decided we were going to try to measure the radiation and get the data out to everybody else  because it was clear that the government wasn't going to be doing this for us. Three years later  we have    million data points  we have designed our own Geiger counters that you can download the designs and plug it into the network. We have an app that shows you most of the radiation in Japan and other parts of the world. We are arguably one of the most successful citizen science projects in the world  and we have created the largest open dataset of radiation measurements. And the interesting thing here is how did    Applause    Thank you. How did a bunch of amateurs who really didn't know what we were doing somehow come together and do what NGOs and the government were completely incapable of doing  And I would suggest that this has something to do with the Internet. It's not a fluke. It wasn't luck  and it wasn't because it was us. It helped that it was an event that pulled everybody together  but it was a new way of doing things that was enabled by the Internet and a lot of the other things that were going on  and I want to talk a little bit about what those new principles are. So remember before the Internet   Laughter  I call this B.I. Okay  So  in B.I.  life was simple. Things were Euclidian  Newtonian  somewhat predictable. People actually tried to predict the future  even the economists. And then the Internet happened  and the world became extremely complex  extremely low cost  extremely fast  and those Newtonian laws that we so dearly cherished turned out to be just local ordinances  and what we found was that in this completely unpredictable world that most of the people who were surviving were working with sort of a different set of principles  and I want to talk a little bit about that. Before the Internet  if you remember  when we tried to create services  what you would do is you'd create the hardware layer and the network layer and the software and it would cost millions of dollars to do anything that was substantial. So when it costs millions of dollars to do something substantial  what you would do is you'd get an MBA who would write a plan and get the money from V.C.s or big companies  and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers  and they'd build the thing. This is the Before Internet  B.I.  innovation model. What happened after the Internet was the cost of innovation went down so much because the cost of collaboration  the cost of distribution  the cost of communication  and Moore's Law made it so that the cost of trying a new thing became nearly zero  and so you would have Google  Facebook  Yahoo  students that didn't have permission   permissionless innovation   didn't have permission  didn't have PowerPoints  they just built the thing  then they raised the money  and then they sort of figured out a business plan and maybe later on they hired some MBAs. So the Internet caused innovation  at least in software and services  to go from an MBA driven innovation model to a designer engineer driven innovation model  and it pushed innovation to the edges  to the dorm rooms  to the startups  away from the large institutions  the stodgy old institutions that had the power and the money and the authority. And we all know this. We all know this happened on the Internet. It turns out it's happening in other things  too. Let me give you some examples. So at the Media Lab  we don't just do hardware. We do all kinds of things. We do biology  we do hardware  and Nicholas Negroponte famously said   Demo or die   as opposed to  Publish or perish   which was the traditional academic way of thinking. And he often said  the demo only has to work once  because the primary mode of us impacting the world was through large companies being inspired by us and creating products like the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms. But today  with the ability to deploy things into the real world at such low cost  I'm changing the motto now  and this is the official public statement. I'm officially saying   Deploy or die.  You have to get the stuff into the real world for it to really count  and sometimes it will be large companies  and Nicholas can talk about satellites. Thank you. But we should be getting out there ourselves and not depending on large institutions to do it for us. So last year  we sent a bunch of students to Shenzhen  and they sat on the factory floors with the innovators in Shenzhen  and it was amazing. What was happening there was you would have these manufacturing devices  and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints. They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment and innovating right on the manufacturing equipment. The factory was in the designer  and the designer was literally in the factory. And so what you would do is  you'd go down to the stalls and you would see these cell phones. So instead of starting little websites like the kids in Palo Alto do  the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones. They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto make websites  and so there's a rainforest of innovation going on in the cell phone. What they do is  they make a cell phone  go down to the stall  they sell some  they look at the other kids' stuff  go up  make a couple thousand more  go down. Doesn't this sound like a software thing  It sounds like agile software development  A B testing and iteration  and what we thought you could only do with software kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware. My next fellow  I hope  is going to be one of these innovators from Shenzhen. And so what you see is that is pushing innovation to the edges. We talk about  D printers and stuff like that  and that's great  but this is Limor. She is one of our favorite graduates  and she is standing in front of a Samsung Techwin Pick and Place Machine. This thing can put        components per hour onto an electronics board. This is a factory in a box. So what used to take a factory full of workers working by hand in this little box in New York  she's able to have effectively   She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen to do this manufacturing. She can buy this box and she can manufacture it. So manufacturing  the cost of innovation  the cost of prototyping  distribution  manufacturing  hardware  is getting so low that innovation is being pushed to the edges and students and startups are being able to build it. This is a recent thing  but this will happen and this will change just like it did with software. Sorona is a DuPont process that uses a genetically engineered microbe to turn corn sugar into polyester. It's    percent more efficient than the fossil fuel method  and it's much better for the environment. Genetic engineering and bioengineering are creating a whole bunch of great new opportunities for chemistry  for computation  for memory. We will probably be doing a lot  obviously doing health things  but we will probably be growing chairs and buildings soon. The problem is  Sorona costs about     million dollars and took seven years to build. It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days. The thing is  the cost of innovation in bioengineering is also going down. This is desktop gene sequencer. It used to cost millions and millions of dollars to sequence genes. Now you can do it on a desktop like this  and kids can do this in dorm rooms. This is Gen  gene assembler  and so right now when you try to print a gene  what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand  you have one error per     base pairs  and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money. This new device assembles genes on a chip  and instead of one error per     base pairs  it's one error per        base pairs. In this lab  we will have the world's capacity of gene printing within a year      million base pairs a year. This is kind of like when we went from transistor radios wrapped by hand to the Pentium. This is going to become the Pentium of bioengineering  pushing bioengineering into the hands of dorm rooms and startup companies. So it's happening in software and in hardware and bioengineering  and so this is a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation. It's a bottom up innovation  it's democratic  it's chaotic  it's hard to control. It's not bad  but it's very different  and I think that the traditional rules that we have for institutions don't work anymore  and most of us here operate with a different set of principles. One of my favorite principles is the power of pull  which is the idea of pulling resources from the network as you need them rather than stocking them in the center and controlling everything. So in the case of the Safecast story  I didn't know anything when the earthquake happened  but I was able to find Sean who was the hackerspace community organizer  and Peter  the analog hardware hacker who made our first Geiger counter  and Dan  who built the Three Mile Island monitoring system after the Three Mile Island meltdown. And these people I wouldn't have been able to find beforehand and probably were better that I found them just in time from the network. I'm a three time college dropout  so learning over education is very near and dear to my heart  but to me  education is what people do to you and learning is what you do to yourself. And it feels like  and I'm biased  it feels like they're trying to make you memorize the whole encyclopedia before they let you go out and play  and to me  I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone  and it feels like they assume you're going to be on top of some mountain all by yourself with a number   pencil trying to figure out what to do when in fact you're always going to be connected  you're always going to have friends  and you can pull Wikipedia up whenever you need it  and what you need to learn is how to learn. In the case of Safecast  a bunch of amateurs when we started three years ago  I would argue that we probably as a group know more than any other organization about how to collect data and publish data and do citizen science. Compass over maps. So this one  the idea is that the cost of writing a plan or mapping something is getting so expensive and it's not very accurate or useful. So in the Safecast story  we knew we needed to collect data  we knew we wanted to publish the data  and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan  we first said  oh  let's get Geiger counters. Oh  they've run out. Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors. Okay  then we can make a mobile Geiger counter. We can drive around. We can get volunteers. We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it. We could not have planned this whole thing  but by having a very strong compass  we eventually got to where we were going  and to me it's very similar to agile software development  but this idea of compasses is very important. So I think the good news is that even though the world is extremely complex  what you need to do is very simple. I think it's about stopping this notion that you need to plan everything  you need to stock everything  and you need to be so prepared  and focus on being connected  always learning  fully aware  and super present. So I don't like the word  futurist.  I think we should be now ists  like we are right now. Thank you. which is in play mode  I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together. We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future. Very interested in touch sensitive displays  high tech  high touch  not having to pick up your fingers to use them. There is another way where computers touch people  wearing  physically wearing. Suddenly on September   th  the world got bigger. NN  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. When I was asked to do this  I was also asked to look at all    TED Talks that I had given  chronologically. The first one was actually two hours. The second one was an hour  and then they became half hours  and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger. Imagine seeing your life     years of it  go by  and it was  to say the least  for me  quite a shocking experience. So what I'm going to do in my time is try and share with you what happened during the    years  and then also make a prediction  and then tell you a little bit about what I'm doing next. And I put on a slide where TED   happened in my life. And it's rather important because I had done    years of research before it  so I had a backlog  so it was easy. It's not that I was Fidel Castro and I could talk for two hours  or Bucky Fuller. I had    years of stuff  and the Media Lab was about to start. So that was easy. But there are a couple of things about that period and about what happened that are really quite important. One is that it was a period when computers weren't yet for people. And the other thing that sort of happened during that time is that we were considered sissy computer scientists. We weren't considered the real thing. So what I'm going to show you is  in retrospect  a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time. So I'm going to characterize the years and I'm even going to go back to some very early work of mine  and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '  s  very direct manipulation  very influenced as I studied architecture by the architect Moshe Safdie  and you can see that we even built robotic things that could build habitat like structures. And this for me was not yet the Media Lab  but was the beginning of what I'll call sensory computing  and I pick fingers partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous. Papers were published about how stupid it was to use fingers. Three reasons  One was they were low resolution. The other is your hand would occlude what you wanted to see  and the third  which was the winner  was that your fingers would get the screen dirty  and hence  fingers would never be a device that you'd use. And this was a device we built in the '  s  which has never even been picked up. It's not just touch sensitive  it's pressure sensitive. NN  Later work  and again this was before TED     Create a large green circle there. Man  Aw  shit. NN    was to sort of do interface concurrently  so when you talked and you pointed and you had  if you will  multiple channels. Entebbe happened.       Air France was hijacked  taken to Entebbe  and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue  they did it partly because they had practiced on a physical model of the airport  because they had built the airport  so they built a model in the desert  and when they arrived at Entebbe  they knew where to go because they had actually been there. The U.S. government asked some of us  '    if we could replicate that computationally  and of course somebody like myself says yes. Immediately  you get a contract  Department of Defense  and we built this truck and this rig. We did sort of a simulation  because you had video discs  and again  this is '  . And then many years later  you get this truck  and so you have Google Maps. Still people thought  no  that was not serious computer science  and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner  who happened to be the president of MIT  who did think it was computer science. And one of the keys for anybody who wants to start something in life  Make sure your president is part of it. So when I was doing the Media Lab  it was like having a gorilla in the front seat. If you were stopped for speeding and the officer looked in the window and saw who was in the passenger seat  then   Oh  continue on  sir.  And so we were able  and this is a cute  actually  device  parenthetically. This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner where the only thing that changed in the photograph were the lips. So when you oscillated that little piece of lenticular sheet with his photograph  it would be in lip sync with zero bandwidth. It was a zero bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time. So this was the Media Lab's   this is what we said we'd do  that the world of computers  publishing  and so on would come together. Again  not generally accepted  but very much part of TED in the early days. And this is really where we were headed. And that created the Media Lab. One of the things about age is that I can tell you with great confidence  I've been to the future. I've been there  actually  many times. And the reason I say that is  how many times in my life have I said   Oh  in    years  this will happen   and then    years comes. And then you say   Oh  in five years  this will happen.  And then five years comes. So I say this a little bit with having felt that I'd been there a number of times  and one of the things that is most quoted that I've ever said is that computing is not about computers  and that didn't quite get enough traction  and then it started to. It started to because people caught on that the medium wasn't the message. And the reason I show this car in actually a rather ugly slide is just again to tell you the kind of story that characterized a little bit of my life. This is a student of mine who had done a Ph.D. called  Backseat Driver.  It was in the early days of GPS  the car knew where it was  and it would give audio instructions to the driver  when to turn right   when to turn left and so on. Turns out  there are a lot of things in those instructions that back in that period were pretty challenging  like what does it mean  take the next right  Well  if you're coming up on a street  the next right's probably the one after  and there are lots of issues  and the student did a wonderful thesis  and the MIT patent office said  Don't patent it. It'll never be accepted. The liabilities are too large. There will be insurance issues. Don't patent it.  So we didn't  but it shows you how people  again  at times  don't really look at what's happening. Some work  and I'll just go through these very quickly  a lot of sensory stuff. You might recognize a young Yo Yo Ma and tracking his body for playing the cello or the hypercello. These fellows literally walked  around like that at the time. It's now a little bit more discreet and more commonplace. And then there are at least three heroes I want to quickly mention. Marvin Minsky  who taught me a lot about common sense  and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper  who was very important to Ricky Wurman and to TED  and in fact  when she got onstage  she said  the first thing she said was   I introduced Ricky to Nicky.  And nobody calls me Nicky and nobody calls Richard Ricky  so nobody knew who she was talking about. And then  of course  Seymour Papert  who is the person who said   You can't think about thinking unless you think about thinking about something.  And that's actually   you can unpack that later. It's a pretty profound statement. I'm showing some slides that were from TED    a little silly as slides  perhaps. Then I felt television really was about displays. Again  now we're past TED    but just around the time of TED    and what I'd like to mention here is  even though you could imagine intelligence in the device  I look today at some of the work being done about the Internet of Things  and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic  because what has happened is people take the oven panel and put it on your cell phone  or the door key onto your cell phone  just taking it and bringing it to you  and in fact that's actually what you don't want. You want to put a chicken in the oven  and the oven says   Aha  it's a chicken   and it cooks the chicken.  Oh  it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas  and he likes it this way and that way.  So the intelligence  instead of being in the device  we have started today to move it back onto the cell phone or closer to the user  not a particularly enlightened view of the Internet of Things. Television  again  television what I said today  that was back in       and the television of tomorrow would look something like that. Again  people  but they laughed cynically  they didn't laugh with much appreciation. Telecommunications in the     s  George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram the Negroponte switch. I'm probably much less famous than George  so when he called it the Negroponte switch  it stuck  but the idea of things that came in the ground would go in the air and stuff in the air would go into the ground has played itself out. That is the original slide from that year  and it has worked in lockstep obedience. We started Wired magazine. Some people  I remember we shared the reception desk periodically  and some parent called up irate that his son had given up Sports Illustrated to subscribe for Wired  and he said   Are you some porno magazine or something   and couldn't understand why his son would be interested in Wired  at any rate. I will go through this a little quicker. This is my favorite        back page of Newsweek magazine. Okay. Read it.  Laughter    Nicholas Negroponte  director of the MIT Media Lab  predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh  sure.   Clifford Stoll  Newsweek        You must admit that gives you  at least it gives me pleasure when somebody says how dead wrong you are.  Being Digital  came out. For me  it gave me an opportunity to be more in the trade press and get this out to the public  and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab  which if you haven't been to  visit  because it's a beautiful piece of architecture aside from being a wonderful place to work. So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.  Today  multimedia is a desktop or living room experience  because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small  bright  thin  high resolution displays.         We came to them. I looked forward to it every year. It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had in the sense that he invited many of his old friends  including myself. And then something for me changed pretty profoundly. I became more involved with computers and learning and influenced by Seymour  but particularly looking at learning as something that is best approximated by computer programming. When you write a computer program  you've got to not just list things out and sort of take an algorithm and translate it into a set of instructions  but when there's a bug  and all programs have bugs  you've got to de bug it. You've got to go in  change it  and then re execute  and you iterate  and that iteration is really a very  very good approximation of learning. So that led to my own work with Seymour in places like Cambodia and the starting of One Laptop per Child. Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child  so I'll go through it very fast  but it did give us the chance to do something at a relatively large scale in the area of learning  development and computing. Very few people know that One Laptop per Child was a    billion project  and it was  at least over the seven years I ran it  but even more important  the World Bank contributed zero  USAID zero. It was mostly the countries using their own treasuries  which is very interesting  at least to me it was very interesting in terms of what I plan to do next. So these are the various places it happened. I then tried an experiment  and the experiment happened in Ethiopia. And here's the experiment. The experiment is  can learning happen where there are no schools. And we dropped off tablets with no instructions and let the children figure it out. And in a short period of time  they not only turned them on and were using    apps per child within five days  they were singing  ABC  songs within two weeks  but they hacked Android within six months. And so that seemed sufficiently interesting. This is perhaps the best picture I have. The kid on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher. Look at the kid on the left  and so on. There are no adults involved in this at all. So I said  well can we do this at a larger scale  And what is it that's missing  The kids are giving a press conference at this point  and sort of writing in the dirt. And the answer is  what is missing  And I'm going to skip over my prediction  actually  because I'm running out of time  and here's the question  is what's going to happen  I think the challenge is to connect the last billion people  and connecting the last billion is very different than connecting the next billion  and the reason it's different is that the next billion are sort of low hanging fruit  but the last billion are rural. Being rural and being poor are very different. Poverty tends to be created by our society  and the people in that community are not poor in the same way at all. They may be primitive  but the way to approach it and to connect them  the history of One Laptop per Child  and the experiment in Ethiopia  lead me to believe that we can in fact do this in a very short period of time. And so my plan  and unfortunately I haven't been able to get my partners at this point to let me announce them  but is to do this with a stationary satellite. There are many reasons that stationary satellites aren't the best things  but there are a lot of reasons why they are  and for two billion dollars  you can connect a lot more than     million people  but the reason I picked two  and I will leave this as my last slide  is two billion dollars is what we were spending in Afghanistan every week. So surely if we can connect Africa and the last billion people for numbers like that  we should be doing it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Stay up there. Stay up there. NN  You're going to give me extra time  CA  No. That was wickedly clever  wickedly clever. You gamed it beautifully. Nicholas  what is your prediction  NN  Thank you for asking. I'll tell you what my prediction is  and my prediction  and this is a prediction  because it'll be    years. I won't be here. But one of the things about learning how to read  we have been doing a lot of consuming of information going through our eyes  and so that may be a very inefficient channel. So my prediction is that we are  going to ingest information You're going to swallow a pill and know English. You're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare. And the way to do it is through the bloodstream. So once it's in your bloodstream  it basically goes through it and gets into the brain  and when it knows that it's in the brain in the different pieces  it deposits it in the right places. So it's ingesting. CA  Have you been hanging out with Ray Kurzweil by any chance  NN  No  but I've been hanging around with Ed Boyden and hanging around with one of the speakers who is here  Hugh Herr  and there are a number of people. This isn't quite as far fetched  so    years from now. CA  We will check it out. We're going to be back and we're going to play this clip    years from now  and then all eat the red pill. Well thank you for that. Nicholas Negroponte. NN  Thank you. When I was preparing for this talk  I went to search for a couple of quotes that I can share with you. Good news  I found three that I particularly liked  the first by Samuel Johnson  who said   When making your choice in life  do not forget to live   the second by Aeschylus  who reminded us that  happiness is a choice that requires effort   and the third is one by Groucho Marx who said   I wouldn't want to choose to belong to any club that would have me as a member.  Now  bad news  I didn't know which one of these quotes to choose and share with you. The sweet anxiety of choice. In today's times of post industrial capitalism  choice  together with individual freedom and the idea of self making  has been elevated to an ideal. Now  together with this  we also have a belief in endless progress. But the underside of this ideology has been an increase of anxiety  feelings of guilt  feelings of being inadequate  feeling that we are failing in our choices. Sadly  this ideology of individual choice has prevented us from thinking about social changes. It appears that this ideology was actually very efficient in pacifying us as political and social thinkers. Instead of making social critiques  we are more and more engaging in self critique  sometimes to the point of self destruction. Now  how come that ideology of choice is still so powerful  even among people who have not many things to choose among  How come that even people who are poor very much still identify with the idea of choice  the kind of rational idea of choice which we embrace  Now  the ideology of choice is very successful in opening for us a space to think about some imagined future. Let me give you an example. My friend Manya  when she was a student at university in California  was earning money by working for a car dealer. Now  Manya  when she encountered the typical customer  would debate with him about his lifestyle  how much he wants to spend  how many children he has  what does he need the car for  They would usually come to a good conclusion what would be a perfect car. Now  before Manya's customer would go home and think things through  she would say to him   The car that you are buying now is perfect  but in a few year's time  when your kids will be already out of the house  when you will have a little bit more money  that other car will be ideal. But what you are buying now is great.  Now  the majority of Manya's customers who came back the next day bought that other car  the car they did not need  the car that cost far too much money. Now  Manya became so successful in selling cars that soon she moved on to selling airplanes. And knowing so much about the psychology of people prepared her well for her current job  which is that of a psychoanalyst. Now  why were Manya's customers so irrational  Manya's success was that she was able to open in their heads an image of an idealized future  an image of themselves when they are already more successful  freer  and for them  choosing that other car was as if they are coming closer to this ideal in which it was as if Manya already saw them. Now  we rarely make really totally rational choices. Choices are influenced by our unconscious  by our community. We're often choosing by guessing  what would other people think about our choice  Also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing. We're also guessing what is socially acceptable choice. Now  because of this  we actually even after we have already chosen  like bought a car  endlessly read reviews about cars  as if we still want to convince ourselves that we made the right choice. Now  choices are anxiety provoking. They are linked to risks  losses. They are highly unpredictable. Now  because of this  people have now more and more problems that they are not choosing anything. Not long ago  I was at a wedding reception  and I met a young  beautiful woman who immediately started telling me about her anxiety over choice. She said to me   I needed one month to decide which dress to wear.  Then she said   For weeks I was researching which hotel to stay for this one night. And now  I need to choose a sperm donor.  I looked at this woman in shock.  Sperm donor  What's the rush   She said   I'm turning    at the end of this year  and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life.  Now choice  because it's linked to risk  is anxiety provoking  and it was already the famous Danish philosopher S ren Kierkegaard who pointed out that anxiety is linked to the possibility of possibility. Now  we think today that we can prevent these risks. We have endless market analysis  projections of the future earnings. Even with market  which is about chance  randomness  we think we can predict rationally where it's going. Now  chance is actually becoming very traumatic. Last year  my friend Bernard Harcourt at the University of Chicago organized an event  a conference on the idea of chance. He and I were together on the panel  and just before delivering our papers   we didn't know each other's papers   we decided to take chance seriously. So we informed our audience that what they will just now hear will be a random paper  a mixture of the two papers which we didn't know what each was writing. Now  we delivered the conference in such a way. Bernard read his first paragraph  I read my first paragraph  Bernard read his second paragraph  I read my second paragraph  in this way towards the end of our papers. Now  you will be surprised that a majority of our audience did not think that what they'd just listened to was a completely random paper. They couldn't believe that speaking from the position of authority like two professors we were  we would take chance seriously. They thought we prepared the papers together and were just joking that it's random. Now  we live in times with a lot of information  big data  a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies. We decoded our genome. We know about our brains more than before. But surprisingly  people are more and more turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge. Ignorance and denial are on the rise. Now  in regard to the current economic crisis  we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before  and no political or social changes are needed. In regard to ecological crisis  we think nothing needs to be done just now  or others need to act before us. Or even when ecological crisis already happens  like a catastrophe in Fukushima  often we have people living in the same environment with the same amount of information  and half of them will be anxious about radiation and half of them will ignore it. Now  psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don't have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance. Now  what does that mean  Let's say when we are facing a life threatening illness  a lot of people don't want to know that. They'd rather prefer denying the illness  which is why it's not so wise to inform them if they don't ask. Surprisingly  research shows that sometimes people who deny their illness live longer than those who are rationally choosing the best treatment. Now  this ignorance  however  is not very helpful on the level of the social. When we are ignorant about where we are heading  a lot of social damage can be caused. Now  on top of facing ignorance  we are also facing today some kind of an obviousness. Now  it was French philosopher Louis Althusser who pointed out that ideology functions in such a way that it creates a veil of obviousness. Before we do any social critique  it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness and to think through a little bit differently. If we go back to this ideology of individual  rational choice we often embrace  it's necessary precisely here to lift this obviousness and to think a little bit differently. Now for me  a question often is why we still embrace this idea of a self made man on which capitalism relied from its beginning  Why do we think that we are really such masters of our lives that we can rationally make the best ideal choices  that we don't accept losses and risks  And for me  it's very shocking to see sometimes very poor people  for example  not supporting the idea of the rich being taxed more. Quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality. Okay  maybe they don't think that they will make it in the future  but maybe they think  my son might become the next Bill Gates. And who would want to tax one's son  Or  a question for me is also  why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare  Sometimes they don't embrace it  again identifying with the idea of choice  but they have nothing to choose from. Now  Margaret Thatcher famously said that there is nothing like a society. Society doesn't exist  it is only individuals and their families. Sadly  this ideology still functions very well  which is why people who are poor might feel ashamed for their poverty. We might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices  and that's why we didn't succeed. We are anxious that we are not good enough. That's why we work very hard  long hours at the workplace and equally long hours on remaking ourselves. Now  when we are anxious over choices  sometimes we easily give our power of choice away. We identify with the guru who tells us what to do  self help therapist  or we embrace a totalitarian leader who appears to have no doubts about choices  who sort of knows. Now  often people ask me   What did you learn by studying choice   And there is an important message that I did learn. When thinking about choices  I stopped taking choices too seriously  personally. First  I realized a lot of choice I make is not rational. It's linked to my unconscious  my guesses of what others are choosing  or what is a socially embraced choice. I also embrace the idea that we should go beyond thinking about individual choices  that it's very important to rethink social choices  since this ideology of individual choice has pacified us. It really prevented us to think about social change. We spend so much time choosing things for ourselves and barely reflect on communal choices we can make. Now  we should not forget that choice is always linked to change. We can make individual changes  but we can make social changes. We can choose to have more wolves. We can choose to change our environment to have more bees. We can choose to have different rating agencies. We can choose to control corporations instead of allowing corporations to control us. We have a possibility to make changes. Now  I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson  who said that when we make choice in life  we shouldn't forget to live. Finally  you can see I did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which I wanted to start my lecture. I did have a choice  such as nations  as people  we have choices too to rethink in what kind of society we want to live in the future. Thank you. Could I protect my father from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife  That was the question I faced one Tuesday morning in June of       when I was a law student. I woke up early that morning in Dad's apartment on the outskirts of Algiers  Algeria  to an unrelenting pounding on the front door. It was a season as described by a local paper when every Tuesday a scholar fell to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins. My father's university teaching of Darwin had already provoked a classroom visit from the head of the so called Islamic Salvation Front  who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism before Dad had ejected the man  and now whoever was outside would neither identify himself nor go away. So my father tried to get the police on the phone  but perhaps terrified by the rising tide of armed extremism that had already claimed the lives of so many Algerian officers  they didn't even answer. And that was when I went to the kitchen  got out a paring knife  and took up a position inside the entryway. It was a ridiculous thing to do  really  but I couldn't think of anything else  and so there I stood. When I look back now  I think that that was the moment that set me on the path was to writing a book called  Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here  Untold Stories from the Fight Against Muslim Fundamentalism.  The title comes from a Pakistani play. I think it was actually that moment that sent me on the journey to interview     people of Muslim heritage from nearly    countries  from Afghanistan to Mali  to find out how they fought fundamentalism peacefully like my father did  and how they coped with the attendant risks. Luckily  back in June of       our unidentified visitor went away  but other families were so much less lucky  and that was the thought that motivated my research. In any case  someone would return a few months later and leave a note on Dad's kitchen table  which simply said   Consider yourself dead.  Subsequently  Algeria's fundamentalist armed groups would murder as many as         civilians in what came to be known as the dark decade of the     s  including every single one of the women that you see here. In its harsh counterterrorist response  the state resorted to torture and to forced disappearances  and as terrible as all of these events became  the international community largely ignored them. Finally  my father  an Algerian peasant's son turned professor  was forced to stop teaching at the university and to flee his apartment  but what I will never forget about Mahfoud Bennoune  my dad  was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals  he refused to leave the country and he continued to publish pointed criticisms  both of the fundamentalists and sometimes of the government they battled. For example  in a November      series in the newspaper El Watan entitled  How Fundamentalism Produced a Terrorism without Precedent   he denounced what he called the terrorists' radical break with the true Islam as it was lived by our ancestors. These were words that could get you killed. My father's country taught me in that dark decade of the     s that the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism is one of the most important and overlooked human rights struggles in the world. This remains true today  nearly    years later. You see  in every country where you hear about armed jihadis targeting civilians  there are also unarmed people defying those militants that you don't hear about  and those people need our support to succeed. In the West  it's often assumed that Muslims generally condone terrorism. Some on the right think this because they view Muslim culture as inherently violent  and some on the left imagine this because they view Muslim violence  fundamentalist violence  solely as a product of legitimate grievances. But both views are dead wrong. In fact  many people of Muslim heritage around the world are staunch opponents both of fundamentalism and of terrorism  and often for very good reason. You see  they're much more likely to be victims of this violence than its perpetrators. Let me just give you one example. According to a      survey of Arabic language media resources  between      and       no more than    percent of al Qaeda's victims were Westerners. That's a terrible toll  but the vast majority were people of Muslim heritage  killed by Muslim fundamentalists. Now I've been talking for the last five minutes about fundamentalism  and you have a right to know exactly what I mean. I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist Marieme Helie Lucas  and she says that fundamentalisms  note the  s   so within all of the world's great religious traditions   fundamentalisms are political movements of the extreme right which in a context of globalization manipulate religion in order to achieve their political aims.  Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization of theology. Now I want to avoid projecting the notion that there's sort of a monolith out there called Muslim fundamentalism that is the same everywhere  because these movements also have their diversities. Some use and advocate violence. Some do not  though they're often interrelated. They take different forms. Some may be non governmental organizations  even here in Britain like Cageprisoners. Some may become political parties  like the Muslim Brotherhood  and some may be openly armed groups like the Taliban. But in any case  these are all radical projects. They're not conservative or traditional approaches. They're most often about changing people's relationship with Islam rather than preserving it. What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right  and the fact that its adherents are or purport to be Muslim makes them no less offensive than the extreme right anywhere else. So in my view  if we consider ourselves liberal or left wing  human rights loving or feminist  we must oppose these movements and support their grassroots opponents. Now let me be clear that I support an effective struggle against fundamentalism  but also a struggle that must itself respect international law  so nothing I am saying should be taken as a justification for refusals to democratize  and here I send out a shout out of support to the pro democracy movement  in Algeria today  Barakat. Nor should anything I say be taken as a justification of violations of human rights  like the mass death sentences handed out in Egypt earlier this week. But what I am saying is that we must challenge these Muslim fundamentalist movements because they threaten human rights across Muslim majority contexts  and they do this in a range of ways  most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians by the armed groups that carry those out. But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg. These movements as a whole purvey discrimination against religious minorities and sexual minorities. They seek to curtail the freedom of religion of everyone who either practices in a different way or chooses not to practice. And most definingly  they lead an all out war on the rights of women. Now  faced with these movements in recent years  Western discourse has most often offered two flawed responses. The first that one sometimes finds on the right suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist or something about Islam is inherently fundamentalist  and this is just offensive and wrong  but unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters a discourse that is too politically correct to acknowledge the problem of Muslim fundamentalism at all or  even worse  apologizes for it  and this is unacceptable as well. So what I'm seeking is a new way of talking about this all together  which is grounded in the lived experiences and the hope of the people on the front lines. I'm painfully aware that there has been an increase in discrimination against Muslims in recent years in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.  and that too is a matter of grave concern  but I firmly believe that telling these counter stereotypical stories of people of Muslim heritage who have confronted the fundamentalists and been their primary victims is also a great way of countering that discrimination. So now let me introduce you to four people whose stories I had the great honor of telling. Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in Pakistan. With the rise of jihadist violence  they began to receive threats to call off their events  which they refused to heed. And so a bomber struck their      eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore  producing rain of glass that fell into the venue injuring nine people  and later that same night  the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision  they announced that their festival would continue as planned the next day. As Faizan said at the time  if we bow down to the Islamists  we'll just be sitting in a dark corner. But they didn't know what would happen. Would anyone come  In fact  thousands of people came out the next day to support the performing arts in Lahore  and this simultaneously thrilled and terrified Faizan  and he ran up to a woman who had come in with her two small children  and he said   You do know there was a bomb here yesterday  and you do know there's a threat here today.  And she said   I know that  but I came to your festival with my mother when I was their age  and I still have those images in my mind. We have to be here.  With stalwart audiences like this  the Peerzadas were able to conclude their festival on schedule. And then the next year  they lost all of their sponsors due to the security risk. So when I met them in       they were in the middle of the first subsequent event that they were able to have in the same venue  and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival held in Lahore in a year when that city had already experienced    terror attacks. This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban had commenced their systematic targeting of girls' schools that would culminate in the attack on Malala Yousafzai. What did the Peerzadas do in that environment  They staged girls' school theater. So I had the privilege of watching  Naang Wal   which was a musical in the Punjabi language  and the girls of Lahore Grammar School played all the parts. They sang and danced  they played the mice and the water buffalo  and I held my breath  wondering  would we get to the end of this amazing show  And when we did  the whole audience collectively exhaled  and a few people actually wept  and then they filled the auditorium with the peaceful boom of their applause. And I remember thinking in that moment that the bombers made headlines here two years before but this night and these people are as important a story. Maria Bashir is the first and only woman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan. She's been in the post since      and actually opened an office to investigate cases of violence against women  which she says is the most important area in her mandate. When I meet her in her office in Herat  she enters surrounded by four large men with four huge guns. In fact  she now has    bodyguards  because she has weathered bomb attacks that nearly killed her kids  and it took the leg off of one of her guards. Why does she continue  She says with a smile that that is the question that everyone asks  as she puts it   Why you risk not living   And it is simply that for her  a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come is worth the risk  and she knows that if people like her do not take the risk  there will be no better future. Later on in our interview  Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is about the possible outcome of government negotiations with the Taliban  the people who have been trying to kill her.  If we give them a place in the government   she asks   Who will protect women's rights   And she urges the international community not to forget its promise about women because now they want peace with Taliban. A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan  I see a headline on the Internet. An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated. I google desperately  and thankfully that day I find out that Maria was not the victim  though sadly  another Afghan prosecutor was gunned down on his way to work. And when I hear headlines like that now  I think that as international troops leave Afghanistan this year and beyond  we must continue to care about what happens to people there  to all of the Maria Bashirs. Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head saying  with no bravado whatsoever   The situation of the women of Afghanistan will be better someday. We should prepare the ground for this  even if we are killed.  There are no words adequate to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi on the same day as a children's cooking competition in September of     . They killed     including poets and pregnant women. Far away in the American Midwest  I had the good fortune of meeting Somali Americans who were working to counter the efforts of al Shabaab to recruit a small number of young people from their city of Minneapolis to take part in atrocities like Westgate. Abdirizak Bihi's studious    year old nephew Burhan Hassan was recruited here in       spirited to Somalia  and then killed when he tried to come home. Since that time  Mr. Bihi  who directs the no budget Somali Education and Advocacy Center  has been vocally denouncing the recruitment and the failures of government and Somali American institutions like the Abubakar As Saddique Islamic Center where he believes his nephew was radicalized during a youth program. But he doesn't just criticize the mosque. He also takes on the government for its failure to do more to prevent poverty in his community. Given his own lack of financial resources  Mr. Bihi has had to be creative. To counter the efforts of al Shabaab to sway more disaffected youth  in the wake of the group's      attack on World Cup viewers in Uganda  he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament in Minneapolis in response. Scores of Somali American kids came out to embrace sport despite the fatwa against it. They played basketball as Burhan Hassan never would again. For his efforts  Mr. Bihi has been ostracized by the leadership of the Abubakar As Saddique Islamic Center  with which he used to have good relations. He told me   One day we saw the imam on TV calling us infidels and saying  'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'  This is at complete odds with how Abdirizak Bihi understands what he is trying to do by exposing al Shabaab recruitment  which is to save the religion I love from a small number of extremists. Now I want to tell one last story  that of a    year old law student in Algeria named Amel Zenoune Zouani who had the same dreams of a legal career that I did back in the '  s. She refused to give up her studies  despite the fact that the fundamentalists battling the Algerian state back then threatened all who continued their education. On January           Amel boarded the bus in Algiers where she was studying to go home and spend a Ramadan evening with her family  and would never finish law school. When the bus reached the outskirts of her hometown  it was stopped at a checkpoint manned by men from the Armed Islamic Group. Carrying her schoolbag  Amel was taken off the bus and killed in the street. The men who cut her throat then told everyone else   If you go to university  the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this.  Amel died at exactly      p.m.  which we know because when she fell in the street  her watch broke. Her mother showed me the watch with the second hand still aimed optimistically upward towards a      that would never come. Shortly before her death  Amel had said to her mother of herself and her sisters   Nothing will happen to us  Inshallah  God willing  but if something happens  you must know that we are dead for knowledge. You and father must keep your heads held high.  The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable  and so as I did my research I found myself searching for Amel's hope again and her name even means  hope  in Arabic. I think I found it in two places. The first is in the strength of her family and all the other families to continue telling their stories and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism. In fact  Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief  went to law school  and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today  something which is only possible because the armed fundamentalists were largely defeated in the country. And the second place I found Amel's hope was everywhere that women and men continue to defy the jihadis. We must support all of those in honor of Amel who continue this human rights struggle today  like the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws. It is not enough  as the victims rights advocate Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers  it is not enough just to battle terrorism. We must also challenge fundamentalism  because fundamentalism is the ideology that makes the bed of this terrorism. Why is it that people like her  like all of them are not more well known  Why is it that everyone knows who Osama bin Laden was and so few know of all of those standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts. We must change that  and so I ask you to please help share these stories through your networks. Look again at Amel Zenoune's watch  forever frozen  and now please look at your own watch and decide this is the moment that you commit to supporting people like Amel. We don't have the right to be silent about them because it is easier or because Western policy is flawed as well  because      is still coming to too many Amel Zenounes in places like northern Nigeria  where jihadis still kill students. The time to speak up in support of all of those who peacefully challenge fundamentalism and terrorism in their own communities is now. Thank you. Puzzles and magic. I work in what most people think are two distinct fields  but I believe they are the same. I am both a magician and a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor  which basically means I've taken the world's two nerdiest hobbies and combined them into one career. And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives  the urge to solve. Human beings are wired to solve  to make order out of chaos. It's certainly true for me. I've been solving my whole life. High school consisted of epic Scrabble matches in the cafeteria and not really talking to girls  and then at about that time I started learning magic tricks and definitely not talking to girls. There's nothing like starting a conversation with   Hey  did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth    points in Scrabble   But back then  I noticed an intersection between puzzles and illusion. When you do the crossword puzzle or when you watch a magic show  you become a solver  and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos  the chaos of  say  a black and white puzzle grid  a mixed up bag of Scrabble tiles  or a shuffled pack of playing cards. And today  as a cruciverbalist      points   and an illusion designer  I create that chaos. I test your ability to solve. Now  it turns out research tells us that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping. From birth  we are wired to solve. In one UCLA study  newborns still in the hospital were shown patterns  patterns like this  circle  cross  circle  cross. And then the pattern was changed  triangle  square. And by tracking an infant's gaze  we know that newborns as young as a day old can notice and respond to disruptions in order. It's remarkable. So from infancy through old age  the urge to solve unites us all  and I even found this photo on Instagram of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle with her morning coffee. Like. Now  solving exists across all cultures. The American invention is the crossword puzzle  and this year we are celebrating the    th anniversary of the crossword puzzle  first published in The New York World. But many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well. China gives us tangrams  which would test solvers' abilities to form shapes from the jumbled pieces. Chaos. Order. Order. And order. That one's my favorite  let's hear it again. Okay. And how about this puzzle invented in   th century England  the jigsaw puzzle. Is this not making order out of chaos  So as you can see  we are always solving. We are always trying to decode our world. It's an eternal quest. It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about in  Don Quixote   which by the way is the root of the word  quixotry   the highest scoring Scrabble word of all time      points. But anyway   Don Quixote  is an important book. You guys have read  Don Quixote   yes  I'm seeing some heads nod. Come on guys  really  Who's read  Don Quixote   Let's do this. Raise your hands if you've read  Don Quixote.  There we go. Smart audience. Who's read  Don Quixote   Get them up. Okay  good  because I need somebody smart here because now I'm going to demonstrate with the help of one of you just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is  just how wired to solve all of you really are  so I'm going to come into the audience and find somebody to help me. Let's see. Everybody's looking away all of a sudden. Can I  Would you  What is your name  Gwen. I'm not a mind reader  I can see your name tag. Come with me  Gwen. Everyone give her  a round of applause  make her feel welcome. Gwen  after you. Are you so excited  Did you know that your name is worth eight points in Scrabble  Okay  stand right here  Gwen  right here. Now  Gwen  before we begin  I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle  which is here in this envelope  and I will not go near it. Okay  And over here we have a drawing of some farm animals. You can see we have an owl  we have a horse  a donkey  a rooster  an ox  and a sheep  and then here  Gwen  we have some fancy art store markers  colors like  can you see that word right there  Gwen  Cobalt. David Kwong  Cobalt  yes. Cobalt. But we have a silver  a red  an emerald  and an amber marker  and Gwen  you are going to color this drawing just like you were five years old  one marker at a time. It's going to be a lot of fun. But I'm going to go over here. I don't want to see what you're doing. Okay  so don't start yet. Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes. Now Gwen  are you ready  Pick up just one marker  pick up just one marker  and why don't you color in the horse for me  Color in the horse   big  big  big scribbles  broad strokes  don't worry about staying in the lines. All right. Great. And why don't you take that marker and recap it and place it on the table for me. Okay  and pick up another marker out of the cup and take off the cap and color in the donkey for me  color in the donkey. Big scribbles. Okay  cool  and re cap that marker and place it on the table. And pick up another marker for me and take off the cap. Isn't this fun  And color in the owl for me. Color in the owl. Okay  and recap that marker and pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the rooster for me  color in the rooster. Good  good  good  good  good. Big  big  big strokes. Good  good. Pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the ox for me. Color in the ox. Okay  good. A lot of color on that  and recap  and place it on the table  and pick up another marker out of the cup. Oh  I'm out  Okay  I'm going to turn around. Did I forget  Oh  I forgot my purple marker. This is still going to work  though. I think this is still going to work  mostly. So Gwen  I'm going to hand you this envelope. Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet  but I am going to write down your choices so that everybody can see the choices that you made. Okay  great. So we have a cobalt horse  amber owl  a silver ox  yes  okay  a red donkey  and what was the emerald color  A rooster. An emerald rooster. Okay. Now for the moment of truth  Gwen  we're going to take a look in that envelope. Why don't you open it up and remove the one piece of paper from inside and hand it to me  and we will see if it matches your choices. Yes  I think it does. We have a cobalt horse  we have a red donkey  we have an amber owl  we have an emerald rooster  a silver ox  I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep  but that's a pretty amazing coincidence  don't you think  Gwen  well done. That's beautiful.  Applause  I'll take that back from you. So ladies and gentlemen  how is this possible  How is this possible  Well  could it be that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve that she decoded hidden messages  Well this is the puzzle I present to you. Could there be order in the chaos that I created  Let's take a closer look. Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces  What image did it ultimately become  A cobalt horse. The plot thickens. And then we played a game of tangrams with an emerald rooster. That one's my favorite. And then we had an experiment with a silver ox. And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee out of an amber owl. Thank you  Katy  for taking that photo for me. Oh  and there's one more  there's one more. I believe you colored a red donkey  Gwen. Ladies and gentlemen  could you raise your hands for me if you've read  Don Quixote   Who's read  Don Quixote    Laughter  But wait  but wait  wait  wait  wait  there's more. There's more. Gwen  I was so confident that you were going to make these choices that I made another prediction  and I put it in an even more indelible place  and it's right here. Ladies and gentlemen  we have today's New York Times. The date is March   th      . Many of you in the first couple of rows have it underneath your seats as well. Really dig. We hid them under there. See if you can fish out the newspaper and open up to the arts section and you will find the crossword puzzle  and the crossword puzzle today was written by yours truly. You can see my name above the grid. I'm going to give this to you  Gwen  to take a look. And I will also put it up on the screen. Now let's take a look at another piece of the puzzle. If you look at the first clue for   across  it starts with the letter C  for corrupt  and just below that we have an O  for outfielder  and if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down  you get cobalt horse  amber owl  silver ox  red donkey  and emerald rooster. That's pretty cool  right  It's The New York Times. But wait  wait  wait  wait. Wait. Oh  Gwen  do you recall how I forgot my purple marker  and you were unable to color the sheep  Well  if you keep reading starting with    down  it says   Oh  by the way  the sheep can be left blank.  But wait  wait  wait  there's one more thing  there's one more thing  there's one final piece of the puzzle. Gwen  I am so grateful for your choices because if we take a look at the first letters of your combinations  we get  C H A O S  for chaos and  O R D E R  for order. That's chaos and order. We've all made order out of chaos. So ladies and gentlemen  the next time you find yourself with a puzzle  whether it's in your life or in your work  or maybe it's at the Sunday morning breakfast table with The New York Times  remember  you are all wired to solve. Thank you. Right now you have a movie playing inside your head. It's an amazing multi track movie. It has  D vision and surround sound for what you're seeing and hearing right now  but that's just the start of it. Your movie has smell and taste and touch. It has a sense of your body  pain  hunger  orgasms. It has emotions  anger and happiness. It has memories  like scenes from your childhood playing before you. And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking. At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this directly. This movie is your stream of consciousness  the subject of experience of the mind and the world. Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence. Each of us is conscious. We all have our own inner movie  you and you and you. There's nothing we know about more directly. At least  I know about my consciousness directly. I can't be certain that you guys are conscious. Consciousness also is what makes life worth living. If we weren't conscious  nothing in our lives would have meaning or value. But at the same time  it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe. Why are we conscious  Why do we have these inner movies  Why aren't we just robots who process all this input  produce all that output  without experiencing the inner movie at all  Right now  nobody knows the answers to those questions. I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science  some radical ideas may be needed. Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible. Science  by its nature  is objective. Consciousness  by its nature  is subjective. So there can never be a science of consciousness. For much of the   th century  that view held sway. Psychologists studied behavior objectively  neuroscientists studied the brain objectively  and nobody even mentioned consciousness. Even    years ago  when TED got started  there was very little scientific work on consciousness. Now  about    years ago  all that began to change. Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness. And since then  there's been a real explosion  a flowering of scientific work on consciousness. And this work has been wonderful. It's been great. But it also has some fundamental limitations so far. The centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations  correlations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness. We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago. Now we understand much better  for example  the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy. But this is still a science of correlations. It's not a science of explanations. We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience  but we don't know why they do. I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness  the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with. But in a certain sense  those are the easy problems. No knock on the neuroscientists. There are no truly easy problems with consciousness. But it doesn't address the real mystery at the core of this subject  why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all  Why is there this inner subjective movie  Right now  we don't really have a bead on that. And you might say  let's just give neuroscience a few years. It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jams  like hurricanes  like life  and we'll figure it out. The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior  how a traffic jam behaves  how a hurricane functions  how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes  all questions about objective functioning. You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena  how we walk  how we talk  how we play chess  all these questions about behavior. But when it comes to consciousness  questions about behavior are among the easy problems. When it comes to the hard problem  that's the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience  And here  the standard paradigm of emergence  even the standard paradigms of neuroscience  don't really  so far  have that much to say. Now  I'm a scientific materialist at heart. I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works  and for a long time  I banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work. But I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn't work for systematic reasons. It's a long story  but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms  in brain based terms  is stories about the functioning of a system  its structure  its dynamics  the behavior it produces  great for solving the easy problems   how we behave  how we function   but when it comes to subjective experience   why does all this feel like something from the inside    that's something fundamentally new  and it's always a further question. So I think we're at a kind of impasse here. We've got this wonderful  great chain of explanation  we're used to it  where physics explains chemistry  chemistry explains biology  biology explains parts of psychology. But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture. On the one hand  it's a datum that we're conscious. On the other hand  we don't know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world. So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly  one that we need to integrate into our view of the world  but we don't yet see how. Faced with an anomaly like this  radical ideas may be needed  and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically. Now  there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be. My friend Dan Dennett  who's here today  has one. His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness. The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confusion. Actually  all we've got to do is explain the objective functions  the behaviors of the brain  and then we've explained everything that needs to be explained. Well I say  more power to him. That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain based theory of consciousness. At the same time  for me and for many other people  that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory. So I go in a different direction. In the time remaining  I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise. The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental. Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks  space and time and mass. They postulate fundamental laws governing them  like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics. These fundamental properties and laws aren't explained in terms of anything more basic. Rather  they're taken as primitive  and you build up the world from there. Now sometimes  the list of fundamentals expands. In the   th century  Maxwell figured out that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals   space  time  mass  Newton's laws   so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern. I think that's the situation we're in with consciousness. If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals   space  time  mass  charge   then as a matter of logic  you need to expand the list. The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental  a fundamental building block of nature. This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it. This opens up the way for you to do science with it. What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness  the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals  space  time  mass  physical processes. Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t shirt. Well I think something like that is the situation we're in with consciousness. We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t shirt. We don't know what those laws are yet  but that's what we're after. The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal. Every system might have some degree of consciousness. This view is sometimes called panpsychism  pan for all  psych for mind  every system is conscious  not just humans  dogs  mice  flies  but even Rob Knight's microbes  elementary particles. Even a photon has some degree of consciousness. The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking. It's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it's thinking   Aww  I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light. I never get to slow down and smell the roses.  No  not like that. But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw  subjective feeling  some primitive precursor to consciousness. This may sound a bit kooky to you. I mean  why would anyone think such a crazy thing  Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea  that consciousness is fundamental. If it's fundamental  like space and time and mass  it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too  the way they are. It's also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us  it's much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures  where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature. A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information. Wherever there's information processing  there's consciousness. Complex information processing  like in a human  complex consciousness. Simple information processing  simple consciousness. A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist  Giulio Tononi  has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory. He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi  measuring the amount of information integrated in a system. And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness. So in a human brain  incredibly large amount of information integration  high degree of phi  a whole lot of consciousness. In a mouse  medium degree of information integration  still pretty significant  pretty serious amount of consciousness. But as you go down to worms  microbes  particles  the amount of phi falls off. The amount of information integration falls off  but it's still non zero. On Tononi's theory  there's still going to be a non zero degree of consciousness. In effect  he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness  high phi  high consciousness. Now  I don't know if this theory is right  but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness  and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data  and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t shirt. Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world. Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract. It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations  but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it. As Stephen Hawking puts it  what puts the fire into the equations  Well  on the panpsychist view  you can leave the equations of physics as they are  but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness. That's what physics really is ultimately doing  describing the flux of consciousness. On this view  it's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations. On that view  consciousness doesn't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra. It's there right at its heart. This view  I think  the panpsychist view  has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature  and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences. Some of these may be counterintuitive. I used to think I shouldn't eat anything which is conscious  so therefore I should be vegetarian. Now  if you're a panpsychist and you take that view  you're going to go very hungry. So I think when you think about it  this tends to transfigure your views  whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations  not so much the fact of consciousness  but the degree and the complexity of consciousness. It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems  like computers. What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie  Her   Samantha  Is she conscious  Well  if you take the informational  panpsychist view  she certainly has complicated information processing and integration  so the answer is very likely yes  she is conscious. If that's right  it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off. Finally  you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups  the planet. Does Canada have its own consciousness  Or at a more local level  does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference  are we right now having a collective TED consciousness  an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts  I don't know the answer to that question  but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously. Okay  so this panpsychist vision  it is a radical one  and I don't know that it's correct. I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea  that consciousness is fundamental  than about the second one  that it's universal. I mean  the view raises any number of questions  has any number of challenges  like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love. If we can answer those questions  then I think we're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness. If not  well  this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy. We can't expect to solve it overnight. But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually. Understanding consciousness is a real key  I think  both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves. It may just take the right crazy idea. Thank you. The first time I stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery  I had no idea what to expect. I was a college student in engineering. I thought it was going to be like on TV. Ominous music playing in the background  beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face. But it wasn't like that at all. There was music playing on this day  I think it was Madonna's greatest hits.  Laughter  And there was plenty of conversation  not just about the patient's heart rate  but about sports and weekend plans. And since then  the more surgeries I watched  the more I realized this is how it is. In some weird way  it's just another day at the office. But every so often the music gets turned down  everyone stops talking  and stares at exactly the same thing. And that's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening. The first time I saw that I was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery And for those of you who are unfamiliar  laparoscopic surgery  instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery  a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates these three or more small incisions in the patient. And then inserts these long  thin instruments and a camera  and actually does the procedure inside the patient. This is great because there's much less risk of infection  much less pain  shorter recovery time. But there is a trade off  because these incisions are created with a long  pointed device called a trocar. And the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through. And now the reason why  everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs  and blood vessels below. But this problem should seem  pretty familiar to all of you because I'm pretty sure  you've seen it somewhere else. Remember this  You knew that at any second that straw was going to plunge through  and you didn't know if it was  going to go out the other side and straight into your hand  or if you were going to get juice everywhere  but you were terrified. Right  Every single time you did this  you experienced the same fundamental physics that I was watching in the operating room that day. And it turns out it really is a problem. In       the FDA actually came out and said that trocar incisions might  be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery. Again in       we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery. And  oh by the way  this hasn't changed for    years. So when I got to graduate school  this is what I wanted to work on. I was trying to explain to a friend of mine what exactly I was spending my time doing  and I said   It's like when you're drilling through a wall to hang something in your apartment. There's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall and there's this plunge. Right  And he looked at me and he said   You mean like when they drill  into people's brains   And I said   Excuse me    Laughter  And then I looked it up and they do drill into people's brains. A lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull. And if the surgeon isn't careful  he can plunge directly into the brain. So this is the moment when I started thinking  okay  cranial drilling  laparoscopic surgery  why not other areas of medicine  Because think about it  when was the last time you went to the doctor and you didn't get stuck with something  Right  So the truth is in medicine puncture is everywhere. And here are just a couple of the procedures that I've found that involve some tissue puncture step. And if we take just three of them   laparoscopic surgery   epidurals  and cranial drilling   these procedures account  for over        complications every year in this country alone. I call that a problem worth solving. So let's take a look at some of the devices that are used in these types of procedures. I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle. It's used to puncture through  the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth. Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools. These are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions. Here's a bayonette from the Civil War. If I had told you it was a  medical puncture device you probably would have believed me. Because what's the difference  So  the more I did this research the more I thought there has to be a better way to do this. And for me the key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics. So what are those physics  Let's go back to drilling through a wall. So you're applying a force  on a drill towards the wall. And Newton says the wall is going to apply force back  equal and opposite. So  as you drill through the wall  those forces balance. But then there's that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall  and right at that moment  the wall can't push back anymore. But your brain hasn't reacted  to that change in force. So for that millisecond  or however long it takes you  to react  you're still pushing  and that unbalanced force  causes an acceleration  and that is the plunge. But what if right at the moment of puncture you could pull that tip back  actually oppose the forward acceleration  That's what I set out to do. So imagine you have a device and it's got some kind of sharp tip  to cut through tissue. What's the simplest way  you could pull that tip back  I chose a spring. So when you extend that spring   you extend that tip out so it's ready to puncture tissue  the spring wants to pull the tip back. How do you keep the tip in place until the moment of puncture  I used this mechanism. When the tip of the device is pressed against tissue  the mechanism expands outwards  and wedges in place against the wall. And the friction that's generated locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip. But right at the moment of puncture  the tissue can't push back on the tip anymore. So the mechanism unlocks  and the spring retracts the tip. Let me show you that  happening in slow motion. This is about       frames a second  and I'd like you to notice the tip that's right there on the bottom   about to puncture through tissue. And you'll see that  right at the moment of puncture  right there  the mechanism unlocks  and retracts that tip back. I want to show it to you again  a little closer up. You're going to see the sharp bladed tip  and right when it punctures  that rubber membrane it's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath. Right there. That happens within four    ths  of a second after puncture. And because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery   or another procedure  it's applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales. But it didn't always look like this. This was my first prototype. Yes  those are popsicle sticks  and there's a rubber band at the top. It took about    minutes to do this  but it worked. And it proved to me that my idea worked and it justified the next couple years of work on this project. I worked on this because this problem really fascinated me. It kept me up at night. But I think it should fascinate you too  because I said puncture is everywhere. That means at some point  it's going to be your problem too. That first day in the operating room I never expected to find myself  on the other end of a trocar. But last year  I got appendicitis  when I was visiting Greece. So I was in the hospital in Athens  and the surgeon was telling me he was going to perform  a laparoscopic surgery. He was going to remove my appendix  through these tiny incisions  and he was talking about what I could expect for the recovery  and what was going to happen. He said   Do you have any questions   And I said   Just one  doc. What kind of trocar do you use   So my favorite quote  about laparoscopic surgery comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus   It is puncture itself that causes risk.  That's my favorite quote  because H.C. Jacobaeus was the first person to ever perform  laparoscopic surgery on humans  and he wrote that in     . This is a problem that's been injuring and even killing people for over     years. So it's easy to think that for every major problem out there there's some team of experts  working around the clock to solve it. The truth is that's not always the case. We have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them. So if you come across a problem that grabs you  let it keep you up at night. Allow yourself to be fascinated  because there are so many lives to save. I was born in Taiwan. I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores  and I like going to night markets. I love the energy of the night markets  the colors  the lights  the toys  and all the unexpected things I find every time I go  things like watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks. When I was growing up  I liked taking toys apart  any kind of toys I'd find around the house  like my brother's BB gun when he's not home. I also liked to make environments for people to explore and play. In these early installations  I would take plastic sheets  plastic bags  and things I would find in the hardware store or around the house. I would take things like highlighter pen  mix it with water  pump it through plastic tubing  creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy. I like these materials because of the way they look  the way they feel  and they're very affordable. I also liked to make devices that work with body parts. I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would videotape my belly button  get a different perspective  and see what it does. I also like to modify household appliances. This is an automatic night light. Some of you might have them at home. I would cut out the light sensor  add an extension line  and use modeling clay  stick it onto the television  and then I would videotape my eye  and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time  so you turn on the lightbulb. The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime  and it will shut off the light. I wanted to collect more different types of eyes  so I built this device using bicycle helmets  some lightbulbs and television sets. It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes. This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes  so I have a diversity of eyes to use for my other sculptures. This sculpture has four eyes. Each eye is controlling a different device. This eye is turning itself around in a television. This eye is inflating a plastic tube. This eye is watching a video of another piece being made. And these two eyes are activating glowing water. Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums  biennials  triennial exhibitions around the world. I love science and biology. In       I was doing a research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean. I love these creatures. I love the way they look  the way they feel. They're soft  they're slimy  and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment  either to attract mates  for self defense  or to attract food. This research inspired my work in many different ways  things like movement or different light patterns. So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out  trying that out  and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with. I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens. This is an       square foot installation composed of many different creatures  some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor. From afar  they look alien like  but when you look closer  they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers. I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous. Thank you. I'd like to introduce you to an organism  a slime mold  Physarum polycephalum. It's a mold with an identity crisis  because it's not a mold  so let's get that straight to start with. It is one of     known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba. It is a single celled organism  a cell  that joins together with other cells to form a mass super cell to maximize its resources. So within a slime mold you might find thousands or millions of nuclei  all sharing a cell wall  all operating as one entity. In its natural habitat  you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands  eating rotting vegetation  but you might equally find it in research laboratories  classrooms  and even artists' studios. I first came across the slime mold about five years ago. A microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it. The only instructions I was given  that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats. I'm an artist who's worked for many years with biology  with scientific processes  so living material is not uncommon for me. I've worked with plants  bacteria  cuttlefish  fruit flies. So I was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do. So I took it home and I watched. I fed it a varied diet. I observed as it networked. It formed a connection between food sources. I watched it leave a trail behind it  indicating where it had been. And I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish  it would escape and find a better home. I captured my observations through time lapse photography. Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour  so it's not really ideal for live viewing unless there's some form of really extreme meditation  but through the time lapse  I could observe some really interesting behaviors. For instance  having fed on a nice pile of oats  the slime mold goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously. When it meets itself  it knows it's already there  it recognizes it's there  and instead retreats back and grows in other directions. I was quite impressed by this feat  at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory  know itself  and move with seeming intention. I found countless scientific studies  research papers  journal articles  all citing incredible work with this one organism  and I'm going to share a few of those with you. For example  a team in Hokkaido University in Japan filled a maze with slime mold. It joined together and formed a mass cell. They introduced food at two points  oats of course  and it formed a connection between the food. It retracted from empty areas and dead ends. There are four possible routes through this maze  yet time and time again  the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route. Quite clever. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence. Another study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold. It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold. It doesn't like it dry. They did this at repeat intervals  and each time  the slime mold slowed down its growth in response. However  at the next interval  the researchers didn't put the cold air on  yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening. It somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn't like. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn. A third experiment  the slime mold was invited to explore a territory covered in oats. It fans out in a branching pattern. As it goes  each food node it finds  it forms a network  a connection to  and keeps foraging. After    hours  it established quite a firm network between the different oats. Now there's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of Tokyo  and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations. The slime mold had replicated the Tokyo transport network    Laughter    a complex system developed over time by community dwellings  civil engineering  urban planning. What had taken us well over     years took the slime mold just over a day. The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem. It is a biological computer. As such  it has been mathematically modeled  algorithmically analyzed. It's been sonified  replicated  simulated. World over  teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics  programming and robotics. So the question is  how does this thing work  It doesn't have a central nervous system. It doesn't have a brain  yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function. It can learn  it can remember  it can solve problems  it can make decisions. So where does that intelligence lie  So this is a microscopy  a video I shot  and it's about     times magnification  sped up about    times  and inside the slime mold  there is a rhythmic pulsing flow  a vein like structure carrying cellular material  nutrients and chemical information through the cell  streaming first in one direction and then back in another. And it is this continuous  synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment  but without any large scale control center. This is where its intelligence lies. So it's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism. A few years ago  I set up SliMoCo  the Slime Mould Collective. It's an online  open  democratic network for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation across disciplinary divides and across academic divides. The Slime Mould Collective membership is self selecting. People have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats. And it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers but also artists like me  architects  designers  writers  activists  you name it. It's a very interesting  eclectic membership. Just a few examples  an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum  a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with  D printing technologies in a workshop  another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area. Here  the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool  but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion  communication and cooperation. Other public engagement activities  I run lots of slime mold workshops  a creative way of engaging with the organism. So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do  and they design their own petri dish experiment  an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties. Everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the Slime Mould Collective. And the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people. I've been working with filmmakers on a feature length slime mold documentary  and I stress feature length  which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon. It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is the world's first human slime mold experiment. This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year. We invited people to become slime mold for half an hour. So we essentially tied people together so they were a giant cell  and invited them to follow slime mold rules. You have to communicate through oscillations  no speaking. You have to operate as one entity  one mass cell  no egos  and the motivation for moving and then exploring the environment is in search of food. So a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers tied together with yellow ropes wearing  Being Slime Mold  t shirts wandered through the museum park. When they met trees  they had to reshape their connections and reform as a mass cell through not speaking. This is a ludicrous experiment in many  many ways. This isn't hypothesis driven. We're not trying to prove  demonstrate anything. But what it did provide us was a way of engaging a broad section of the public with ideas of intelligence  agency  autonomy  and provide a playful platform for discussions about the things that ensued. One of the most exciting things about this experiment was the conversation that happened afterwards. An entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park. People talked about the human psychology  of how difficult it was to let go of their individual personalities and egos. Other people talked about bacterial communication. Each person brought in their own individual interpretation  and our conclusion from this experiment was that the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative  especially when given beer. We didn't just give them oats. We gave them beer as well. But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold  and the slime mold  for me  is a fascinating subject matter. It's biologically fascinating  it's computationally interesting  but it's also a symbol  a way of engaging with ideas of community  collective behavior  cooperation. A lot of my work draws on the scientific research  so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way. And the slime mold is also my working material. It's a coproducer of photographs  prints  animations  participatory events. Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose to work with me  exactly  it is a collaboration of sorts. I can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates  but I can't control it. The slime mold has the final say in the creative process. And after all  it has its own internal aesthetics. These branching patterns that we see we see across all forms  scales of nature  from river deltas to lightning strikes  from our own blood vessels to neural networks. There's clearly significant rules at play in this simple yet complex organism  and no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry  there's a great deal that we can learn from observing and engaging with this beautiful  brainless blob.

You have now completed the test. You are all human. I would like to share with you a new model of higher education  a model that  once expanded  can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind. Look at the world. Pick up a place and focus on it. You will find humans chasing higher education. Let's meet some of them. Patrick. Patrick was born in Liberia to a family of    children. During the civil war  he and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria. There  in spite of his situation  he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades. He wanted to continue to higher education  but due to his family living on the poverty line  he was soon sent to South Africa to work and send back money to feed his family. Patrick never gave up his dream of higher education. Late at night  after work  he surfed the Net looking for ways to study. Meet Debbie. Debbie is from Florida. Her parents didn't go to college  and neither did any of her siblings. Debbie has worked all her life  pays taxes  supports herself month to month  proud of the American dream  a dream that just won't be complete without higher education. But Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education. She can't pay the tuition. Neither could she leave work. Meet Wael. Wael is from Syria. He's firsthand experiencing the misery  fear and failure imposed on his country. He's a big believer in education. He knew that if he would find an opportunity for higher education  an opportunity to get ahead of the rest  he has a better chance to survive in a world turned upside down. The higher education system failed Patrick  Debbie and Wael  exactly as it is failing millions of potential students  millions that graduate high school  millions that are qualified for higher education  millions that want to study yet cannot access for various reasons. First  financial. Universities are expensive. We all know it. In large parts of the world  higher education is unattainable for an average citizen. This is probably the biggest problem facing our society. Higher education stopped being a right for all and became a privilege for the few. Second  cultural. Students who are qualified for higher education  can afford  want to study  cannot because it is not decent  it is not a place for a woman. This is the story of countless women in Africa  for example  prevented from higher education because of cultural barriers. And here comes the third reason  UNESCO stated that in           million students will be deprived from higher education simply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them  to meet the demand. They will take a placement test  they will pass it  but they still won't have access because there are no places available. These are the reasons I founded University of the People  a nonprofit  tuition free  degree granting university to give an alternative  to create an alternative to those who have no other  an alternative that will be affordable and scalable  an alternative that will disrupt the current education system  open the gates to higher education for every qualified student regardless of what they earn  where they live  or what society says about them. Patrick  Debbie and Wael are only three examples out of the       accepted students from     countries. We    Applause    Thank you. We didn't need to reinvent the wheel. We just looked at what wasn't working and used the amazing power of the Internet to get around it. We set out to build a model that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education  and that's how we did it. First  bricks and mortar cost money. Universities have expenses that virtual universities don't. We don't need to pass these expenses onto our students. They don't exist. We also don't need to worry about capacity. There are no limits of seats in virtual university. Actually  nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall. Textbooks is also something our students don't need to buy. By using open educational resources and the generosity of professors who are putting their material free and accessible  we don't need to send our students to buy textbooks. All of our materials come free. Even professors  the most expensive line in any university balance sheet  come free to our students  over       of them  including presidents  vice chancellors  professors and academic advisors from top universities such as NYU  Yale  Berkeley and Oxford  came on board to help our students. Finally  it's our belief in peer to peer learning. We use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments. If the Internet has made us a global village  this model can develop its future leadership. Look how we do it. We only offer two programs  business administration and computer science  the two programs that are most in demand worldwide  the two programs that are likeliest to help our students find a job. When our students are accepted  they are placed in a small classroom of    to    students to ensure that those who need personalized attention get it. Moreover  for every nine weeks' course  they meet a new peer  a whole new set of students from all over the world. Every week  when they go into the classroom  they find the lecture notes of the week  the reading assignment  the homework assignment  and the discussion question  which is the core of our studies. Every week  every student must contribute to the class discussion and also must comment on the contribution of others. This way  we open our students' minds  we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures. By the end of each week  the students take a quiz  hand in their homework  which are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors  get a grade  move to the next week. By the end of the course  they take the final exam  get a grade  and follow to the next course. We opened the gates for higher education for every qualified student. Every student with a high school diploma  sufficient English and Internet connection can study with us. We don't use audio. We don't use video. Broadband is not necessary. Any student from any part of the world with any Internet connection can study with us. We are tuition free. All we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams      dollars per exam. A full time bachelor degree student taking    courses  will pay       dollars a year        dollars for the entire degree  and for those who cannot afford even this  we offer them a variety of scholarships. It is our mission that nobody will be left behind for financial reasons. With       students in       this model is financially sustainable. Five years ago  it was a vision. Today  it is a reality. Last month  we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model. University of the People is now fully accredited. Thank you. With this accreditation  it's our time now to scale up. We have demonstrated that our model works. I invite universities and  even more important  developing countries' governments  to replicate this model to ensure that the gates of higher education will open widely. A new era is coming  an era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model as we know it today  from being a privilege for the few to becoming a basic right  affordable and accessible for all. Thank you. What do you think of when I say the word  design   You probably think of things like this  finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand  or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things  classic icons of timeless design. But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design. I want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to  designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket. I'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend. Consider the fact that Google processes over one billion search queries every day  that every minute  over     hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube. That's more in a single day than all three major U.S. networks broadcast in the last five years combined. And Facebook transmitting the photos  messages and stories of over  .   billion people. That's almost half of the Internet population  and a sixth of humanity. These are some of the products that I've helped design over the course of my career  and their scale is so massive that they've produced unprecedented design challenges. But what is really hard about designing at scale is this  It's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things  audacity and humility   audacity to believe that the thing that you're making is something that the entire world wants and needs  and humility to understand that as a designer  it's not about you or your portfolio  it's about the people that you're designing for  and how your work just might help them live better lives. Now  unfortunately  there's no school that offers the course Designing for Humanity    . I and the other designers who work on these kinds of products have had to invent it as we go along  and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale  and today I'd like share some of the things that we've learned over the years. Now  the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter. Here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact. The team at Facebook that manages the Facebook  Like  button decided that it needed to be redesigned. The button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized. Now you might think  well  it's a tiny little button  it probably is a pretty straightforward  easy design assignment  but it wasn't. Turns out  there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button. You had to work within specific height and width parameters. You had to be careful to make it work in a bunch of different languages  and be careful about using fancy gradients or borders because it has to degrade gracefully in old web browsers. The truth is  designing this tiny little button was a huge pain in the butt. Now  this is the new version of the button  and the designer who led this project estimates that he spent over     hours redesigning this button over the course of months. Now  why would we spend so much time on something so small  It's because when you're designing at scale  there's no such thing as a small detail. This innocent little button is seen on average    billion times a day and on over  .  million websites. It's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created. Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button and the designer behind it  but with these kinds of products  you need to get even the tiny things right. Now  the next thing that you need to understand is how to design with data. Now  when you're working on products like this  you have incredible amounts of information about how people are using your product that you can then use to influence your design decisions  but it's not just as simple as following the numbers. Let me give you an example so that you can understand what I mean. Facebook has had a tool for a long time that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of our community standards  things like spam and abuse. And there were a ton of photos reported  but as it turns out  only a small percentage were actually in violation of those community standards. Most of them were just your typical party photo. Now  to give you a specific hypothetical example  let's say my friend Laura hypothetically uploads a picture of me from a drunken night of karaoke. This is purely hypothetical  I can assure you. Now  incidentally  you know how some people are kind of worried that their boss or employee is going to discover embarrassing photos of them on Facebook  Do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at Facebook  So anyway  there are lots of these photos being erroneously reported as spam and abuse  and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch. He really thought there was something else going on and he was right  because when he looked through a bunch of the cases  he found that most of them were from people who were requesting the takedown of a photo of themselves. Now this was a scenario that the team never even took into account before. So they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down. But it didn't work. Only    percent of people sent the message to their friend. So the team went back at it. They consulted with experts in conflict resolution. They even studied the universal principles of polite language  which I didn't even actually know existed until this research happened. And they found something really interesting. They had to go beyond just helping people ask their friend to take the photo down. They had to help people express to their friend how the photo made them feel. Here's how the experience works today. So I find this hypothetical photo of myself  and it's not spam  it's not abuse  but I really wish it weren't on the site. So I report it and I say   I'm in this photo and I don't like it   and then we dig deeper. Why don't you like this photo of yourself  And I select  It's embarrassing.  And then I'm encouraged to message my friend  but here's the critical difference. I'm provided specific suggested language that helps me communicate to Laura how the photo makes me feel. Now the team found that this relatively small change had a huge impact. Before  only    percent of people were sending the message  and now    percent were  and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result. That same survey showed that    percent of your friends want to know if they've done something to upset you. Now I don't know who the other    percent are  but maybe that's where our  Unfriend  feature can come in handy. So as you can see  these decisions are highly nuanced. Of course we use a lot of data to inform our decisions  but we also rely very heavily on iteration  research  testing  intuition  human empathy. It's both art and science. Now  sometimes the designers who work on these products are called  data driven   which is a term that totally drives us bonkers. The fact is  it would be irresponsible of us not to rigorously test our designs when so many people are counting on us to get it right  but data analytics will never be a substitute for design intuition. Data can help you make a good design great  but it will never made a bad design good. The next thing that you need to understand as a principle is that when you introduce change  you need to do it extraordinarily carefully. Now I often have joked that I spend almost as much time designing the introduction of change as I do the change itself  and I'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust. The fact is  people can become very efficient at using bad design  and so even if the change is good for them in the long run  it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens  and this is particularly true with user generated content platforms  because people can rightfully claim a sense of ownership. It is  after all  their content. Now  years ago  when I was working at YouTube  we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos  and it was interesting because when we looked into the data  we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five star rating  a handful of people were using the lowest one star  and virtually no one was using two  three or four stars. So we decided to simplify into an up down kind of voting binary model. It's going to be much easier for people to engage with. But people were very attached to the five star rating system. Video creators really loved their ratings. Millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design. So in order to help people prepare themselves for change and acclimate to the new design more quickly  we actually published the data graph sharing with the community the rationale for what we were going to do  and it even engaged the larger industry in a conversation  which resulted in my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time   YouTube Comes to a   Star Realization  Its Ratings Are Useless.  Now  it's impossible to completely avoid change aversion when you're making changes to products that so many people use. Even though we tried to do all the right things  we still received our customary flood of video protests and angry emails and even a package that had to be scanned by security  but we have to remember people care intensely about this stuff  and it's because these products  this work  really  really matters to them. Now  we know that we have to be careful about paying attention to the details  we have to be cognizant about how we use data in our design process  and we have to introduce change very  very carefully. Now  these things are all really useful. They're good best practices for designing at scale. But they don't mean anything if you don't understand something much more fundamental. You have to understand who you are designing for. Now  when you set a goal to design for the entire human race  and you start to engage in that goal in earnest  at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you're living in. Now  in San Francisco  we get a little miffed when we hit a dead cell zone because we can't use our phones to navigate to the new hipster coffee shop. But what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity  What if you had no access to public libraries  What if your country had no free press  What would these products start to mean to you  This is what Google  YouTube and Facebook look like to most of the world  and it's what they'll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online. Designing for low end cell phones is not glamorous design work  but if you want to design for the whole world  you have to design for where people are  and not where you are. So how do we keep this big  big picture in mind  We try to travel outside of our bubble to see  hear and understand the people we're designing for. We use our products in non English languages to make sure that they work just as well. And we try to use one of these phones from time to time to keep in touch with their reality. So what does it mean to design at a global scale  It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work to try to improve and evolve products. Finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them can be pretty exhausting  and the humility part  it's a little tough on the design ego. Because these products are always changing  everything that I've designed in my career is pretty much gone  and everything that I will design will fade away. But here's what remains  the never ending thrill of being a part of something that is so big  you can hardly get your head around it  and the promise that it just might change the world. Thank you. This year  Germany is celebrating the   th anniversary of the peaceful revolution in East Germany. In       the Communist regime was moved away  the Berlin Wall came down  and one year later  the German Democratic Republic  the GDR  in the East was unified with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West to found today's Germany. Among many other things  Germany inherited the archives of the East German secret police  known as the Stasi. Only two years after its dissolution  its documents were opened to the public  and historians such as me started to study these documents to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state functioned. Perhaps you have watched the movie  The Lives of Others.  This movie made the Stasi known worldwide  and as we live in an age where words such as  surveillance  or  wiretapping  are on the front pages of newspapers  I would like to speak about how the Stasi really worked. At the beginning  let's have a short look at the history of the Stasi  because it's really important for understanding its self conception. Its origins are located in Russia. In       the Russian Communists founded the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter Revolution and Sabotage  shortly Cheka. It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky. The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing their enemies. It evolved later into the well known KGB. The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers. They called themselves Chekists  and even the emblem was very similar  as you can see here. In fact  the secret police of Russia was the creator and instructor of the Stasi. When the Red Army occupied East Germany in       it immediately expanded there  and soon it started to train the German Communists to build up their own secret police. By the way  in this hall where we are now  the ruling party of the GDR was founded in     . Five years later  the Stasi was established  and step by step  the dirty job of oppression was handed over to it. For instance  the central jail for political prisoners  which was established by the Russians  was taken over by the Stasi and used until the end of Communism. You see it here. At the beginning  every important step took place under the attendance of the Russians. But the Germans are known to be very effective  so the Stasi grew very quickly  and already in       it had more employees than the Gestapo had  the secret police of Nazi Germany. The number doubled in each decade. In       more than        employees worked for the Stasi. This meant that one employee was responsible for     inhabitants  which was really unique in the world. At the top of this tremendous apparatus  there was one man  Erich Mielke. He ruled the Ministry of State Security for more than    years. He was a scrupulous functionary   in his past  he killed two policemen not far away from here   who in fact personalized the Stasi. But what was so exceptional about the Stasi  Foremost  it was its enormous power  because it united different functions in one organization. First of all  the Stasi was an intelligence service. It used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly  such as informers  or tapping phones  as you can see it on the picture here. And it was not only active in East Germany  but all over the world. Secondly  the Stasi was a secret police. It could stop people on the street and arrest them in its own prisons. Thirdly  the Stasi worked as a kind of public prosecutor. It had the right to open preliminary investigations and to interrogate people officially. Last but not least  the Stasi had its own armed forces. More than        soldiers were serving in its so called Guards Regiment. It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings. Due to this concentration of power  the Stasi was called a state in the state. But let's look in more and more detail at the tools of the Stasi. Please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented. Of course  the Stasi used all kinds of technical instruments to survey people. Telephones were wiretapped  including the phone of the German chancellor in the West  and often also the apartments. Every day         letters were being opened by these machines. The Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took. In this picture  you can see me as a young man just in front of this building where we are now  photographed by a Stasi agent. The Stasi even collected the smell of people. It stored samples of it in closed jars which were found after the peaceful revolution. For all these tasks  highly specialized departments were responsible. The one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters  for good reasons  because if one agent quit the Stasi  his knowledge was very small. Contrast that with Snowden  for example. But the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation. The agent who shadowed me didn't know who I was or why I was surveyed. In fact  I smuggled forbidden books from West to East Germany. But what was even more typical for the Stasi was the use of human intelligence  people who reported secretly to the Stasi. For the Minister of State Security  these so called unofficial employees were the most important tools. From      on  nearly         people collaborated constantly with the Stasi  more than one percent of the population. And in a way  the minister was right  because technical instruments can only register what people are doing  but agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking. Therefore  the Stasi recruited so many informants. The system of how to get them and how to educate them  as it was called  was very sophisticated. The Stasi had its own university  not far away from here  where the methods were explored and taught to the officers. This guideline gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens. Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured to becoming one  but that's mostly not true  because a forced informant is a bad informant. Only someone who wants to give you the information you need is an effective whistleblower. The main reasons why people cooperated with the Stasi were political conviction and material benefits. The officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant  and to be honest  the example of the Stasi shows that it's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others. Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany collaborated with the Stasi  as for instance Ibrahim B hme. In       he was the leader of the peaceful revolution and he nearly became the first freely elected Prime Minister of the GDR until it came out that he was an informant. The net of spies was really broad. In nearly every institution  even in the churches or in West Germany  there were many of them. I remember telling a leading Stasi officer   If you had sent an informant to me  I would surely have recognized him.  His answer was   We didn't send anyone. We took those who were around you.  And in fact  two of my best friends reported about me to the Stasi. Not only in my case  informers were very close. For example  Vera Lengsfeld  another leading dissident  in her case it was her husband who spied on her. A famous writer was betrayed by his brother. This reminds me of the novel        by George Orwell  where the only apparently trustable person was an informer. But why did the Stasi collect all this information in its archives  The main purpose was to control the society. In nearly every speech  the Stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who  which meant who thinks what. He didn't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime. He wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and planning. The East Germans knew  of course  that they were surrounded by informers  in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust and a state of widespread fear  the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship. That's why not many East Germans tried to fight against the Communist regime. If yes  the Stasi often used a method which was really diabolic. It was called Zersetzung  and it's described in another guideline. The word is difficult to translate because it means originally  biodegradation.  But actually  it's a quite accurate description. The goal was to destroy secretly the self confidence of people  for example by damaging their reputation  by organizing failures in their work  and by destroying their personal relationships. Considering this  East Germany was a very modern dictatorship. The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident. It preferred to paralyze them  and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions. Detaining someone was used only as a last resort. For this  the Stasi owned    remand prisons  one in every district. Here  the Stasi also developed quite modern methods of detention. Normally  the interrogation officer didn't torture the prisoner. Instead  he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central. Nearly no prisoner resisted without giving a testimony. If you have the occasion  do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner who will explain to you how this worked. One more question needs to be answered  If the Stasi were so well organized  why did the Communist regime collapse  First  in       the leadership in East Germany was uncertain what to do against the growing protest of people. It was especially confused because in the mother country of socialism  the Soviet Union  a more liberal policy took place. In addition  the regime was dependent on the loans from the West. Therefore  no order to crash down the uprising was given to the Stasi. Secondly  in the Communist ideology  there's no place for criticism. Instead  the leadership stuck to the belief that socialism is a perfect system  and the Stasi had to confirm that  of course. The consequence was that despite all the information  the regime couldn't analyze its real problems  and therefore it couldn't solve them. In the end  the Stasi died because of the structures that it was charged with protecting. The ending of the Stasi was something tragic  because these officers were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing  to destroy the documents they had produced during decades. Fortunately  they had been stopped by human rights activists. That's why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state functions. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Thank you very much. So Hubertus  I want to ask you a couple of questions because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.  Mein Nachbar NSA.  My neighbor  the NSA. And you just told us about my neighbor  the spies and the informant from East Germany. So there is a direct link between these two stories or there isn't  What's your reaction as a historian when you see this  Hubertus Knabe  I think there are several aspects to mention. At first  I think there's a difference of why you are collecting this data. Are you doing that for protecting your people against terrorist attacks  or are you doing that for oppressing your people  So that makes a fundamental difference. But on the other hand  also in a democracy  these instruments can be abused  and that is something where we really have to be aware to stop that  and that also the intelligence services are respecting the rules we have. The third point  probably  we really can be happy that we live in a democracy  because you can be sure that Russia and China are doing the same  but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that. BG  When the story came out first  last July  last year  you filed a criminal complaint with a German tribunal. Why  HK  Yeah  I did so because of the second point I mentioned  that I think especially in a democracy  the rules are for everybody. They are made for everybody  so it's not allowed that any institution doesn't respect the rules. In the criminal code of Germany  it's written that it's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the judge. Fortunately  it's written in the criminal code of Germany  so if it's not respected  then I think an investigation is necessary  and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of Germany started this  and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel  and not in the case of all the other people living in Germany. BG  That doesn't surprise me because   because of the story you told. Seen from the outside  I live outside of Germany  and I expected the Germans to react much more strongly  immediately. And instead  the reaction really came only when Chancellor Merkel was revealed as being wiretapped. Why so  HK  I take it as a good sign  because people feel secure in this democracy. They aren't afraid that they will be arrested  and if you leave this hall after the conference  nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you. So that's a good sign  I think. People are not really scared  as they could be. But of course  I think  the institutions are responsible to stop illegal actions in Germany or wherever they happen. BG  A personal question  and this is the last one. There has been a debate in Germany about granting asylum to Edward Snowden. Would you be in favor or against  HK  Oh  that's a difficult question  but if you ask me  and if I answer honestly  I would give him the asylum  because I think it was really brave what he did  and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything. So I think  for these people  we should do something  and especially if you see the German history  where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn't get it  so it would be a good sign to give him asylum. BG  Hubertus  thank you very much. Take a look at this drawing. Can you tell what it is  I'm a molecular biologist by training  and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings. They're usually referred to as a model figure  a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs. This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin mediated endocytosis. It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell. There's a problem with this drawing  though  and it's mainly in what it doesn't show. From lots of experiments  from lots of different scientists  we know a lot about what these molecules look like  how they move around in the cell  and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment. So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen  we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that. So we start outside of the cell. Now we're looking inside. Clathrin are these three legged molecules that can self assemble into soccer ball like shapes. Through connections with a membrane  clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble  or a vesicle  that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell. Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle  making it separate from the rest of the membrane  and now clathrin is basically done with its job  and so proteins are coming in now   we've covered them yellow and orange   that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage. And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again. These processes are too small to be seen directly  even with the best microscopes  so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis. Here's another illustration  and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells. And again  this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually know about these processes. You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses. Why  Because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard. I spent months in Hollywood learning  D animation software  and I spend months on each animation  and that's just time that most researchers can't afford. The payoffs can be huge  though. Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy. And I'm working on a new project now called  The Science of HIV  where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail. The animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades  data on what this virus looks like  how it's able to infect cells in our body  and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection. Over the years  I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an idea  but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis. Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study  and with the data we have now  that's just not good enough anymore. The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas. One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together  and in this way  animation can feed back into the research process. I believe that animation can change biology. It can change the way that we communicate with one another  how we explore our data and how we teach our students. But for that change to happen  we need more researchers creating animations  and toward that end  I brought together a team of biologists  animators and programmers to create a new  free  open source software   we call it Molecular Flipbook   that's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations. From our testing  we've found that it only takes    minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis. We're also building an online database where anyone can view  download and contribute their own animations. We're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today. We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures. Thank you. I didn't know when I agreed to do this whether I was expected to talk or to sing. But when I was told that the topic was language  I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment. I have a problem. It's not the worst thing in the world. I'm fine. I'm not on fire. I know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with  but for me  language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing. And the thing is that I have a stutter. It might seem curious given that I spend a lot of my life on the stage. One would assume that I'm comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here  speaking to you guys. But the truth is that I've spent my life up until this point and including this point  living in mortal dread of public speaking. Public singing  whole different thing.  Laughter  But we'll get to that in a moment. I've never really talked about it before so explicitly. I think that that's because I've always lived in hope that when I was a grown up  I wouldn't have one. I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown  I'll have learned to speak French  and when I'm grown  I'll learn how to manage my money  and when I'm grown  I won't have a stutter  and then I'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything's possible and  you know. So I can talk about it now because I've reached this point  where   I mean  I'm   . I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now. And I'm an adult woman who spends her life as a performer  with a speech impediment. So  I might as well come clean about it. There are some interesting angles to having a stutter. For me  the worst thing that can happen is meeting another stutterer. This happened to me in Hamburg  when this guy  we met and he said   Hello  m m m my name is Joe   and I said   Oh  hello  m m m my name is Meg.  Imagine my horror when I realized he thought I was making fun of him. People think I'm drunk all the time. People think that I've forgotten their name when I hesitate before saying it. And it is a very weird thing  because proper nouns are the worst. If I'm going to use the word  Wednesday  in a sentence  and I'm coming up to the word  and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something  I can change the word to  tomorrow   or  the day after Tuesday   or something else. It's clunky  but you can get away with it  because over time I've developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain. But with people's names  you can't change them. When I was singing a lot of jazz  I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve. As you can probably gather  S's and T's  together or independently  are my kryptonite. But I would have to introduce the band over this rolling vamp  and when I got around to Steve  I'd often find myself stuck on the  St.  And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable  and it totally kills the vibe. So after a few instances of this  Steve happily became  Seve   and we got through it that way.  Laughter  I've had a lot of therapy  and a common form of treatment is to use this technique that's called smooth speech  which is where you almost sing everything that you say. You kind of join everything together in this very singsong  kindergarten teacher way  and it makes you sound very serene  like you've had lots of Valium  and everything is calm.  Laughter  That's not actually me. And I do use that. I do. I use it when I have to be on panel shows  or when I have to do radio interviews  when the economy of airtime is paramount. I get through it that way for my job. But as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real  that feels often like cheating. Which is why before I sing  I wanted to tell you what singing means to me. It's more than making nice sounds  and it's more than making nice songs. It's more than feeling known  or understood. It's more than making you feel the things that I feel. It's not about mythology  or mythologizing myself to you. Somehow  through some miraculous synaptic function of the human brain  it's impossible to stutter when you sing. And when I was younger  that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me  singing  so I did it a lot. And that's why I'm here today. Thank you. Singing for me is sweet relief. It is the only time when I feel fluent. It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what I intended. So I know that this is a TED Talk  but now i'm going to TED sing. This is a song that I wrote last year. Thank you very much. Thank you.   I would be a beauty     but my nose     is slightly too big     for my face     And I would be a dreamer     but my dream     is slightly too big     for this space     And I would be an angel     but my halo     it pales in the glow     of your grace     And I would be a joker     but that card looks silly when you play     your ace     I'd like to know     Are there stars in hell      And I'd like to know     know if you can tell     that you make me lose everything I know     That I cannot choose to or not let go     And I'd stay forever     but my home     is slightly too far     from this place     And I swear I tried to     slow it down     when I am walking at your pace     But all I could think     idling through the cities     do I look pretty in the rain      And I don't know how someone     quite so lovely     makes me feel ugly     So much shame     And I'd like to know     Are there stars in hell      And I'd like to know     know if you can tell     that you make me lose everything I know     that I cannot choose to or not let go   Thank you very much.  Applause  As a kid I always loved information that I could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers. I remember  growing up  I'd be frustrated at how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.  Talithia  if I've told you once  I've told you a thousand times.  No dad  you've only told me    times and twice it wasn't my fault.  Laughter  I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics. I always wanted to know  what are people trying to hide with numbers  As a statistician  I want people to show me the data so I can decide for myself. Donald and I were pregnant with our third child and we were at about    and a half weeks  what some of you may refer to as being overdue. Statisticians  we call that being within the    percent confidence interval. And at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby  and this is just routine  it tests whether or not the baby  is feeling any type of undue stress. And you are rarely  if ever  seen by your actual doctor  just whoever happens to be  working at the hospital that day. So we go in for a stress test and after    minutes the doctor comes out and he says   Your baby is under stress  we need to induce you.  Now  as a statistician  what's my response  Show me the data  So then he proceeds to tell us the baby's heart rate trace went from    minutes  the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be my heart rate zone and I said   Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate  I was moving around a little bit  it's hard to lay still on your back     weeks pregnant for    minutes. Maybe it was shifting around.  He said   Well  we don't want to take any chances.  I said okay. I said   What if I was at    weeks with this same data  Would your decision be to induce    Well  no  I would wait until you were at least    weeks  but you are almost     there is no reason to leave that baby inside  let's get you a room.  I said   Well  why don't we just do it again  We can collect more data. I can try to be really still for    minutes. We can average the two and see what that means.  Laughter  And he goes   Ma'am  I just don't want you to have a miscarriage.  That makes three of us. And then he says   Your chances of having a miscarriage double when you go past your due date. Let's get you a room.  Wow. So now as a statistician  what's my response  Show me the data  Dude  you're talking chances  I do chances all day long  tell me all about chances. Let's talk chances.  Laughter  Let's talk chances. So I say   Okay  great. Do I go from a    percent  chance to a    percent chance  Where are we here with this miscarriage thing  And he goes   Not quite  but it doubles  and we really just want what's best for the baby.  Undaunted  I try a different angle. I said   Okay  out of       full term pregnant women  how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date  And then he looks at me and looks at Donald  and he goes  about one in      . I said   Okay  so of those       women  how many are going to miscarry just after their due date    About two.   Laughter  I said   Okay  so you are telling me that my chances go from a  .  percent chance to a  .  percent chance.  Okay  so at this point the data is not convincing us that we need to be induced  and so then we proceed to have a conversation about how inductions lead to a higher rate of Cesarean sections  and if at all  possible we'd like to avoid that. And then I said   And I really don't think my due date is accurate.  And so this really stunned him and he looked sort of puzzled and I said   You may not know this  but pregnancy due dates are calculated assuming that you have a standard    day cycle  and my cycle ranges   sometimes it's     sometimes it's up to      and I have been collecting the data to prove it. And so we ended up leaving the hospital  that day without being induced. We actually had to sign a waiver  to walk out of the hospital. And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors  because even with our first child  we were induced at    weeks  cervical fluid was low. I'm not anti medical intervention. But why were confident to leave that day  Well  we had data that told a different story. We had been collecting data for six years. I had this temperature data  and it told a different story. In fact  we could probably pretty  accurately estimate conception. Yeah  that's a story you want to tell at your kid's wedding reception.  Laughter  I remember like it was yesterday. My temperature was a sizzling   .  degrees as I stared into your father's eyes.  Laughter  Oh  yeah. Twenty two more years  we're telling that story. But we were confident to leave  because we had been collecting data. Now  what does that data look like  Here's a standard chart of a woman's waking body temperature during the course of a cycle. So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle till the beginning of the next. You'll see that the temperature is not random. Clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her cycle. So what's happening here  What is that data telling you  Well  ladies  at the beginning of our cycle  the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature. And at ovulation  your body releases an egg and progesterone takes over  pro gestation. And so your body heats up in anticipation of housing this new little fertilized egg. So why this temperature jump  Well  think about when a bird sits on her eggs. Why is she sitting on them  She wants to keep them warm  protect them and keep them warm. Ladies  this is exactly what our bodies do every month  they heat up in anticipation of keeping a new little life warm. And if nothing happens  if you are not pregnant  then estrogen takes back over and  that cycle starts all over again. But if you do get pregnant  sometimes you actually see another shift in your temperatures and it stays elevated for those whole nine months. That's why you see those pregnant  women just sweating and hot  because their temperatures are high. Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago. We were really very excited about this chart. You'll see the low temperature level and then a shift and for about five days  that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel down the fallopian tube and implant  and then you see those temperatures  start to go up a little bit. And in fact  we had a second temperature shift  confirmed with a pregnancy test  that were indeed pregnant with our first child  very exciting. Until a couple of days later I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow  and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage. Had I not been taking my temperature I really would have just thought  my period was late that month  but we actually had data to show that we had miscarried this baby  and even though this data revealed a really unfortunate event in our lives  it was information that we could then take to our doctor. So if there was a fertility issue or some problem  I had data to show  Look  we got pregnant  our temperature shifted  we somehow lost this baby. What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem  And it's not just about temperatures and it's not just about fertility  we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things. For instance  did you know that taking  your temperature can tell you a lot about the condition of your thyroid  So  your thyroid works a lot like  the thermostat in your house. There is an optimal temperature  that you want in your house  you set your thermostat. When it gets too cold in the house  your thermostat kicks in and says   Hey  we need to blow some heat around.  Or if it gets too hot  your thermostat registers   Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off.  That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body. Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body. If it gets too cold  your thyroid  says   Hey  we need to heat up.  If it gets too hot  your thyroid cools you down. But what happens when your  thyroid is not functioning well  When it doesn't function  then it shows up in your body temperatures  they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic. And so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid. Now  what is it  if you had a thyroid  problem and you went to the doctor  your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood. Fine. But the problem with that test is it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body. So you might have a lot of hormone present  but it might not be actively working to regulate your body temperature. So just by collecting your temperature every day  you get information about the condition of your thyroid. So  what if you don't want to take  your temperature every day  I advocate that you do  but there are tons of other things you could take. You could take your blood pressure   you could take your weight   yeah  who's excited about taking their weight every day   Laughter  Early on in our marriage  Donald had a stuffy nose and he had been taking a slew of medications to try to relieve his stuffy nose  to no avail. And so  that night he comes and  he wakes me up and he says   Honey  I can't breath out of my nose.  And I roll over and I look  and I said    Well  can you breath out of your mouth   And he goes   Yes  but I can't breath out of my nose   And so like any good wife  I rush him to the emergency room at   o'clock in the morning. And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking  you can't die on me now. We just got married  people will think I killed you   Laughter  And so  we get to the emergency  room  and the nurse sees us  and he can't breath out of his nose  and so she brings us to the back and the doctor says   What seems to be the problem   and  he goes   I can't breath out of my nose.  And he said   You can't breath out of your nose  No  but he can breath out of his mouth.  Laughter  He takes a step back and he looks at both of us and he says  Sir  I think I know the problem. You're having a heart attack. I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan for you immediately.  And we are thinking  no  no  no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe  just out of his mouth. No  no  no  no  no. And so we go back and forth with this doctor because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis  and he's like   No really  it'll be fine  just calm down.  And I'm thinking  how do you calm down   But I don't think he's having a heart attack. And so fortunately for us  this  doctor was at the end of the shift. So this new doctor comes in  he sees us clearly distraught  with a husband who can't breath out of his nose.  Laughter  And he starts asking us questions. He says   Well  do you two exercise   We ride our bikes  we go to the gym occasionally. We move around. And he says   What were you doing  just before you came here   I'm thinking  I was sleeping  honestly. But okay  what was Donald doing just before  So Donald goes into this slew  of medications he was taking. He lists   I took this decongestant  and then I took this nasal spray   and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says   Oh  You should never mix this  decongestant with this nasal spray. Clogs you up every time. Here  take this one instead.  He gives us a prescription. We're looking at each other  and I looked at the doctor  and I said   Why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diagnose his condition  but this previous doctor wanted to order an EKG and a CAT scan   And he looks at us and says   Well  when a     pound man walks in the  emergency room and says he can't breath  you assume he's having a heart attack and you ask questions later.  Now  emergency room doctors are  trained to make decisions quickly  but not always accurately. And so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him  maybe we would have gotten a  better diagnosis the first time. I want you to consider the following chart  of systolic blood pressure measurements from October      to July     . You'll see that these measurements start in the prehypertension hypertension zone  but over about the course of a year and a half they move into the normal zone. This is about the heart rate of a healthy    year old. What story is this data telling you  Obviously it's the data from someone who's made a drastic transformation  and fortunately for us  that person  happens to be here today. So that     pound guy that walked  into the emergency room with me is now an even sexier and healthier     pound guy  and that's his blood pressure trace. So over the course of that year and a half Donald's eating changed and our exercise regimen changed  and his heart rate responded  his blood pressure responded to that change that he made in his body. So what's the take home message that I want you to leave with today  By taking ownership of your data just like we've done  just by taking this daily measurements about yourself  you become the expert on your body. You become the authority. It's not hard to do. You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics to be an expert in yourself. You don't have to have a medical degree to be your body's expert. Medical doctors  they're experts on the population  but you are the expert on yourself. And so when two of you come together  when two experts come together  the two of you are able to make a better decision than just your doctor alone. Now that you understand the power of information that you can get through personal data collection  I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand. Yes  get it up. I challenge you to take ownership of your data. And today  I hereby confer upon you a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics with a concentration in time dependent data analysis with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto. And so the next time you are in your doctor's office  as newly inducted statisticians  what should always be your response  Audience  Show me the data   Talithia Williams  I can't hear you  Audience  Show me the data  TW  One more time  Audience  Show me the data  TW  Show me the data. Thank you. You probably don't know me  but I am one of those .   percenters that you hear about and read about  and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat. And tonight  what I would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats  to my people  because it feels like it's time for us all to have a chat. Like most plutocrats  I too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist. I have founded  cofounded or funded over    companies across a range of industries. I was the first non family investor in Amazon.com. I cofounded a company called aQuantive that we sold to Microsoft for  .  billion dollars. My friends and I  we own a bank. I tell you this    Laughter    unbelievable  right  I tell you this to show that my life is like most plutocrats. I have a broad perspective on capitalism and business  and I have been rewarded obscenely for that with a life that most of you all can't even imagine  multiple homes  a yacht  my own plane  etc.  etc.  etc. But let's be honest  I am not the smartest person you've ever met. I am certainly not the hardest working. I was a mediocre student. I'm not technical at all. I can't write a word of code. Truly  my success is the consequence of spectacular luck  of birth  of circumstance and of timing. But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things. One  I have an unusually high tolerance for risk  and the other is I have a good sense  a good intuition about what will happen in the future  and I think that that intuition about the future is the essence of good entrepreneurship. So what do I see in our future today  you ask  I see pitchforks  as in angry mobs with pitchforks  because while people like us plutocrats are living beyond the dreams of avarice  the other    percent of our fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind. In       the top one percent of Americans shared about eight percent of national  income   while the bottom    percent of Americans shared    percent. Thirty years later  today  the top one percent shares over    percent of national  income   while the bottom    percent of Americans share    or   . If the trend continues  the top one percent will share over    percent of national  income  in another    years  while the bottom    percent of Americans will share just six. You see  the problem isn't that we have some inequality. Some inequality is necessary for a high functioning capitalist democracy. The problem is that inequality is at historic highs today and it's getting worse every day. And if wealth  power  and income continue to concentrate at the very tippy top  our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a neo feudalist rentier society like   th century France. That was France before the revolution and the mobs with the pitchforks. So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires and for anyone who lives in a gated bubble world  Wake up. Wake up. It cannot last. Because if we do not do something to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society  the pitchforks will come for us  for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality. It has never happened. There are no examples. You show me a highly unequal society  and I will show you a police state or an uprising. The pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this. It's not a matter of if  it's when. And it will be terrible when they come for everyone  but particularly for people like us plutocrats. I know I must sound like some liberal do gooder. I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong. What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately self defeating. Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks from pitchforks  but it's also terrible for business too. So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford. When Ford famously introduced the    day  which was twice the prevailing wage at the time  he didn't just increase the productivity of his factories  he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made. Ford intuited what we now know is true  that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem and characterized by the same kinds of feedback loops you find in a natural ecosystem  a feedback loop between customers and businesses. Raising wages increases demand  which increases hiring  which in turn increases wages and demand and profits  and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity is precisely what is missing from today's economic recovery. And this is why we need to put behind us the trickle down policies that so dominate both political parties and embrace something I call middle out economics. Middle out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient  linear  mechanistic  that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness  and instead embraces the   st century idea that economies are complex  adaptive  ecosystemic  that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality  that they're not efficient at all but are effective if well managed. This   st century perspective allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work by  efficiently  allocating existing resources. It works by  efficiently  creating new solutions to human problems. The genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary solution finding system. It rewards people for solving other people's problems. The difference between a poor society and a rich society  obviously  is the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens. The sum of the solutions that we have in our society really is our prosperity  and this explains why companies like Google and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple and the entrepreneurs who created those companies have contributed so much to our nation's prosperity. This   st century perspective also makes clear that what we think of as economic growth is best understood as the rate at which we solve problems. But that rate is totally dependent upon how many problem solvers   diverse  able problem solvers   we have  and thus how many of our fellow citizens actively participate  both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions  and as customers who consume them. But this maximizing participation thing doesn't happen by accident. It doesn't happen by itself. It requires effort and investment  which is why all highly prosperous capitalist democracies are characterized by massive investments in the middle class and the infrastructure that they depend on. We plutocrats need to get this trickle down economics thing behind us  this idea that the better we do  the better everyone else will do. It's not true. How could it be  I earn       times the median wage  but I do not buy       times as much stuff  do I  I actually bought two pairs of these pants  what my partner Mike calls my manager pants. I could have bought       pairs  but what would I do with them   Laughter  How many haircuts can I get  How often can I go out to dinner  No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get  we can never drive a great national economy. Only a thriving middle class can do that. There's nothing to be done  my plutocrat friends might say. Henry Ford was in a different time. Maybe we can't do some things. Maybe we can do some things. June           Bloomberg published an article I wrote called  The Capitalist s Case for a     Minimum Wage.  The good people at Forbes magazine  among my biggest admirers  called it  Nick Hanauer's near insane proposal.  And yet  just     days after that article was published  Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle to    dollars an hour  more than double what the prevailing federal   .   rate is. How did this happen  reasonable people might ask. It happened because a group of us reminded the middle class that they are the source of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies. We reminded them that when workers have more money  businesses have more customers  and need more employees. We reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage  taxpayers are relieved of the burden of funding the poverty programs like food stamps and medical assistance and rent assistance that those workers need. We reminded them that low wage workers make terrible taxpayers  and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses  all businesses benefit yet all can compete. Now the orthodox reaction  of course  is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right  Your politician's always echoing that trickle down idea by saying things like   Well  if you raise the price of employment  guess what happens  You get less of it.  Are you sure  Because there's some contravening evidence. Since       the wages of CEOs in our country have gone from about    times the median wage to     times. That's raising the price of employment. And yet  to my knowledge  I have never seen a company outsource its CEO's job  automate their job  export the job to China. In fact  we appear to be employing more CEOs and senior managers than ever before. So too for technology workers and financial services workers  who earn multiples of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them  so clearly you can raise the price of employment and get more of it. I know that most people think that the     minimum wage is this insane  risky economic experiment. We disagree. We believe that the     minimum wage in Seattle is actually the continuation of a logical economic policy. It is allowing our city to kick your city's ass. Because  you see  Washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation. We pay all workers   .    which is almost    percent more than the federal minimum of  .    but crucially      percent more than the federal tipped minimum of  .  . If trickle down thinkers were right  then Washington state should have massive unemployment. Seattle should be sliding into the ocean. And yet  Seattle is the fastest growing big city in the country. Washington state is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation. The restaurant business in Seattle  Booming. Why  Because the fundamental law of capitalism is  when workers have more money  businesses have more customers and need more workers. When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants  that's not bad for the restaurant business. That's good for it  despite what some restaurateurs may tell you. Is it more complicated than I'm making out  Of course it is. There are a lot of dynamics at play. But can we please stop insisting that if low wage workers earn a little bit more  unemployment will skyrocket and the economy will collapse  There is no evidence for it. The most insidious thing about trickle down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer  everyone is better off. It is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer  that will be bad for the economy. This is nonsense. So can we please dispense with this rhetoric that says that rich guys like me and my plutocrat friends made our country  We plutocrats know  even if we don't like to admit it in public  that if we had been born somewhere else  not here in the United States  we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit. It's not that they don't have good entrepreneurs in other places  even very  very poor places. It's just that that's all that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford. So here's an idea for a new kind of economics  a new kind of politics that I call new capitalism. Let's acknowledge that capitalism beats the alternatives  but also that the more people we include  both as entrepreneurs and as customers  the better it works. Let's by all means shrink the size of government  but not by slashing the poverty programs  but by ensuring that workers are paid enough so that they actually don't need those programs. Let's invest enough in the middle class to make our economy fairer and more inclusive  and by fairer  more truly competitive  and by more truly competitive  more able to generate the solutions to human problems that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity. Capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for creating prosperity in human societies  if it is well managed  but capitalism  because of the fundamental multiplicative dynamics of complex systems  tends towards  inexorably  inequality  concentration and collapse. The work of democracies is to maximize the inclusion of the many in order to create prosperity  not to enable the few to accumulate money. Government does create prosperity and growth  by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive. Balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers isn't bad for capitalism. It's essential to it. Programs like a reasonable minimum wage  affordable healthcare  paid sick leave  and the progressive taxation necessary to pay for the important infrastructure necessary for the middle class like education  R and D  these are indispensable tools shrewd capitalists should embrace to drive growth  because no one benefits from it like us. Many economists would have you believe that their field is an objective science. I disagree  and I think that it is equally a tool that humans use to enforce and encode our social and moral preferences and prejudices about status and power  which is why plutocrats like me have always needed to find persuasive stories to tell everyone else about why our relative positions are morally righteous and good for everyone  like  we are indispensable  the job creators  and you are not  like  tax cuts for us create growth  but investments in you will balloon our debt and bankrupt our great country  that we matter  that you don't. For thousands of years  these stories were called divine right. Today  we have trickle down economics. How obviously  transparently self serving all of this is. We plutocrats need to see that the United States of America made us  not the other way around  that a thriving middle class is the source of prosperity in capitalist economies  not a consequence of it. And we should never forget that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit. Fellow plutocrats  I think it may be time for us to recommit to our country  to commit to a new kind of capitalism which is both more inclusive and more effective  a capitalism that will ensure that America's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world. Let's secure the future for ourselves  our children and their children. Or alternatively  we could do nothing  hide in our gated communities and private schools  enjoy our planes and yachts   they're fun   and wait for the pitchforks. Thank you. We're seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy. I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay. We get the people for whom nothing else has worked  people who have fallen through all of the other social safety nets. They can't contain them  so we must. That's our job  contain them  control them. Over the years  as a prison system  as a nation  and as a society  we've become very good at that  but that shouldn't make you happy. Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world. We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in     . We house the parents of almost three million of our community's children  and we've become the new asylum  the largest mental health provider in this nation. When we lock someone up  that is no small thing. And yet  we are called the Department of Corrections. Today I want to talk about changing the way we think about corrections. I believe  and my experience tells me  that when we change the way we think  we create new possibilities  or futures  and prisons need a different future. I've spent my entire career in corrections  over    years. I followed my dad into this field. He was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him. He was strong  steady  disciplined. I was not so much any of those things  and I'm sure that worried him about me. Eventually I decided  if I was going to end up in prison  I'd better end up on the right side of the bars  so I thought I'd check it out  take a tour of the place my dad worked  the McNeil Island Penitentiary. Now this was the early '  s  and prisons weren't quite what you see on TV or in the movies. In many ways  it was worse. I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high. There were eight men to a cell. there were     men in that living unit. And just in case you wondered  they shared one toilet in those small confines. An officer put a key in a lockbox  and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells. Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells. I walked away as fast as I could. Eventually I went back and I started as an officer there. My job was to run one of those cell blocks and to control those hundreds of men. When I went to work at our receptions center  I could actually hear the inmates  roiling from the parking lot  shaking cell doors  yelling  tearing up their cells. Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up  and what you get is chaos. Contain and control   that was our job. One way we learned to do this more effectively was a new type of housing unit called the Intensive Management Unit  IMU  a modern version of a  hole.  We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors with cuff ports so we could restrain them and feed them. Guess what  It got quieter. Disturbances died down in the general population. Places became safer because those inmates who were most violent or disruptive could now be isolated. But isolation isn't good. Deprive people of social contact and they deteriorate. It was hard getting them out of IMU  for them and for us. Even in prison  it's no small thing to lock someone up. My next assignment was to one of the state's deep end prisons where some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed. By then  the industry had advanced a lot  and we had different tools and techniques to manage disruptive behavior. We had beanbag guns and pepper spray and plexiglass shields  flash bangs  emergency response teams. We met violence with force and chaos with chaos. We were pretty good at putting out fires. While I was there  I met two experienced correctional workers who were also researchers  an anthropologist and a sociologist. One day  one of them commented to me and said   You know  you're pretty good at putting out fires. Have you ever thought about how to prevent them   I was patient with them  explaining our brute force approach to making prisons safer. They were patient with me. Out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments. First  we started training our officers in teams rather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy. Instead of four weeks of training  we gave them   . Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model where we paired new staff with veteran staff. They both got better at the work. Second  we added verbal de escalation skills into the training continuum and made it part of the use of force continuum. It was the non force use of force. And then we did something even more radical. We trained the inmates on those same skills. We changed the skill set  reducing violence  not just responding to it. Third  when we expanded our facility   we tried a new type of design. Now the biggest and most controversial component of this design  of course  was the toilet. There were no toilets. Now that might not sound significant to you here today  but at the time  it was huge. No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet. We all thought it was dangerous and crazy. Even eight men to a cell had a toilet. That small detail changed the way we worked. Inmates and staff started interacting more often and openly and developing a rapport. It was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated. The unit was cleaner  quieter  safer and more humane. This was more effective at keeping the peace than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point. Interacting changes the way you behave  both for the officer and the inmate. We changed the environment and we changed the behavior. Now  just in case I hadn't learned this lesson  they assigned me to headquarters next  and that's where I ran straight up against system change. Now  many things work against system change  politics and politicians  bills and laws  courts and lawsuits  internal politics. System change is difficult and slow  and oftentimes it doesn't take you where you want to go. It's no small thing to change a prison system. So what I did do is I reflected on my earlier experiences and I remembered that when we interacted with offenders  the heat went down. When we changed the environment  the behavior changed. And these were not huge system changes. These were small changes  and these changes created new possibilities. So next  I got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison. And at the same time  I was working on my degree at the Evergreen State College. I interacted with a lot of people who were not like me  people who had different ideas and came from different backgrounds. One of them was a rainforest ecologist. She looked at my small prison and what she saw was a laboratory. We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they couldn't complete on their own  like repopulating endangered species  frogs  butterflies  endangered prairie plants. At the same time  we found ways to make our operation more efficient through the addition of solar power  rainwater catchment  organic gardening  recycling. This initiative has led to many projects that have had huge system wide impact  not just in our system  but in  other state systems as well  small experiments making a big difference to science  to the community. The way we think about our work changes our work. The project just made my job more interesting and exciting. I was excited. Staff were excited. Officers were excited. Inmates were excited. They were inspired. Everybody wanted to be part of this. They were making a contribution  a difference  one they thought was meaningful and important. Let me be clear on what's going on here  though. Inmates are highly adaptive. They have to be. Oftentimes  they know more about our own systems than the people who run them. And they're here for a reason. I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them  but I do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison. So that was the question  Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives  and if so  what difference would that make  So I took that question back to the deep end  where some of our most violent offenders are housed. Remember  IMUs are for punishment. You don't get perks there  like programming. That was how we thought. But then we started to realize that if any inmates needed programming  it was these particular inmates. In fact  they needed intensive programming. So we changed our thinking     degrees  and we started looking for new possibilities. What we found was a new kind of chair. Instead of using the chair for punishment  we put it in classrooms. Okay  we didn't forget our responsibility to control  but now inmates could interact safely  face to face with other inmates and staff  and because control was no longer an issue  everybody could focus on other things  like learning. Behavior changed. We changed our thinking  and we changed  what was possible  and this gives me hope. Now  I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work. What I can tell you  though  it is working. Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates  and when our prisons are safe  we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling. Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal  but it's not our only goal. To be honest with you  preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions. If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime  I'm afraid we'll never get there. But prisons can do some things we never thought they could do. Prisons can be the source of innovation and sustainability  repopulating endangered species and environmental restoration. Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers  dog rescuers. Prisons can be the source of meaningful work and opportunity for staff and the inmates who live there. We can contain and control and provide humane environments. These are not opposing qualities. We can't wait    to    years to find out if this is worth doing. Our strategy is not massive system change. Our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months  not years. We need more small pilots where we learn as we go  pilots that change the range of possibility. We need new and better ways to measure impacts on engagement  on interaction  on safe environments. We need more opportunities to participate in and contribute to our communities  your communities. Prisons need to be secure  yes  safe  yes. We can do that. Prisons need to provide humane environments where people can participate  contribute  and learn meaningful lives. We're learning how to do that. That's why I'm hopeful. We don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison. We can define that. We can create that. And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity  prisons can be more than the bucket for failed social policy. Maybe finally  we will earn our title  a department of corrections. Thank you. I'm a teacher and a practitioner of civics in America. Now  I will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep to please wake up.  Laughter  Why is it that the very word  civics  has such a soporific   even a narcoleptic effect on us  I think it's because the very  word signifies something exceedingly virtuous   exceedingly important  and exceedingly boring. Well  I think it's the responsibility of people like us  people who show up for gatherings like this in person or online  in any way we can  to make civics sexy again  as sexy as it was during the American Revolution  as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement. And I believe the way we make civics sexy again is to make explicitly about the teaching of power. The way we do that  I believe  is at the level of the city. This is what I want to talk about today  and I want to start by defining some terms and then I want to describe the scale of the problem I think we face and then suggest the ways that I believe cities can be the seat of the solution. So let me start with some definitions. By civics  I simply mean the art of being a pro social  problem solving contributor in a self governing community. Civics is the art of citizenship  what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply showing up for life  and it encompasses three things  a foundation of values  an understanding of the systems that make the world go round  and a set of skills that allow you to pursue goals and to have others join in that pursuit. And that brings me to my definition of power  which is simply this  the capacity to make others do what you would have them do. It sounds menacing  doesn't it  We don't like to talk about power. We find it scary. We find it somehow evil. We feel uncomfortable naming it. In the culture and mythology of democracy  power resides with the people. Period. End of story. Any further inquiry not necessary and not really that welcome. Power has a negative moral valence. It sounds Machiavellian inherently. It seems inherently evil. But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil than fire or physics. It just is. And power governs how any form of government operates  whether a democracy or a dictatorship. And the problem we face today  here in America in particular  but all around the world  is that far too many people  are profoundly illiterate in power   what it is  who has it  how it operates  how it flows  what part of it is visible   what part of it is not  why some people have it   why that's compounded. And as a result of this illiteracy  those few who do understand how power operates in civic life  those who understand how a bill becomes a law  yes  but also how a friendship  becomes a subsidy  or how a bias becomes a policy  or how a slogan becomes a movement  the people who understand those things wield disproportionate influence  and they're perfectly happy to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance of the great majority. This is why it is so fundamental for us right now to grab hold of this idea of power and to democratize it. One of the things that is so profoundly exciting and challenging about this moment is that as a result of this power illiteracy that is so pervasive  there is a concentration of knowledge  of understanding  of clout. I mean  think about it  How does a friendship become a subsidy  Seamlessly  when a senior government official decides to leave government and become a lobbyist for a private interest and convert his or her relationships into capital for their new masters. How does a bias become a policy  Insidiously  just the way that stop and frisk  for instance  became over time a bureaucratic numbers game. How does a slogan become a movement  Virally  in the way that the Tea Party  for instance  was able to take the  Don't Tread on Me  flag from the American Revolution  or how  on the other side  a band of activists could take a magazine headline   Occupy Wall Street   and turn that into a global meme and movement. The thing is  though  most people aren't looking for and don't want to see these realities. So much of this ignorance  this civic illiteracy  is willful. There are some millennials  for instance  who think the whole business is just sordid. They don't want to have anything to do with politics. They'd rather just opt out and engage in volunteerism. There are some techies out there who believe that the cure all for any power imbalance or power abuse is simply more data  more transparency. There are some on the left who think power resides only with corporations  and some on the right who think power resides only with government  each side blinded by their selective outrage. There are the naive who believe that good things just happen and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen  the fortunate and unfortunate alike who think that their lot is simply what they deserve rather than the eminently alterable result of a prior arrangement  an inherited allocation  of power. As a result of all of this creeping fatalism in public life  we here  particularly in America today  have depressingly low levels of civic knowledge  civic engagement  participation  awareness. The whole business of politics has been effectively subcontracted out to a band of professionals  money people  outreach people  message people  research people. The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs in the sense of suckers. We become demotivated to learn more about how things work. We begin to opt out. Well  this problem  this challenge  is a thing that we must now confront  and I believe that when you have this kind of disengagement  this willful ignorance  it becomes both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity of wealth and clout that I was describing a moment ago  this profound civic inequality. This is why it is so important in our time right now to reimagine civics as the teaching of power. Perhaps it's never been more important at any time in our lifetimes. If people don't learn power  people don't wake up  and if they don't wake up  they get left out. Now  part of the art of practicing power means being awake and having a voice  but it also is about having an arena where you can plausibly practice deciding. All of civics boils down to the simple question of who decides  and you have to play that out in a place  in an arena. And this brings me to the third point that I want to make today  which is simply that there is no better arena in our time for the practicing of power than the city. Think about the city where you live  where you're from. Think about a problem in the common life of your city. It can be something small  like where a street lamp should go  or something medium like which library should have its hours extended or cut  or maybe something bigger  like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be turned into a highway or a greenway  or whether all the businesses in your town should be required to pay a living wage. Think about the change that you want in your city  and then think about how you would get it  how you would make it happen. Take an inventory of all the forms of power that are at play in your city's situation  money  of course  people  yes  ideas  information  misinformation  the threat of force  the force of norms. All of these form of power are at play. Now think about how you would activate or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power. This is not some Game of Thrones empire level set of questions. These are questions that play out in every single place on the planet. I'll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines. In Boulder  Colorado  voters not too long ago approved a process to replace the private power company  literally the power company  the electric company Xcel  with a publicly owned utility that would forego profits and attend far more to climate change. Well  Xcel fought back  and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure that would undermine or undo this municipalization. And so the citizen activists in Boulder who have been pushing this now literally have to fight the power in order to fight for power. In Tuscaloosa  at the University of Alabama  there's an organization on campus called  kind of menacingly  the Machine  and it draws from largely white sororities and fraternities on campus  and for decades  the Machine has dominated student government elections. Well now  recently  the Machine has started to get involved in actual city politics  and they've engineered the election of a former Machine member  a young  pro business recent graduate to the Tuscaloosa city school board. Now  as I say  these are just two examples drawn almost at random from the headlines. Every day  there are thousands more like them. And you may like or dislike the efforts I'm describing here in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa  but you cannot help but admire the power literacy of the players involved  their skill. You cannot help but reckon with and recognize the command they have of the elemental questions of civic power   what objective  what strategy  what tactics  what is the terrain  who are your enemies  who are your allies  Now I want you to return to thinking about that problem or that opportunity or that challenge in your city  and the thing it was that you want to fix or create in your city  and ask yourself  do you have command of these elemental questions of power  Could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know  This is the challenge and the opportunity for us. We live in a time right now where in spite of globalization or perhaps because of globalization  all citizenship is ever more resonantly  powerfully local. Indeed  power in our time is flowing ever faster to the city. Here in the United States  the national government has tied itself up in partisan knots. Civic imagination and innovation and creativity are emerging from local ecosystems now and radiating outward  and this great innovation  this great wave of localism that's now arriving  and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live their everyday lives  this isn't some precious parochialism  this isn't some retreat into insularity  no. This is emergent. The localism of our time is networked powerfully. And so  for instance  consider the ways that strategies for making cities more bike friendly have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle. Think about how experiments in participatory budgeting  where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation of city funds. Those experiments have spread from Porto Alegre  Brazil to here in New York City   to the wards of Chicago. Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles and many cities between are now organizing to stage strikes to remind the people who live in their cities what a day without immigrants would look like. In China  all across that country  members of the New Citizens' Movement are beginning to activate and organize to fight official corruption and graft  and they're drawing the ire of officials there  but they're also drawing the attention of anti corruption activists all around the world. In Seattle  where I'm from  we've become part of a great global array of cities that are now working together bypassing government altogether  national government altogether  in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals of the Kyoto Protocol. All of these citizens  united  are forming a web  a great archipelago of power that allows us to bypass brokenness and monopolies of control. And our task now is to accelerate this work. Our task now is to bring more and more people into the fold of this work. That's why my organization  Citizen University  has undertaken a project now to create an everyman's curriculum in civic power. And this curriculum starts with this triad that I described earlier of values  systems and skills. And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you to help create this curriculum with the stories and the experiences and the challenges that each of you lives and faces  to create something powerfully collective. And I want to invite you in particular to try a simple exercise drawn from the early frameworks of this curriculum. I want you to write a narrative  a narrative from the future of your city  and you can date it  set it out one year from now  five years from now  a decade from now  a generation from now  and write it as a case study looking back  looking back at the change that you wanted in your city  looking back at the cause that you were championing  and describing the ways that that change and that cause came  in fact  to succeed. Describe the values of your fellow citizens that you activated  and the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir. Recount all the different ways that you engaged the systems of government  of the marketplace  of social institutions  of faith organizations  of the media. Catalog all the skills you had to deploy  how to negotiate  how to advocate  how to frame issues  how to navigate diversity in conflict  all those skills that enabled you to bring folks on board and to overcome resistance. What you'll be doing when you write that narrative is you'll be discovering how to read power  and in the process  how to write power. So share what you write  do you what you write  and then share what you do. I invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our Facebook page for Citizen University. But even beyond that  it's in the conversations that we have today all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings that are happening on this topic at this moment  and to think about how we can become one another's teachers and students in power. If we do that  then together we can make civics sexy again. Together  we can democratize democracy and make it safe again for amateurs. Together  we can create a great network of city that will be the most powerful collective laboratory for self government this planet has ever seen. We have the power to do that. Thank you very much. Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr.  in a      speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement  states   In the end  we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.  As a teacher  I've internalized this message. Every day  all around us  we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination  violence  genocide and war. In the classroom  I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry. We work together to fill those spaces  to recognize them  to name them  to understand that they don't have to be sources of shame. In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences  I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class  which every student signs at the beginning of the year  read critically  write consciously  speak clearly  tell your truth. And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point  tell your truth. And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up  I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so. So I tell them that growing up  as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans  during Lent I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up  sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you understand his sanctity. I've given up soda  McDonald's  French fries  French kisses  and everything in between. But one year  I gave up speaking. I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice  but it was like I hadn't realized that I had given that up a long time ago. I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to  told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still had to figure out being my own  so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything  appeasing ignorance with my silence  unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence. When Christian was beat up for being gay  I put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head down as if I didn't even notice. I couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I had put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing. I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one. When the woman at the fundraising gala said  I'm so proud of you. It must be so hard teaching those poor  unintelligent kids   I bit my lip  because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity. We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't. Silence is the residue of fear. It is feeling your flaws gut wrench guillotine your tongue. It is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs. Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina. It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left. It is the sound after the noose is already tied. It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain. There is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you. I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision. I will tell Christian that he is a lion  a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance. I will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was  because sometimes all people want to be is human. I will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau  and just because you watched one episode of  The Wire  doesn't mean you know anything about my kids. So this year  instead of giving something up  I will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue  a stage on the underside of my inhibition. Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've ever needed is your voice  Thank you. TED is   . The world wide web is celebrating this month its   th anniversary. So I've got a question for you. Let's talk about the journey  mainly about the future. Let's talk about the state. Let's talk about what sort of a web we want. So    years ago  then  I was working at CERN. I got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project. I wrote the code. I was I suppose the first user. There was a lot of concern that people didn't want to pick it up because it would be too complicated. A lot of persuasion  a lot of wonderful collaboration with other people  and bit by bit  it worked. It took off. It was pretty cool. And in fact  a few years later in       five percent of the world population were using the world wide web. In       seven years later     percent. In       we formed the World Wide Web Foundation partly to look at that and worry about that figure. And now here we are in       and    percent of the world are using the world wide web  and counting. Obviously it's increasing. I want you to think about both sides of that. Okay  obviously to anybody here at TED  the first question you ask is  what can we do to get the other    percent on board as quickly as possible  Lots of important things. Obviously it's going to be around mobile. But also  I want you to think about the    percent  because if you're sitting there yourself sort of with a web enabled life  you don't remember things anymore  you just look them up  then you may feel that it's been a success and we can all sit back. But in fact  yeah  it's been a success  there's lots of things  Khan Academy for crying out loud  there's Wikipedia  there's a huge number of free e books that you can read online  lots of wonderful things for education  things in many areas. Online commerce has in some cases completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether  made types of commerce available which weren't available at all before. Commerce has been almost universally affected. Government  not universally affected  but very affected  and on a good day  lots of open data  lots of e government  so lots of things which are visible happening on the web. Also  lots of things which are less visible. The healthcare  late at night when they're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have  when they just talk across the Internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country. Those sorts of things are not  they're not out there  and in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy. So we cannot assume that part of the web  part of the deal with the web  is when I use the web  it's just a transparent  neutral medium. I can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening  without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data. So in fact  something we realized  we can't just use the web  we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing  is it in fact of a quality that we need  We revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech. We can tweet  and oh  lots and lots of people can see our tweets  except when they can't  except when actually Twitter is blocked from their country  or in some way the way we try to express ourselves has put some information about the state of ourselves  the state of the country we live in  which isn't available to anybody else. So we must protest and make sure that censorship is cut down  that the web is opened up where there is censorship. We love the fact that the web is open. It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody. It doesn't matter who we are. And then we join these big social networking companies which are in fact effectively built as silos  so that it's much easier to talk to somebody in the same social network than it is to talk to somebody in a different one  so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves. And we also have  if you've read the book about the filter bubble  the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like. So we love it when we're bathed in what things we like to click on  and so the machine automatically feeds us the stuff that we like and we end up with this rose colored spectacles view of the world called a filter bubble. So here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have. What sort of web do you want  I want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces  as some countries have been suggesting they should do in reaction to recent surveillance. I want a web which has got  for example  is a really good basis for democracy. I want a web where I can use healthcare with privacy and where there's a lot of health data  clinical data is available to scientists to do research. I want a web where the other    percent get on board as fast as possible. I want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation that when something nasty happens  some disaster strikes  that we can respond by building stuff to respond to it very quickly. So this is just some of the things that I want  from a big list  obviously it's longer. You have your list. I want us to use this   th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want. You can go to webat  .org and find some links. There are lots of sites where people have started to put together a Magna Carta  a bill of rights for the web. How about we do that  How about we decide  these are  in a way  becoming fundamental rights  the right to communicate with whom I want. What would be on your list for that Magna Carta  Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta for the web. Let's do that this year. Let's use the energy from the   th anniversary to crowdsource a Magna Carta to the web.  Applause  Thank you. And do me a favor  will you  Fight for it for me. Okay  Thanks. I would like to share with you today a project that has changed how I approach and practice architecture  the Fez River Rehabilitation Project. My hometown of Fez  Morocco  boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world  called the medina  nestled in a river valley. The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the     s  as the population of the medina grew  basic urban infrastructure such as green open spaces and sewage quickly changed and got highly stressed. One of the biggest casualties of the situation was the Fez River  which bisects the medina in its middle and has been considered for many centuries as the city's very soul. In fact  one can witness the presence of the river's extensive water network all throughout the city  in places such as private and public fountains. Unfortunately  because of the pollution of the river  it has been covered little by little by concrete slabs since     . This process of erasure was coupled with the destruction of many houses along the river banks to be able to make machineries enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina. Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards. Actually  the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy. Then pollution takes its toll  mainly due to untreated sewage and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning. At some point  I couldn't bear the desecration of the river  such an important part of my city  and I decided to take action  especially after I heard that the city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it. With clean water  suddenly the uncovering of the river became possible  and with luck and actually a lot of pushing  my partner Takako Tajima and I were commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers to uncover the river. However  we were sneaky  and we proposed more  to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways  and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric  and finally to convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the Medina of Fez. I will show you briefly now two of these public spaces. The first one is the Rcif Plaza  which sits actually right on top of the river  which you can see here in dotted lines. This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that actually compromised the urban integrity of the medina  that has the largest pedestrian network in the world. And right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here  right next to the plaza  you can see that the river looked like a river of trash. Instead  what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian  to cover it with recycled leather canopies  and to connect it to the banks of the river. The second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks  and it used to be an illegal parking  and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina. The playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but also retains it when floods occur. As the project progressed and received several design awards  new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals and design. The only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us to do something very unusual that usually architects don't do. It was for us to take our design ego and our sense of authorship and put it in the backseat and to focus mainly on being activists and on trying to coalesce all of the agendas of stakeholders and focus on the main goals of the project  that is  to uncover the river  treat its water  and provide public spaces for all. We were actually very lucky  and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening. Like  you can see here in the Rcif Plaza. This is how it looked like about six years ago. This is how it looks like today. It's still under construction  but actually it is heavily used by the local population. And finally  this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like when the project is completed. This is the river  covered  used as a trash yard. Then after many years of work  the river with clean water  uncovered. And finally  you can see here the river when the project will be completed. So for sure  the Fez River Rehabilitation will keep on changing and adapting to the sociopolitical landscape of the city  but we strongly believe that by reimagining the role and the agency of the architect  we have set up the core idea of the project into motion  that is  to transform the river from sewage to public space for all  thereby making sure that the city of Fez will remain a living city for its inhabitants rather than a mummified heritage. Thank you very much. When my first children's book was published in       I returned to my old elementary school to talk to the students about being an author and an illustrator  and when I was setting up my slide projector in the cafetorium  I looked across the room  and there she was  my old lunch lady. She was still there at the school and she was busily preparing lunches for the day. So I approached her to say hello  and I said   Hi  Jeannie  How are you   And she looked at me  and I could tell that she recognized me  but she couldn't quite place me  and she looked at me and she said   Stephen Krosoczka   And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka  but Stephen is my uncle who is    years older than I am  and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid. And she started telling me about her grandkids  and that blew my mind. My lunch lady had grandkids  and therefore kids  and therefore left school at the end of the day  I thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons. I had never thought about any of that before. Well  that chance encounter inspired my imagination  and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series  a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes  a school bus monster  and mutant mathletes  and the end of every book  they get the bad guy with their hairnet  and they proclaim   Justice is served   And it's been amazing  because the series was so welcomed into the reading lives of children  and they sent me the most amazing letters and cards and artwork. And I would notice as I would visit schools  the lunch staff would be involved in the programming in a very meaningful way. And coast to coast  all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing   Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness.  Because the lunch lady has not been treated very kindly in popular culture over time. But it meant the most to Jeannie. When the books were first published  I invited her to the book launch party  and in front of everyone there  everyone she had fed over the years  I gave her a piece of artwork and some books. And two years after this photo was taken  she passed away  and I attended her wake  and nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there  because next to her casket was this painting  and her husband told me it meant so much to her that I had acknowledged her hard work  I had validated what she did. And that inspired me to create a day where we could recreate that feeling in cafeterias across the country  School Lunch Hero Day  a day where kids can make creative projects for their lunch staff. And I partnered with the School Nutrition Association  and did you know that a little over    million kids participate in school lunch programs every day. That equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year. And the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray. There is Ms. Brenda in California  who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss. There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky who realized that    percent of their students relied on those meals every day  and they were going without food over the summer  so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit  and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings     kids a day during the summer. And kids made the most amazing projects. I knew they would. Kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper. They took photos of their lunch lady's head and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady and fixed that to a milk carton and presented them with flowers. And they made their own comics  starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies. And they made thank you pizzas  where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza. For me  I was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies  because one woman said to me  she said   Before this day  I felt like I was at the end of the planet at this school. I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here.  Another woman said to me   You know  what I got out of this is that what I do is important.  And of course what she does is important. What they all do is important. They're feeding our children every single day  and before a child can learn  their belly needs to be full  and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society. So I hope that you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day to say thank you to your lunch staff  and I hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be. A thank you can change a life. It changes the life of the person who receives it  and it changes the life of the person who expresses it. Thank you. Oliver was an extremely dashing  handsome  charming and largely unstable male that I completely lost my heart to. He was a Bernese mountain dog  and my ex husband and I adopted him  and about six months in  we realized that he was a mess. He had such paralyzing separation anxiety that we couldn't leave him alone. Once  he jumped out of our third floor apartment. He ate fabric. He ate things  recyclables. He hunted flies that didn't exist. He suffered from hallucinations. He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder and that's really just the tip of the iceberg. But like with humans  sometimes it's six months in before you realize that the person that you love has some issues. And most of us do not take the person we're dating back to the bar where we met them or give them back to the friend that introduced us  or sign them back up on Match.com. We love them anyway  and we stick to it  and that is what I did with my dog. And I was a   I'd studied biology. I have a Ph.D. in history of science from MIT  and had you asked me    years ago if a dog I loved  or just dogs generally  had emotions  I would have said yes  but I'm not sure that I would have told you that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder  a Prozac prescription and a therapist. But then  I fell in love  and I realized that they can  and actually trying to help my own dog overcome his panic and his anxiety  it just changed my life. It cracked open my world. And I spent the last seven years  actually  looking into this topic of mental illness in other animals. Can they be mentally ill like people  and if so  what does it mean about us  And what I discovered is that I do believe they can suffer from mental illness  and actually looking and trying to identify mental illness in them often helps us be better friends to them and also can help us better understand ourselves. So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute. Many of us think that we can't know what another animal is thinking  and that is true  but any of you in relationships   at least this is my case   just because you ask someone that you're with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn't mean that they can tell you. They may not have words to explain what it is that they're feeling  and they may not know. It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress. Before the early   th century  physicians often diagnosed emotional distress in their patients just by observation. It also turns out that thinking about mental illness in other animals isn't actually that much of a stretch. Most mental disorders in the United States are fear and anxiety disorders  and when you think about it  fear and anxiety are actually really extremely helpful animal emotions. Usually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous  and once we feel them  we then are motivated to move away from whatever is dangerous. The problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don't call for it. Mood disorders  too  may actually just be the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal  and obsessive compulsive disorders also are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing which is keeping yourself clean and groomed. This tips into the territory of mental illness when you do things like compulsively over wash your hands or paws  or you develop a ritual that's so extreme that you can't sit down to a bowl of food unless you engage in that ritual. So for humans  we have the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual   which is basically an atlas of the currently agreed upon mental disorders. In other animals  we have YouTube. This is just one search I did for  OCD dog  but I encourage all of you to look at  OCD cat.  You will be shocked by what you see. I'm going to show you just a couple examples. This is an example of shadow chasing. I know  and it's funny and in some ways it's cute. The issue  though  is that dogs can develop compulsions like this that they then engage in all day. So they won't go for a walk  they won't hang out with their friends  they won't eat. They'll develop fixations like chasing their tails compulsively. Here's an example of a cat named Gizmo. He looks like he's on a stakeout but he does this for many  many  many hours a day. He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw at the screen. This is another example of what's considered a stereotypic behavior. This is a sun bear at the Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting. And if you just sort of happened upon this scene  you might think that Ting Ting is just playing with a stick  but Ting Ting does this all day  and if you pay close attention and if I showed you guys the full half hour of this clip  you'd see that he does the exact same thing in the exact same order  and he spins the stick in the exact same way every time. Other super common behaviors that you may see  particularly in captive animals  are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies  and actually  humans do this too  and in us  we'll sway  we'll move from side to side. Many of us do this  and sometimes it's an effort to soothe ourselves  and I think in other animals that is often the case too. But it's not just stereotypic behaviors that other animals engage in. This is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston. She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist  and she's been treated for a mood disorder among other things. Many animals develop mood disorders. Lots of creatures   this horse is just one example   develop self destructive behaviors. They'll gnaw on things or do other things that may also soothe them  even if they're self destructive  which could be considered similar to the ways that some humans cut themselves. Plucking. Turns out  if you have fur or feathers or skin  you can pluck yourself compulsively  and some parrots actually have been studied to better understand trichotillomania  or compulsive plucking in humans  something that affects    million Americans right now. Lab rats pluck themselves too. In them  it's called barbering. Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan are coming back with what's considered canine PTSD  and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life when they come back from deployments. They can be too scared to approach men with beards or to hop into cars. I want to be careful and be clear  though. I do not think that canine PTSD is the same as human PTSD. But I also do not think that my PTSD is like your PTSD  or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours. We are all different. We also all have very different susceptibilities. So two dogs  raised in the same household  exposed to the very same things  one may develop  say  a debilitating fear of motorcycles  or a phobia of the beep of the microwave  and another one is going to be just fine. So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently  Is this just an instance of humans driving other animals crazy  Or  is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse  And it turns out we're actually so much more complicated than that. So one great thing that has happened to me is recently I published a book on this  and every day now that I open my email or when I go to a reading or even when I go to a cocktail party  people tell me their stories of the animals that they have met. And recently  I did a reading in California  and a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said   Dr. Braitman  I think my cat has PTSD.  And I said   Well  why  Tell me a little bit about it.  So  Ping is her cat. She was a rescue  and she used to live with an elderly man  and one day the man was vacuuming and he suffered a heart attack  and he died. A week later  Ping was discovered in the apartment alongside the body of her owner  and the vacuum had been running the entire time. For many months  up to I think two years after that incident  she was so scared she couldn't be in the house when anyone was cleaning. She was quite literally a scaredy cat. She would hide in the closet. She was un self confident and shaky  but with the loving support of her family  a lot of a time  and their patience  now  three years later  she's actually a happy  confident cat. Another story of trauma and recovery that I came across was actually a few years ago. I was in Thailand to do some research. I met a monkey named Boonlua  and when Boonlua was a baby  he was attacked by a pack of dogs  and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm  and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery  where the monks took him in. They called in a veterinarian  who treated his wounds. Eventually  Boonlua wound up at an elephant facility  and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing  and they figured out what he liked  which  it turned out  was mint Mentos and Rhinoceros beetles and eggs. But they worried  because he was social  that he was lonely  and they didn't want to put him in with another monkey  because they thought with just one arm  he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play. And so they gave him a rabbit  and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey. He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit. They groomed each other  they become close friends  and then the rabbit had bunnies  and Boonlua was even happier than he was before  and it had in a way given him a reason to wake up in the morning  and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up that he decided not to sleep. He became extremely protective of these bunnies  and he stopped sleeping  and he would sort of nod off while trying to take care of them. In fact  he was so protective and so affectionate with these babies that the sanctuary eventually had to take them away from him because he was so protective  he was worried that their mother might hurt them. So after they were taken away  the sanctuary staff worried that he would fall into a depression  and so to avoid that  they gave him another rabbit friend. My official opinion is that he does not look depressed. So one thing that I would really like people to feel is that you really should feel empowered to make some assumptions about the creatures that you know well. So when it comes to your dog or your cat or maybe your one armed monkey that you happen to know  if you think that they are traumatized or depressed  you're probably right. This is extremely anthropomorphic  or the assignation of human characteristics onto non human animals or things. I don't think  though  that that's a problem. I don't think that we can not anthropomorphize. It's not as if you can take your human brain out of your head and put it in a jar and then use it to think about another animal thinking. We will always be one animal wondering about the emotional experience of another animal. So then the choice becomes  how do you anthropomorphize well  Or do you anthropomorphize poorly  And anthropomorphizing poorly is all too common. It may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding  or getting too close to exotic wildlife because you believe that you had a spiritual connection. There's all manner of things. Anthropomorphizing well  however  I believe is based on accepting our animal similarities with other species and using them to make assumptions that are informed about other  animals' minds and experiences  and there's actually an entire industry that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well  and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry. One in five Americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug  from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications to the antipsychotics. It turns out that we owe this entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal to other animals. These drugs were tested in non human animals first  and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects. The very popular antipsychotic Thorazine first relaxed rats before it relaxed people. The antianxiety medication Librium was given to cats selected for their meanness in the     s and made them into peaceable felines. And even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits. Today  however  we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects  but they're giving them these drugs as patients  both in ethical and much less ethical ways. SeaWorld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications when their calves are taken away. Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics and antianxiety medications. But dogs like my own Oliver are given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications to keep them from jumping out of buildings or jumping into traffic. Just recently  actually  a study came out in  Science  that showed that even crawdads responded to antianxiety medication. It made them braver  less skittish  and more likely to explore their environment. It's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs  but I can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry is immense and growing  from seven billion dollars in      to a projected  .   billion by the year     . Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely. Others  like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee at the zoo there was on them until he started to save his Paxil prescription and then distribute it among the other bonobos. More than psychopharmaceuticals  though  there are many  many  many other therapeutic interventions that help other creatures. And here is a place where I think actually that veterinary medicine can teach something to human medicine  which is  if you take your dog  who is  say  compulsively chasing his tail  into the veterinary behaviorist  their first action isn't to reach for the prescription pad  it's to ask you about your dog's life. They want to know how often your dog gets outside. They want to know how much exercise your dog is getting. They want to know how much social time with other dogs and other humans. They want to talk to you about what sorts of therapies  largely behavior therapies  you've tried with that animal. Those are the things that often tend to help the most  especially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals. The thing  though  I believe  that helps the most  particularly with social animals  is time with other social animals. In many ways  I feel like I became a service animal to my own dog  and I have seen parrots do it for people and people do it for parrots and dogs do it for elephants and elephants do it for other elephants. I don't know about you  I get a lot of Internet forwards of unlikely animal friendships. I also think it's a huge part of Facebook  the monkey that adopts the cat or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn  or the cow that makes friends with the pig  and had you asked me eight  nine years ago  about these  I would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way and maybe even staged  and what I can tell you now is that there is actually something to this. This is legit. In fact  some interesting studies have pointed to oxytocin levels  which are a kind of bonding hormone that we release when we're having sex or nursing or around someone that we care for extremely  oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs who care about each other or who enjoy each other's company  and beyond that  other studies show that oxytocin raised even in other pairs of animals  so  say  in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other  their levels spiked afterwards. I have a friend who really showed me that mental health is in fact a two way street. His name is Lonnie Hodge  and he's a veteran of Vietnam. When he returned  he started working with survivors of genocide and a lot of people who had gone through war trauma. And he had PTSD and also a fear of heights  because in Vietnam  he had been rappelling backwards out of helicopters over the skids  and he was givena service dog named Gander  a labradoodle  to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights. This is them actually on the first day that they met  which is amazing  and since then  they've spent a lot of time together visiting with other veterans suffering from similar issues. But what's so interesting to me about Lonnie and Gander's relationship is about a few months in  Gander actually developed a fear of heights  probably because he was watching Lonnie so closely. What's pretty great about this  though  is that he's still a fantastic service dog  because now  when they're both at a great height  Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well being that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself. Since I've spent so much time with these stories  digging into archives  I literally spent years doing this research  and it's changed me. I no longer look at animals at the species level. I look at them as individuals  and I think about them as creatures with their own individual weather systems guiding their behavior and informing how they respond to the world. And I really believe that this has made me a more curious and a more empathetic person  both to the animals that share my bed and occasionally wind up on my plate  but also to the people that I know who are suffering from anxiety and from phobias and all manner of other things  and I really do believe that even though you can't know exactly what's going on in the mind of a pig or your pug or your partner  that that shouldn't stop you from empathizing with them. The best thing that we could do for our loved ones is  perhaps  to anthropomorphize them. Charles Darwin's father once told him that everybody could lose their mind at some point. Thankfully  we can often find them again  but only with each other's help. Thank you. These are simple objects  clocks  keys  combs  glasses. They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey. We are all familiar with these mundane  everyday objects. The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them. Usually  they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war. These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland  and as we speak  forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves     years after the war. And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered. During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '  s  approximately        citizens  mainly civilians  went missing  presumed killed  and another         were killed during combat operations. Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities  when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army. The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide. Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial  political  religious or ethnic group. As much as genocide is about killing. It is also about destroying their property  their cultural heritage  and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed. Genocide is not only about the killing  it is about the denied identity. There are always traces   no such thing as a perfect crime. There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them. These items are recovered from numerous mass graves  and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings  the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust. Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified. Once recovered  these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned  analyzed  catalogued and stored. Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI. These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims  but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials. Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically  but physical browsing is extremely difficult  an ineffective and painful process. Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects  they become orphans of the narrative. Many of them get destroyed  believe it or not  or they get simply shelved  out of sight and out of mind. I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse. As a storyteller  I like to give back to the community. I like to move beyond raising awareness. And in this case  someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent  unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened. Photography is about empathy  and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy. In this case  I am merely a tool  a forensic  if you like  and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document. Once all the missing persons are identified  only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain. In all their simplicity  these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims  the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed. Thank you very much. Ten years ago  I wrote a book which I entitled  Our Final Century   Question mark. My publishers cut out the question mark.  Laughter  The American publishers changed our title to  Our Final Hour.  Americans like instant gratification and the reverse. And my theme was this  Our Earth has existed for    million centuries  but this one is special   it's the first where one species  ours  has the planet's future in its hands. Over nearly all of Earth's history  threats have come from nature   disease  earthquakes  asteroids and so forth   but from now on  the worst dangers come from us. And it's now not just the nuclear threat  in our interconnected world  network breakdowns can cascade globally  air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days  and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light. We fret too much about minor hazards   improbable air crashes  carcinogens in food  low radiation doses  and so forth   but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios. The worst have thankfully not yet happened. Indeed  they probably won't. But if an event is potentially devastating  it's worth paying a substantial premium to safeguard against it  even if it's unlikely  just as we take out fire insurance on our house. And as science offers greater power and promise  the downside gets scarier too. We get ever more vulnerable. Within a few decades  millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech  just as they misuse cybertech today. Freeman Dyson  in a TED Talk  foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets. Well  this may be on the science fiction fringe  but were even part of his scenario to come about  our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed. For instance  there are some eco extremists who think that it would be better for the planet  for Gaia  if there were far fewer humans. What happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by       And by then  other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality  dumb robots going rogue  or a network that develops a mind of its own threatens us all. Well  can we guard against such risks by regulation  We must surely try  but these enterprises are so competitive  so globalized  and so driven by commercial pressure  that anything that can be done will be done somewhere  whatever the regulations say. It's like the drug laws   we try to regulate  but can't. And the global village will have its village idiots  and they'll have a global range. So as I said in my book  we'll have a bumpy ride through this century. There may be setbacks to our society   indeed  a    percent chance of a severe setback. But are there conceivable events that could be even worse  events that could snuff out all life  When a new particle accelerator came online  some people anxiously asked  could it destroy the Earth or  even worse  rip apart the fabric of space  Well luckily  reassurance could be offered. I and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times already  via cosmic ray collisions. But scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world. Biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens. And by the way  our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question  and it's this  Consider two scenarios. Scenario A wipes out    percent of humanity. Scenario B wipes out     percent. How much worse is B than A  Some would say    percent worse. The body count is    percent higher. But I claim that B is incomparably worse. As an astronomer  I can't believe that humans are the end of the story. It is five billion years before the sun flares up  and the universe may go on forever  so post human evolution  here on Earth and far beyond  could be as prolonged as the Darwinian process that's led to us  and even more wonderful. And indeed  future evolution will happen much faster  on a technological timescale  not a natural selection timescale. So we surely  in view of those immense stakes  shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential. Some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction  but others may be disquietingly real. It's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable  and in fact  that's why we at Cambridge University are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks. It seems it's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters. And we need all the help we can get from others  because we are stewards of a precious pale blue dot in a vast cosmos  a planet with    million centuries ahead of it. And so let's not jeopardize that future. And I'd like to finish with a quote from a great scientist called Peter Medawar. I quote   The bells that toll for mankind are like the bells of Alpine cattle. They are attached to our own necks  and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound.  Thank you very much. In Kenya       is known as the year of the cup  or the goro goro. The goro goro is a cup used to measure two kilograms of maize flower on the market  and the maize flower is used to make ugali  a polenta like cake that is eaten together with vegetables. Both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most Kenyan farms  which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm. One goro goro can feed three meals for an average family  and in       the whole harvest could fit in one goro goro. It was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory. Now today  I insure farmers against droughts like those in the year of the cup  or to be more specific  I insure the rains. I come from a family of missionaries who built hospitals in Indonesia  and my father built a psychiatric hospital in Tanzania. This is me  age five  in front of that hospital. I don't think they thought I'd grow up to sell insurance.  Laughter  So let me tell you how that happened. In       I was working for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda  and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister. She launched an ambitious plan to start a green revolution in her country  and before we knew it  we were importing tons of fertilizer and seed and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer and plant. A couple of weeks later  the International Monetary Fund visited us  and asked my minister   Minister  it's great that you want to help farmers reach food security  but what if it doesn't rain   My minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly   I am going to pray for rain.  That ended the discussion. On the way back to the ministry in the car  she turned around to me and said   Rose  you've always been interested in finance. Go find us some insurance.  It's been six years since  and last year I was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over         farmers in Kenya and Rwanda against drought. They owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two Euros in premium. It's microinsurance. Now  traditional insurance doesn't work with two to three Euros of premium  because traditional insurance relies on farm visits. A farmer here in Germany would be visited for the start of the season  halfway through  and at the end  and again if there was a loss  to estimate the damages. For a small scale farmer in the middle of Africa  the maths of doing those visits simply don't add up. So instead  we rely on technology and data. This satellite measures whether there were clouds or not  because think about it  If there are clouds  then you might have some rain  but if there are no clouds  then it's actually impossible for it to rain. These images show the onset of the rains this season in Kenya. You see that around March    the clouds move in and then disappear  and then around the March     the clouds really move in. That  and those clouds  were the onset of the rains this year. This satellite covers the whole of Africa and goes back as far as       and that's important  because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last    years  you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future  and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought. The data alone isn't enough. We devise agronomic algorithms which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when. For example  for maize at planting  you need to have two days of rain for farmers to plant  and then it needs to rain once every two weeks for the crop to properly germinate. After that  you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves  whereas at flowering  you need it to rain more frequently  about once every    days for the crop to form its cob. At the end of the season  you actually don't want it to rain  because rains then can damage the crop. Devising such a cover is difficult  but it turned out the real challenge was selling insurance. We set ourselves a modest target of     farmers insured after our first season. After a couple of months' intense marketing  we had signed up the grand total of     farmers. I was disappointed and confounded. Everybody kept telling me that farmers wanted insurance  but our prime customers simply weren't buying. They were waiting to see what would happen  didn't trust insurance companies  or thought   I've managed for so many years. Why would I buy insurance now   Now many of you know microcredit  the method of providing small loans to poor people pioneered by Muhammad Yunus  who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Grameen Bank. Turns out  selling microcredit isn't the same as selling insurance. For credit  a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank  and if it succeeds  the bank will advance him money. That's an attractive proposition. For insurance  the farmer needs to trust the insurance company  and needs to advance the insurance company money. It's a very different value proposition. And so the uptick of insurance has been slow  with so far only  .  percent of Africans taking up insurance in       and half of that number is in one country  South Africa. We tried for some years selling insurance directly to farmers  with very high marketing cost and very limited success. Then we realized that there were many organizations working with farmers  seed companies  microfinance institutions  mobile phone companies  government agencies. They were all providing loans to farmers  and often  just before they'd finalize the loan  the farmer would say   But what if it doesn't rain  How do you expect me to repay my loan   Many of these organizations were taking on the risk themselves  simply hoping that that year  the worst wouldn't happen. Most of the organizations  however  were limiting their growth in agriculture. They couldn't take on this kind of risk. These organizations became our customers  and when combining credit and insurance  interesting things can happen. Let me tell you one more story. At the start of February      in western Kenya  the rains started  and they started early  and when rains start early  farmers are encouraged  because it usually means that the season is going to be good. So they took out loans and planted. For the next three weeks  there wasn't a single drop of rain  and the crops that had germinated so well shriveled and died. We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about       farmers in that area  and we called them up and said   Look  we know about the drought. We've got you. We'll give you         Euros at the end of the season.  They said   Wow  that's great  but that'll be late. Could you give us the money now  Then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest this season.  So we convinced our insurance partners  and later that April  these farmers replanted. We took the idea of replanting to a seed company and convinced them to price the cost of insurance into every bag of seed  and in every bag  we packed a card that had a number on it  and when the farmers would open the card  they'd text in that number  and that number would actually help us to locate the farmer and allocate them to a satellite pixel. A satellite would then measure the rainfall for the next three weeks  and if it didn't rain  we'd replace their seed. One of the first   One of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was Bosco Mwinyi. We visited his farm later that August  and I wish I could show you the smile on his face when he showed us his harvest  because it warmed my heart and it made me realize why selling insurance can be a good thing. But you know  he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture  so we had to zoom out a lot. Insurance secured his harvest that season  and I believe that today  we have all the tools to enable African farmers to take control of their own destiny. No more years of the cup. Instead  I am looking forward to  at least somehow  the year of the insurance  or the year of the great harvest. Thank you. Talking about empowerment is odd  because when we talk about empowerment  what affects us most are the stories. So I want to begin with an everyday story. What is it really like to be a young woman in India  Now  I've spent the last    years of my life in India  lived in three small towns  two major cities  and I've had several experiences. When I was seven  a private tutor who used to come home to teach me mathematics molested me. He would put his hand up my skirt. He put his hand up my skirt and told me he knew how to make me feel good. At     a boy from my high school circulated an email detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me because I didn't pay attention to him. At     I helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older man escape an abusive marriage. At     when my friend and I were walking down the road one afternoon  a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us. We called people for help  and nobody came. At     when I was walking home one evening  two men on a motorcycle attacked me. I spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries. So throughout my life  I've seen women   family  friends  colleagues   live through these experiences  and they seldom talk about it. So in simple words  life in India is not easy. But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear. I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on. So  what happened one night in December      changed my life. So a young girl  a    year old student  boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend. There were six men on the bus  young men who you might encounter every day in India  and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the Indian and international media. This girl was raped repeatedly  forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod  beaten  bitten  and left to die. Her friend was gagged  attacked  and knocked unconscious. She died on the   th of December. And at a time when most of us here were preparing to welcome the new year  India plunged into darkness. For the first time in our history  men and women in Indian cities woke up to the horrific truth about the true state of women in the country. Now  like many other young women  I was absolutely terrified. I couldn't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital. I was angry and I was frustrated  but most of all  I felt utterly  completely helpless. But really  what do you do  right  Some write blogs  some ignore it  some join protests. I did all of it. In fact  that was what everyone was doing two years ago. So the media was filled with stories about all the horrific deeds that Indian men are capable of. They were compared to animals  sexually repressed beasts. In fact  so alien and unthinkable was this event in an Indian mind that the response from the Indian media  public and politicians proved one point  No one knew what to do. And no one wanted to be responsible for it. In fact  these were a few insensitive comments which were made in the media by prominent people in response to sexual violence against women in general. So the first one is made by a member of parliament  the second one is made by a spiritual leader  and the third one was actually the defendants' lawyer when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away. Now  as a woman watching this day after day  I was tired. So as a writer and gender activist  I have written extensively on women  but this time  I realized it was different  because a part of me realized I was a part of that young woman too  and I decided I wanted to change this. So I did something spontaneous  hasty. I logged on to a citizen journalism platform called iReport  and I recorded a video talking about what the scene was like in Bangalore. I talked about how I felt  I talked about the ground realities  and I talked about the frustrations of living in India. In a few hours  the blog was shared widely  and comments and thoughts poured in from across the world. In that moment  a few things occurred to me. One  technology was always at hand for many young women like me. Two  like me  most young women hardly use it to express their views. Three  I realized for the first time that my voice mattered. So in the months that followed  I covered a trail of events in Bangalore which had no space in the mainstream news. In Cubbon Park  which is a big park in Bangalore  I gathered with over     others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape. When I reported about these events  I felt I had charge  I felt like I had a channel to release all the emotions I had inside me. I attended the town hall march when students held up signs saying  Kill them  hang them.   You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters.  I went to a candlelight vigil where citizens gathered together to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly  and I recorded a lot of blogs in response to how worrying the situation was in India at that point.   I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say   Now  the reactions confused me. While supportive comments poured in from across the world  as did vicious ones. So some called me a hypocrite. Some called me a victim  a rape apologist. Some even said I had a political motive. But this one comment kind of describes what we are discussing here today. But I was soon to learn that this was not all. As empowered as I felt with the new liberty that this citizen journalism channel gave me  I found myself in an unfamiliar situation. So sometime last August  I logged onto Facebook and I was looking through my news feed  and I noticed there was a link that was being shared by my friends. I clicked on the link  it led me back to a report uploaded by an American girl called Michaela Cross. The report was titled   India  The story you never wanted to hear.  And in this report  she recounted her firsthand account of facing sexual harassment in India. She wrote   There is no way to prepare for the eyes  the eyes that every day stared with such entitlement at my body  with no change of expression whether I met their gaze or not. Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's  I got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece.  She called India a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell. She said she was stalked  groped  and masturbated at. Now  late that evening  the report went viral. It was on news channels across the world. Everyone was discussing it. It had over a million views  a thousand comments and shares  and I found myself witnessing a very similar thing. The media was caught in this vicious cycle of opinion and outburst and no outcome whatsoever. So that night  as I sat wondering how I should respond  I found myself filled with doubt. You see  as a writer  I approached this issue as an observer  as an Indian  I felt embarrassment and disbelief  and as an activist  I looked at it as a defender of rights  but as a citizen journalist  I suddenly felt very vulnerable. I mean  here she was  a young woman who was using a channel to talk about her experience just as I was  and yet I felt unsettled. You see  no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act. Empowerment is often made to sound as if it's an ideal  it's a wonderful outcome. When we talk about empowerment  we often talk about giving people access to materials  giving them access to tools. But the thing is  empowerment is an emotion. It's a feeling. The first step to empowerment is to give yourself the authority  the key to independent will  and for women everywhere  no matter who we are or where we come from  that is the most difficult step. We fear the sound of our own voice  for it means admission  but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment. Now in this situation where I was faced with so many different kinds of realities  I was unsure how to judge  because I didn't know what it would mean for me. I feared to judge because I didn't know what it would be if I didn't support the same view as this girl. I didn't know what it would mean for me if I was challenging someone else's truth. But yet  it was simple. I had to make a decision  Should I speak up or should I stay quiet  So after a lot of thought  I recorded a video blog in response  and I told Michaela  well  there are different sides to India  and I also tried to explain that things would be okay and I expressed my regret for what she had faced. And a few days later  I was invited to talk on air with her  and for the first time  I reached out to this girl who I had never met  who was so far away  but yet I felt so close to. Since this report came to light  more young people than ever were discussing sexual harassment on the campus  and the university that Michaela belonged to gave her the assistance she needed. The university even took measures to train its students to equip them with the skills that they need to confront challenges such as harassment  and for the first the time  I felt I wasn't alone. You see  if there's anything that I've learned as an active citizen journalist over the past few years  it is our dire lack as a society to actively find avenues where our voices can be heard. We don't realize that when we are standing up  we are not just standing up as individuals  we are standing up for our communities  our friends  our peers. Most of us say that women are denied their rights  but the truth is  oftentimes  women deny themselves these rights. In a recent survey in India     percent of the women who work in I.T.  aviation  hospitality and call centers  said they didn't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening. In Bangalore  where I come from  this number is    percent. In rural areas in India  if anything is to go by the recent gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha and Aligarh are supposed to go by  we need to act really soon. Don't get me wrong  the challenges that women will face in telling their stories is real  but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums to participate in our system and not just pursue the media blindly. Today  more women than ever are standing up and questioning the government in India  and this is a result of that courage. There is a sixfold increase in women reporting harassment  and the government passed the Criminal Law  Amendment  Act in      to protect women against sexual assault. As I end this talk  I just want to say that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets  but let us speak up. Let us fight the shame and talk about it. It could be a platform  a community  your loved one  whoever or whatever you choose  but let us speak up. The truth is  the end to this problem begins with us. Thank you. So recently  some white guys and some black women swapped Twitter avatars  or pictures online. They didn't change their content  they kept tweeting the same as usual  but suddenly  the white guys noticed they were getting called the n word all the time and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse  whereas the black women all of a sudden noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them. Now  if you're my five year old  your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally fairies riding puppies. That's a thing. Google it. But the rest of us know that the Internet can be a really ugly place. I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that I think are healthy for our democracy. I'm talking about nasty personal attacks. Maybe it's happened to you  but it's at least twice as likely to happen  and be worse  if you're a woman  a person of color  or gay  or more than one at the same time. In fact  just as I was writing this talk  I found a Twitter account called  SallyKohnSucks. The bio says that I'm a  man hater and a bull dyke and the only thing I've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality.  Which  incidentally  is only a third correct. I mean  lies   Laughter  But seriously  we all say we hate this crap. The question is whether you're willing to make a personal sacrifice to change it. I don't mean giving up the Internet. I mean changing the way you click  because clicking is a public act. It's no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers. Increasingly  we're all the media. I used to think  oh  okay  I get dressed up  I put on a lot of makeup  I go on television  I talk about the news. That is a public act of making media. And then I go home and I browse the web and I'm reading Twitter  and that's a private act of consuming media. I mean  of course it is. I'm in my pajamas. Wrong. Everything we blog  everything we Tweet  and everything we click is a public act of making media. We are the new editors. We decide what gets attention based on what we give our attention to. That's how the media works now. There's all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on  and that in turn shapes our whole culture. Over three out of five Americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now  but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five Americans are clicking on the same insult oriented  rumor mongering trash that feeds the nastiest impulses in our society. In an increasingly noisy media landscape  the incentive is to make more noise to be heard  and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty. It does not have to be that way. It does not. We can change the incentive. For starters  there are two things we can all do. First  don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt. If someone is being abused online  do something. Be a hero. This is your chance. Speak up. Speak out. Be a good person. Drown out the negative with the positive. And second  we've got to stop clicking on the lowest common denominator  bottom feeding linkbait. If you don't like the      all Kardashian all the time programming  you've got to stop clicking on the stories about Kim Kardashian's sideboob. I know you do it.  Applause  You too  apparently. I mean  really  same example  if you don't like politicians calling each other names  stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party. Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it. It makes it worse  the fire spreads. Our whole culture gets burned. If what gets the most clicks wins  then we have to start shaping the world we want with our clicks  because clicking is a public act. So click responsibly. Thank you. How many times have you used the word  awesome  today  Once  Twice  Seventeen times  Do you remember what you were describing when you used the word  No  I didn't think so  because it's come down to this  people  You're using the word incorrectly  and tonight I hope to show you how to put the  awe  back in  awesome.  Recently  I was dining at an outdoor cafe  and the server came up to our table  and asked us if we had dined there before  and I said   Yes  yes  we have.  And she said   Awesome.  And I thought   Really  Awesome or just merely good that we decided to visit your restaurant again   The other day  one of my coworkers asked me if I could save that file as a PDF  and I said   Well  of course   and he said   Awesome.  Seriously  can saving anything as a PDF be awesome  Sadly  the frequent overuse of the word  awesome  has now replaced words like  great  and  thank you.  So Webster's dictionary defines the word  awesome  as fear mingled with admiration or reverence  a feeling produced by something majestic. Now  with that in mind  was your Quiznos sandwich awesome  How about that parking space  Was that awesome  Or that game the other day  Was that awesome  The answer is no  no and no. A sandwich can be delicious  that parking space can be nearby  and that game can be a blowout  but not everything can be awesome. So when you use the word  awesome  to describe the most mundane of things  you're taking away the very power of the word. This author says   Snowy days or finding money in your pants is awesome.  Um  no  it is not  and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.  Laughter  So in other words  if you have everything  you value nothing. It's a lot like drinking from a firehose like this jackass right here. There's no dynamic  there's no highs or lows  if everything is awesome. Ladies and gentlemen  here are    things that are truly awesome. Imagine  if you will  having to schlep everything on your back. Wouldn't this be easier for me if I could roll this home  Yes  so I think I'll invent the wheel. The wheel  ladies and gentlemen. Is the wheel awesome  Say it with me. Yes  the wheel is awesome  The Great Pyramids were the tallest man made structure in the world for       years. Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone. Were the Great Pyramids awesome  Yes  the pyramids were awesome. The Grand Canyon. Come on. It's almost    million years old. Is the Grand Canyon awesome  Yes  the Grand Canyon is. Louis Daguerre invented photography in       and earlier today  when you whipped out your smartphone and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich  and you know who you are   wasn't that easier than exposing the image to copper plates coated with iodized silver  I mean  come on. Is photography awesome  Yes  photography is awesome. D Day  June          the Allied invasion of Normandy  the largest amphibious invasion in world history. Was D Day awesome  Yes  it was awesome. Did you eat food today  Did you eat  Then you can thank the honeybee  that's the one  because if crops aren't pollinated  we can't grow food  and then we're all going to die. It's just like that. But it's not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower  although that would be awesome. Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me  Landing on the moon  Come on  Apollo   . Are you kidding me  Sixty six years after the Wright Brothers took off from Kitty Hawk  North Carolina  Neil Armstrong was         miles away. That's like from here to the moon. That's one small step for a man  one giant leap for awesome  You're damn right  it was. Woodstock        Rolling Stone Magazine said this changed the history of rock and roll. Tickets were only    dollars back then. You can't even buy a freaking t shirt for that now. Jimi Hendrix's version of  The Star Spangled Banner  was the most iconic. Was Woodstock awesome  Yes  it was awesome. Sharks  They're at the top of the food chain. Sharks have multiple rows of teeth that grow in their jaw and they move forward like a conveyor belt. Some sharks can lose        teeth in their lifetime. Does awesome inspire fear  Oh  hell yeah  sharks are awesome  The Internet was born in      and it instantly took over global communication  and later tonight  when all these PowerPoints are uplifted to the Internet so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk and watch this crap  the Internet is awesome. And finally  finally some of you can't wait to come up and tell me how awesome my PowerPoint was. I will save you the time. It was not awesome  but it was true  and I hope it was entertaining  and out of all the audiences I've ever had  y'all are the most recent. Thank you and good night. Why does the universe exist  Why is there   Okay. Okay.  Laughter  This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn. Why is there a world  why are we in it  and why is there something rather than nothing at all  I mean  this is the super ultimate  why  question  So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence  the puzzle of existence  where we are now in addressing it  and why you should care  and I hope you do care. The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that those who don't wonder about the contingency of their existence  of the contingency of the world's existence  are mentally deficient. That's a little harsh  but still.  Laughter  So this has been called the most sublime and awesome mystery  the deepest and most far reaching question man can pose. It's obsessed great thinkers. Ludwig Wittgenstein  perhaps the greatest philosopher of the   th century  was astonished that there should be a world at all. He wrote in his  Tractatus   Proposition  .     It is not how things are in the world that is the mystical  it's that the world exists.  And if you don't like taking your epigrams from a philosopher  try a scientist. John Archibald Wheeler  one of the great physicists of the   th century  the teacher of Richard Feynman  the coiner of the term  black hole   he said   I want to know how come the quantum  how come the universe  how come existence   And my friend Martin Amis   sorry that I'll be doing a lot of name dropping in this talk  so get used to it   my dear friend Martin Amis once said that we're about five Einsteins away from answering the mystery of where the universe came from. And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins in the audience tonight. Any Einsteins  Show of hands  No  No  No  No Einsteins  Okay. So this question  why is there something rather than nothing  this sublime question  was posed rather late in intellectual history. It was towards the end of the   th century  the philosopher Leibniz who asked it  a very smart guy  Leibniz  who invented the calculus independently of Isaac Newton  at about the same time  but for Leibniz  who asked why is there something rather than nothing  this was not a great mystery. He either was or pretended to be an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook  and he said it's obvious why the world exists  because God created it. And God created  indeed  out of nothing at all. That's how powerful God is. He doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of. He can make it out of sheer nothingness  creation ex nihilo. And by the way  this is what most Americans today believe. There is no mystery of existence for them. God made it. So let's put this in an equation. I don't have any slides so I'm going to mime my visuals  so use your imaginations. So it's God   nothing   the world. Okay  Now that's the equation. And so maybe you don't believe in God. Maybe you're a scientific atheist or an unscientific atheist  and you don't believe in God  and you're not happy with it. By the way  even if we have this equation  God   nothing   the world  there's already a problem  Why does God exist  God doesn't exist by logic alone unless you believe the ontological argument  and I hope you don't  because it's not a good argument. So it's conceivable  if God were to exist  he might wonder  I'm eternal  I'm all powerful  but where did I come from  Whence then am I  God speaks in a more formal English. And so one theory is that God was so bored with pondering the puzzle of His own existence that He created the world just to distract himself. But anyway  let's forget about God. Take God out of the equation  We have            nothing   the world. Now  if you're a Buddhist  you might want to stop right there  because essentially what you've got is nothing   the world  and by symmetry of identity  that means the world   nothing. Okay  And to a Buddhist  the world is just a whole lot of nothing. It's just a big cosmic vacuity. And we think there's a lot of something out there but that's because we're enslaved by our desires. If we let our desires melt away  we'll see the world for what it truly is  a vacuity  nothingness  and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead.  Laughter  So that's the Buddhist thinking. But I'm a Westerner  and I'm still concerned with the puzzle of existence  so I've got              this is going to get serious in a minute  so              nothing   the world. What are we going to put in that blank  Well  how about science  Science is our best guide to the nature of reality  and the most fundamental science is physics. That tells us what naked reality really is  that reveals what I call TAUFOTU  the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe. So maybe physics can fill this blank  and indeed  since about the late     s or around       physicists have purported to give a purely scientific explanation of how a universe like ours could have popped into existence out of sheer nothingness  a quantum fluctuation out of the void. Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists  more recently Alex Vilenkin  and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine  Lawrence Krauss  who wrote a book called  A Universe from Nothing   and Lawrence thinks that he's given   he's a militant atheist  by the way  so he's gotten God out of the picture. The laws of quantum field theory  the state of the art physics  can show how out of sheer nothingness  no space  no time  no matter  nothing  a little nugget of false vacuum can fluctuate into existence  and then  by the miracle of inflation  blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos we see around us. Okay  this is a really ingenious scenario. It's very speculative. It's fascinating. But I've got a big problem with it  and the problem is this  It's a pseudo religious point of view. Now  Lawrence thinks he's an atheist  but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview. He sees physical laws as being like divine commands. The laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux   Let there be light.  The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss  that it's pregnant with being. They can call a world into existence out of nothing. But that's a very primitive view of what a physical law is  right  We know that physical laws are actually generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities in the world. They don't exist outside the world. They don't have any ontic cloud of their own. They can't call a world into existence out of nothingness. That's a very primitive view of what a scientific law is. And if you don't believe me on this  listen to Stephen Hawking  who himself put forward a model of the cosmos that was self contained  didn't require any outside cause  any creator  and after proposing this  Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled. He said  this model is just equations. What breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe  He was puzzled by this  so equations themselves can't do the magic  can't resolve the puzzle of existence. And besides  even if the laws could do that  why this set of laws  Why quantum field theory that describes a universe with a certain number of forces and particles and so forth  Why not a completely different set of laws  There are many  many mathematically consistent sets of laws. Why not no laws at all  Why not sheer nothingness  So this is a problem  believe it or not  that reflective physicists really think a lot about  and at this point they tend to go metaphysical  say  well  maybe the set of laws that describes our universe  it's just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality  but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality  and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist  they're all out there. We just see a little tiny part of reality that's described by the laws of quantum field theory  but there are many  many other worlds  parts of reality that are described by vastly different theories that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine  that are inconceivably exotic. Steven Weinberg  the father of the standard model of particle physics  has actually flirted with this idea himself  that all possible realities actually exist. Also  a younger physicist  Max Tegmark  who believes that all mathematical structures exist  and mathematical existence is the same thing as physical existence  so we have this vastly rich multiverse that encompasses every logical possibility. Now  in taking this metaphysical way out  these physicists and also philosophers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to Plato. It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity  or the great chain of being  that reality is actually as full as possible. It's as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be. So we have these two extremes now. We have sheer nothingness on one side  and we have this vision of a reality that encompasses every conceivable world at the other extreme  the fullest possible reality  nothingness  the simplest possible reality. Now what's in between these two extremes  There are all kinds of intermediate realities that include some things and leave out others. So one of these intermediate realities is  say  the most mathematically elegant reality  that leaves out the inelegant bits  the ugly asymmetries and so forth. Now  there are some physicists who will tell you that we're actually living in the most elegant reality. I think that Brian Greene is in the audience  and he has written a book called  The Elegant Universe.  He claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant. Don't believe him.  Laughter  It's a pious hope  I wish it were true  but I think the other day he admitted to me it's really an ugly universe. It's stupidly constructed  it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles  and what the hell is dark energy  It's a stick and bubble gum contraption. It's not an elegant universe.  Laughter  And then there's the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense. You should get solemn now  because a world in which sentient beings don't suffer needlessly  in which there aren't things like childhood cancer or the Holocaust. This is an ethical conception. Anyway  so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality  various special realities. Nothingness is special. It's the simplest. Then there's the most elegant possible reality. That's special. The fullest possible reality  that's special. But what are we leaving out here  There's also just the crummy  generic realities that aren't special in any way  that are sort of random. They're infinitely removed from nothingness  but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness. They're a mixture of chaos and order  of mathematical elegance and ugliness. So I would describe these realities as an infinite  mediocre  incomplete mess  a generic reality  a kind of cosmic junk shot. And these realities  is there a deity in any of these realities  Maybe  but the deity isn't perfect like the Judeo Christian deity. The deity isn't all good and all powerful. It might be instead     percent malevolent but only    percent effective  which pretty much describes the world we see around us  I think.  Laughter  So I would like to propose that the resolution to the mystery of existence is that the reality we exist in is one of these generic realities. Reality has to turn out some way. It can either turn out to be nothing or everything or something in between. So if it has some special feature  like being really elegant or really full or really simple  like nothingness  that would require an explanation. But if it's just one of these random  generic realities  there's no further explanation for it. And indeed  I would say that's the reality we live in. That's what science is telling us. At the beginning of the week  we got the exciting information that the theory of inflation  which predicts a big  infinite  messy  arbitrary  pointless reality  it's like a big frothing champagne coming out of a bottle endlessly  a vast universe  mostly a wasteland with little pockets of charm and order and peace  this has been confirmed  this inflationary scenario  by the observations made by radio telescopes in Antarctica that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves from just before the Big Bang. I'm sure you all know about this. So anyway  I think there's some evidence that this really is the reality that we're stuck with. Now  why should you care  Well    Laughter    the question   Why does the world exist   that's the cosmic question  it sort of rhymes with a more intimate question  Why do I exist  Why do you exist  you know  our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable  because there's an enormous number of genetically possible humans  if you can compute it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth  and a back of the envelope calculation will tell you there are about    to the       th possible humans  genetically. That's between a googol and a googolplex. And the number of the actual humans that have existed is     billion  maybe    billion  an infinitesimal fraction  so all of us  we've won this amazing cosmic lottery. We're here. Okay. So what kind of reality do we want to live in  Do we want to live in a special reality  What if we were living in the most elegant possible reality  Imagine the existential pressure on us to live up to that  to be elegant  not to pull down the tone of it. Or  what if we were living in the fullest possible reality  Well then our existence would be guaranteed  because every possible thing exists in that reality  but our choices would be meaningless. If I really struggle morally and agonize and I decide to do the right thing  what difference does it make  because there are an infinite number of versions of me also doing the right thing and an infinite number doing the wrong thing. So my choices are meaningless. So we don't want to live in that special reality. And as for the special reality of nothingness  we wouldn't be having this conversation. So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre  there are nasty bits and nice bits and we could make the nice bits bigger and the nasty bits smaller and that gives us a kind of purpose in life. The universe is absurd  but we can still construct a purpose  and that's a pretty good one  and the overall mediocrity of reality kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity we all feel in the core of our being. And I know you feel it. I know you're all special  but you're still kind of secretly mediocre  don't you think  So anyway  you may say  this  puzzle  the mystery of existence  it's just silly mystery mongering. You're not astonished at the existence of the universe and you're in good company. Bertrand Russell said   I should say the universe is just there  and that's all.  Just a brute fact. And my professor at Columbia  Sidney Morgenbesser  a great philosophical wag  when I said to him   Professor Morgenbesser  why is there something rather than nothing   And he said   Oh  even if there was nothing  you still wouldn't be satisfied.  So    Laughter    okay. So you're not astonished. I don't care. But I will tell you something to conclude that I guarantee you will astonish you  because it's astonished all of the brilliant  wonderful people I've met at this TED conference  when I've told them  and it's this  Never in my life have I had a cell phone. Thank you. Hi  kids. I'm   . My husband is   . My parents are in their late   s  and Olivia  the dog  is   . So let's talk about aging. Let me tell you how I feel when I see my wrinkles in the mirror and I realize that some parts of me have dropped and I can't find them down there. Mary Oliver says in one of her poems   Tell me  what is it that you plan to do with your one wild and precious life   Me  I intend to live passionately. When do we start aging  Society decides when we are old  usually around     when we get Medicare  but we really start aging at birth. We are aging right now  and we all experience it differently. We all feel younger than our real age  because the spirit never ages. I am still   . Sophia Loren. Look at her. She says that everything you see she owes to spaghetti. I tried it and gained    pounds in the wrong places. But attitude  aging is also attitude and health. But my real mentor in this journey of aging is Olga Murray. This California girl at    started working in Nepal to save young girls from domestic bondage. At     she has saved        girls  and she has changed the culture in the country. Now it is illegal for fathers to sell their daughters into servitude. She has also founded orphanages and nutritional clinics. She is always happy and eternally young. What have I lost in the last decades  People  of course  places  and the boundless energy of my youth  and I'm beginning to lose independence  and that scares me. Ram Dass says that dependency hurts  but if you accept it  there is less suffering. After a very bad stroke  his ageless soul watches the changes in the body with tenderness  and he is grateful to the people who help him. What have I gained  Freedom  I don't have to prove anything anymore. I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was  who I want to be  or what other people expect me to be. I don't have to please men anymore  only animals. I keep telling my superego to back off and let me enjoy what I still have. My body may be falling apart  but my brain is not  yet. I love my brain. I feel lighter. I don't carry grudges  ambition  vanity  none of the deadly sins that are not even worth the trouble. It's great to let go. I should have started sooner. And I also feel softer because I'm not scared of being vulnerable. I don't see it as weakness anymore. And I've gained spirituality. I'm aware that before  death was in the neighborhood. Now  it's next door  or in my house. I try to live mindfully and be present in the moment. By the way  the Dalai Lama is someone who has aged beautifully  but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate  Meditation helps. Isabel Allende  Ommm. Ommm. There it is. And it's good to start early. You know  for a vain female like myself  it's very hard to age in this culture. Inside  I feel good  I feel charming  seductive  sexy. Nobody else sees that.  Laughter  I'm invisible. I want to be the center of attention. I hate to be invisible. This is Grace Dammann. She has been in a wheelchair for six years after a terrible car accident. She says that there is nothing more sensual than a hot shower  that every drop of water is a blessing to the senses. She doesn't see herself as disabled. In her mind  she's still surfing in the ocean. Ethel Seiderman  a feisty  beloved activist in the place where I live in California. She wears red patent shoes  and her mantra is that one scarf is nice but two is better. She has been a widow for nine years  but she's not looking for another mate. She says that there is only a limited number of ways you can screw   well  she says it in another way   and she has tried them all. I  on the other hand  I still have erotic fantasies with Antonio Banderas   and my poor husband has to put up with it. So how can I stay passionate  I cannot will myself to be passionate at   . I have been training for some time  and when I feel flat and bored  I fake it. Attitude  attitude. How do I train  I train by saying yes to whatever comes my way  drama  comedy  tragedy  love  death  losses. Yes to life. And I train by trying to stay in love. It doesn't always work  but you cannot blame me for trying. And  on a final note  retirement in Spanish is jubilaci n. Jubilation. Celebration. We have paid our dues. We have contributed to society. Now it's our time  and it's a great time. Unless you are ill or very poor  you have choices. I have chosen to stay passionate  engaged with an open heart. I am working on it every day. Want to join me  Thank you. June Cohen  So Isabel   IA  Thank you. JC  First of all  I never like to presume to speak for the TED community  but I would like to tell you that I have a feeling we can all agree that you are still charming  seductive and sexy. Yes  IA  Aww  thank you.  Applause  JC  Hands down. IA  No  it's makeup. Moderator  Now  would it be awkward if I asked you a follow up question about your erotic fantasies  IA  Oh  of course. About what  Moderator  About your erotic fantasies. IA  With Antonio Banderas. Moderator  I was just wondering if you have anything more to share. IA  Well  one of them is that    Laughter  One of them is that I place a naked Antonio Banderas on a Mexican tortilla  I slather him with guacamole and salsa  I roll him up  and I eat him.  Laughter  Thank you. I'm an industrial engineer. The goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources. While working at Toyota  all I knew was how to make cars until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki  who came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon neutral. I was so fascinated that I decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer. Soon  I started making a forest in the backyard of my own house  and this is how it looks after three years. These forests  compared to a conventional plantation  grow    times faster  they're    times more dense  and     times more biodiverse. Within two years of having this forest in our backyard  I could observe that the groundwater didn't dry during summers  the number of bird species I spotted in this area doubled. Quality of air became better  and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house. I wanted to make more of these forests. I was so moved by these results that I wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business  so I founded a company which is an end to end service provider to create these native natural forests. But to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry  we had to standardize the process of forest making. So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System known for its quality and efficiency for the process of forest making. For an example  the core of TPS  Toyota Production System  lies in heijunka  which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line. We replaced these cars with trees  using which now we can make multi layered forests. These forests utilize     percent vertical space. They are so dense that one can't even walk into them. For an example  we can make a     tree forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars. In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint  we started utilizing local biomass as soil amender and fertilizers. For example  coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw  powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted. Once planted  we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere. And using these simple improvisations  today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone. Today  we are making forests in houses  in schools  even in factories with the corporates. But that's not enough. There is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands. So we let it happen. Today  we are working on an Internet based platform where we are going to share our methodology on an open source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there  using our methodology. At the click of a button  they can get to know all the native species of their place. By installing a small hardware probe on site  we can do remote soil testing  using which we can give step by step instructions on forest making remotely. Also we can monitor the growth of this forest without being on site. This methodology  I believe  has a potential. By sharing  we can actually bring back our native forests. Now  when you go back home  if you see a barren piece of land  do remember that it can be a potential forest. Thank you very much. Thanks. This is a photograph of a man whom for many years I plotted to kill. This is my father  Clinton George  Bageye  Grant. He's called Bageye because he has permanent bags under his eyes. As a    year old  along with my siblings  I dreamt of scraping off the poison from fly killer paper into his coffee  grounded down glass and sprinkling it over his breakfast  loosening the carpet on the stairs so he would trip and break his neck. But come the day  he would always skip that loose step  he would always bow out of the house without so much as a swig of coffee or a bite to eat. And so for many years  I feared that my father would die before I had a chance to kill him. Up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back  Bageye had been a terrifying ogre. He teetered permanently on the verge of rage  rather like me  as you see. He worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton and demanded total silence throughout the house  so that when we came home from school at      in the afternoon  we would huddle beside the TV  and rather like safe crackers  we would twiddle with the volume control knob on the TV so it was almost inaudible. And at times  when we were like this  so much  Shhh   so much  Shhh  going on in the house that I imagined us to be like the German crew of a U boat creeping along the edge of the ocean whilst up above  on the surface  HMS Bageye patrolled ready to drop death charges at the first sound of any disturbance. So that lesson was the lesson that  Do not draw attention to yourself either in the home or outside of the home.  Maybe it's a migrant lesson. We were to be below the radar  so there was no communication  really  between Bageye and us and us and Bageye  and the sound that we most looked forward to  you know when you're a child and you want your father to come home and it's all going to be happy and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening. Well the sound that we looked forward to was the click of the door closing  which meant he'd gone and would not come back. So for three decades  I never laid eyes on my father  nor he on me. We never spoke to each other for three decades  and then a couple of years ago  I decided to turn the spotlight on him.  You are being watched. Actually  you are. You are being watched.  That was his mantra to us  his children. Time and time again he would say this to us. And this was the     s  it was Luton  where he worked at Vauxhall Motors  and he was a Jamaican. And what he meant was  you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant are being watched to see which way you turn  to see whether you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you  of being feckless  work shy  destined for a life of crime. You are being watched  so confound their expectations of you. To that end  Bageye and his friends  mostly Jamaican  exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura  Turn your best side to the world  show your best face to the world. If you have seen some of the images of the Caribbean people arriving in the '  s and '  s  you might have noticed that a lot of the men wear trilbies. Now  there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica. They invented that tradition for their arrival here. They wanted to project themselves in a way that they wanted to be perceived  so that the way they looked and the names that they gave themselves defined them. So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes. Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear. Anxious is always anxious. Clock has one arm longer than the other. And my all time favorite was the guy they called Summerwear. When Summerwear came to this country from Jamaica in the early '  s  he insisted on wearing light summer suits  no matter the weather  and in the course of researching their lives  I asked my mom   Whatever became of Summerwear   And she said   He caught a cold and died.   Laughter  But men like Summerwear taught us the importance of style. Maybe they exaggerated their style because they thought that they were not considered to be quite civilized  and they transferred that generational attitude or anxiety onto us  the next generation  so much so that when I was growing up  if ever on the television news or radio a report came up about a black person committing some crime   a mugging  a murder  a burglary   we winced along with our parents  because they were letting the side down. You did not just represent yourself. You represented the group  and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with  in a way  that maybe you were going to be perceived in the same light. So that was what needed to be challenged. Our father and many of his colleagues exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving. They were built to transmit but not receive. We were to keep quiet. When our father did speak to us  it was from the pulpit of his mind. They clung to certainty in the belief that doubt would undermine them. But when I am working in my house and writing  after a day's writing  I rush downstairs and I'm very excited to talk about Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies and I'm so excited that my children stop me  and they say   Dad  nobody cares.  But they do care  actually. They cross over. Somehow they find their way to you. They shape their lives according to the narrative of your life  as I did with my father and my mother  perhaps  and maybe Bageye did with his father. And that was clearer to me in the course of looking at his life and understanding  as they say  the Native Americans say   Do not criticize the man until you can walk in his moccasins.  But in conjuring his life  it was okay and very straightforward to portray a Caribbean life in England in the     s with bowls of plastic fruit  polystyrene ceiling tiles  settees permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in. But what's more difficult to navigate is the emotional landscape between the generations  and the old adage that with age comes wisdom is not true. With age comes the veneer of respectability and a veneer of uncomfortable truths. But what was true was that my parents  my mother  and my father went along with it  did not trust the state to educate me. So listen to how I sound. They determined that they would send me to a private school  but my father worked at Vauxhall Motors. It's quite difficult to fund a private school education and feed his army of children. I remember going on to the school for the entrance exam  and my father said to the priest   it was a Catholic school   he wanted a better  heducation  for the boy  but also  he  my father  never even managed to pass worms  never mind entrance exams. But in order to fund my education  he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff  so my father would fund my education by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car  and that was made even more tricky because my father  that's not his car by the way. My father aspired to have a car like that  but my father had a beaten up Mini  and he never  being a Jamaican coming to this country  he never had a driving license  he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT. He thought   I know how to drive  why do I need the state's validation   But it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police  and we were stopped a lot by the police  and I was impressed by the way that my father dealt with the police. He would promote the policeman immediately  so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily. So my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica called  playing fool to catch wise.  But it lent also an idea that actually he was being diminished or belittled by the policeman   as a    year old boy  I saw that   but also there was an ambivalence towards authority. So on the one hand  there was a mocking of authority  but on the other hand  there was a deference towards authority  and these Caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority  which is very striking  very strange in a way  because migrants are very courageous people. They leave their homes. My father and my mother left Jamaica and they traveled       miles  and yet they were infantilized by travel. They were timid  and somewhere along the line  the natural order was reversed. The children became the parents to the parent. The Caribbean people came to this country with a five year plan  they would work  some money  and then go back  but the five years became     the    became     and before you know it  you're changing the wallpaper  and at that point  you know you're here to stay. Although there's still the kind of temporariness that our parents felt about being here  but we children knew that the game was up. I think there was a feeling that they would not be able to continue with the ideals of the life that they expected. The reality was very much different. And also  that was true of the reality of trying to educate me. Having started the process  my father did not continue. It was left to my mother to educate me  and as George Lamming would say  it was my mother who fathered me. Even in his absence  that old mantra remained  You are being watched. But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety  so much so that years later  when I was investigating why so many young black men were diagnosed with schizophrenia  six times more than they ought to be  I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say   Black people are schooled in paranoia.  And I wonder what Bageye would make of that. Now I also had a    year old son  and turned my attention to Bageye and I went in search of him. He was back in Luton  he was now     and I hadn't seen him for    odd years  and when he opened the door  I saw this tiny little man with lambent  smiling eyes  and he was smiling  and I'd never seen him smile. I was very disconcerted by that. But we sat down  and he had a Caribbean friend with him  talking some old time talk  and my father would look at me  and he looked at me as if I would miraculously disappear as I had arisen. And he turned to his friend  and he said   This boy and me have a deep  deep connection  deep  deep connection.  But I never felt that connection. If there was a pulse  it was very weak or hardly at all. And I almost felt in the course of that reunion that I was auditioning to be my father's son. When the book came out  it had fair reviews in the national papers  but the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian  it's the Luton News  and the Luton News ran the headline about the book   The Book That May Heal a    Year Old Rift.  And I understood that could also represent the rift between one generation and the next  between people like me and my father's generation  but there's no tradition in Caribbean life of memoirs or biographies. It was a tradition that you didn't chat about your business in public. But I welcomed that title  and I thought actually  yes  there is a possibility that this will open up conversations that we'd never had before. This will close the generation gap  perhaps. This could be an instrument of repair. And I even began to feel that this book may be perceived by my father as an act of filial devotion. Poor  deluded fool. Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be the public airing of his shortcomings. He was stung by my betrayal  and he went to the newspapers the next day and demanded a right of reply  and he got it with the headline  Bageye Bites Back.  And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal. I was no son of his. He recognized in his mind that his colors had been dragged through the mud  and he couldn't allow that. He had to restore his dignity  and he did so  and initially  although I was disappointed  I grew to admire that stance. There was still fire bubbling through his veins  even though he was    years old. And if it meant that we would now return to    years of silence  my father would say   If it's so  then it's so.  Jamaicans will tell you that there's no such thing as facts  there are only versions. We all tell ourselves the versions of the story that we can best live with. Each generation builds up an edifice which they are reluctant or sometimes unable to disassemble  but in the writing  my version of the story began to change  and it was detached from me. I lost my hatred of my father. I did no longer want him to die or to murder him  and I felt free  much freer than I'd ever felt before. And I wonder whether that freedness could be transferred to him. In that initial reunion  I was struck by an idea that I had very few photographs of myself as a young child. This is a photograph of me  nine months old. In the original photograph  I'm being held up by my father  Bageye  but when my parents separated  my mother excised him from all aspects of our lives. She took a pair of scissors and cut  him out of every photograph  and for years  I told myself the truth of this photograph was that you are alone  you are unsupported. But there's another way of looking at this photograph. This is a photograph that has the potential for a reunion  a potential to be reunited with my father  and in my yearning to be held up by my father  I held him up to the light. In that first reunion  it was very awkward and tense moments  and to lessen the tension  we decided to go for a walk. And as we walked  I was struck that I had reverted to being the child even though I was now towering above my father. I was almost a foot taller than my father. He was still the big man  and I tried to match his step. And I realized that he was walking as if he was still under observation  but I admired his walk. He walked like a man on the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal. There was dignity in defeat. Thank you. On November  th        a man named El Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane  the leader of the Jewish Defense League. Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder  but while serving time on lesser charges  he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks  including tunnels  synagogues and the United Nations headquarters. Thankfully  those plans were foiled by an FBI informant. Sadly  the      bombing of the World Trade Center was not. Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot. El Sayyid Nosair is my father. I was born in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania in      to him  an Egyptian engineer  and a loving American mother and grade school teacher  who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me. It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change. My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people  including the majority of Muslims  get to see. It's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another  it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part  we all want the same things out of life. However  in every religion  in every population  you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do. A few months prior to his arrest  he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends  he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice. He told me I'd be going with him the next morning. We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range  which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI. When it was my turn to shoot  my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about    yards off. That day  the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise  especially mine  the entire target burst into flames. My uncle turned to the other men  and in Arabic said   Ibn abuh.  Like father  like son. They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment  but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny. They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of. Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with       pounds of explosives into the sub level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower  causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over       others. These were the men I looked up to. These were the men I called ammu  which means uncle. By the time I turned     I had already moved    times in my life  and that instability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends. Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone  it was time to pack up and move to the next town. Being the perpetual new face in class  I was frequently the target of bullies. I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted  but as it turns out  being the quiet  chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition. So for the most part  I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games. For those reasons  my social skills were lacking  to say the least  and growing up in a bigoted household  I wasn't prepared for the real world. I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements  like a person's race or religion. So what opened my eyes  One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the      presidential elections. Through a college prep program  I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia. My particular group's focus was on youth violence  and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life  this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate. The members of our group came from many different walks of life. One day toward the end of the convention  I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish. Now  it had taken several days for this detail to come to light  and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us. I had never had a Jewish friend before  and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable. Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens  an amusement park. There  I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures  and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character. Most of my life  I'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin  and by extension  that all gay people were a negative influence. As chance would have it  I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there  and soon found that many were the kindest  least judgmental people I had ever met. Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others  and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated. Because of that feeling  I was able to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction. I don't know what it's like to be gay  but I'm well acquainted with being judged for something that's beyond my control. Then there was  The Daily Show.  On a nightly basis  Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person's race  religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one's character. He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one. Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place  and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me. One day  I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change  and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live. She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime  and said   I'm tired of hating people.  In that instant  I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you. Zak Ebrahim is not my real name. I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life. So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger  Well  that's simple. I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way  that although I had been subjected to this violent  intolerant ideology  that I did not become fanaticized. Instead  I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism  against the bigotry. I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones  for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives. For the victims of terrorism  I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father's actions. And with that simple fact  I stand here as proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race  and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father. I am not my father. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  everybody.  Applause  Thank you all.  Applause  Thanks a lot.  Applause  My dream is to build the world's first underground park in New York City. Now  why would someone want to build an underground park  and why in New York City  These three tough little buggers are  on the left  my grandmother  age five  and then her sister and brother  ages    and nine. This photo was taken just before they left from Italy to immigrate to the United States  just about a century ago. And like many immigrants at the time  they arrived on the Lower East Side in New York City and they encountered a crazy melting pot. What was amazing about their generation was that they were not only building new lives in this new  unfamiliar area  but they were also literally building the city. I've always been fascinated by those decades and by that history  and I would often beg my grandmother to tell me as many stories as possible about the old New York. But she would often just shrug it off  tell me to eat more meatballs  more pasta  and so I very rarely got any of the history that I wanted to hear about. The New York City that I encountered felt pretty built up. I always knew as a kid that I wanted to make a difference  and to somehow make the world more beautiful  more interesting and more just. I just didn't really know how. At first  I thought I wanted to go work abroad  so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya. But it felt weird to me that I knew more about local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown. I took a job with the City of New York  but very quickly felt frustrated with the slowness of government bureaucracy. I even took a job at Google  where very fast I drank the Kool Aid and believed almost wholeheartedly that technology could solve all social problems. But I still didn't feel like I was making the world a better place. It was in      that my friend and now business partner James Ramsey alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site  which is this. This is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan  and it was open between      and       just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area. And we learned also that the site was entirely abandoned in     . Fascinated by this discovery  we begged the authorities to draw us into the space  and we finally got a tour  and this is what we saw. Now  this photo doesn't really do it justice. It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space. It's a football field of unused land immediately below a very crowded area of the city  and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones on an archaeological dig  and all the details are all still there. It's really pretty remarkable. Now  the site itself is located at the very heart of the Lower East Side  and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city. New York City has two thirds the green space per resident as other big cities  and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space. So we immediately started thinking about how we could take this site and turn it into something that could be used for the public  but also could potentially even be green. Our plan  in a nutshell  is to draw natural sunlight underground using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street  directs it below the city sidewalks  and would allow plants and trees to grow with the light that's directed underneath. With this approach  you could take a site that looks like this today and transform it into something that looks like this. In       we first released some of these images  and what was funny was  a lot of people said to us   Oh  it kind of looks like the High Line underground.  And so what our nickname ended up becoming  and what ended up sticking  was the Lowline  so the Lowline was born. What was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel  and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible. So  like a crazy person  I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project. Here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse. Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology. You can see the six solar collectors at the center there. And here's the full exhibit all put together in this warehouse. You can see the solar canopy overhead  the light streaming in  and this entirely live green space below. So in the course of just a few weeks  tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit  and since that time  we've grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world. Here's a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the Line's site  and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next    years. Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there's really a lack of green space. So what we're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood  but more importantly will introduce a really community driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area. And right now  we're focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way. Here's our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself. So here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city  and invite people into this warm underground space. In the middle of winter  when it's absolutely freezing outside  the last place you'd want to go would be an outdoor space or outdoor park. The Lowline would really be a four season space and a respite for the city. So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings my own family's story full circle. If my grandparents and my parents were really focused on building the city up and out  I think my generation is focused on reclaiming the spaces that we already have  rediscovering our shared history  and reimagining how we can make our communities more interesting  more beautiful and more just. Thanks. Hans Rosling  I'm going to ask you three multiple choice questions. Use this device. Use this device to answer. The first question is  how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster  how did that change during the last century  Did it more than double  did it remain about the same in the world as a whole  or did it decrease to less than half  Please answer A  B or C. I see lots of answers. This is much faster than I do it at universities. They are so slow. They keep thinking  thinking  thinking. Oh  very  very good. And we go to the next question. So how long did women    years old in the world go to school  seven years  five years or three years  A  B or C  Please answer. And we go to the next question. In the last    years  how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change  Extreme poverty   not having  enough food for the day. Did it almost double  did it remain more or less the same  or did it halve  A  B or C  Now  answers. You see  deaths from natural disasters in the world  you can see it from this graph here  from      to     . In       there was about half a million people who died every year from natural disasters  floods  earthquakes  volcanic  eruption  whatever  droughts. And then  how did that change  Gapminder asked the public in Sweden. This is how they answered. The Swedish public answered like this  Fifty percent thought it had doubled     percent said it's more or less the same     said it had halved. This is the best data from the disaster researchers  and it goes up and down  and it goes to the Second World War  and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling and it's down to much less than half. The world has been much  much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this  you know. So only    percent of the Swedes know this. So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps. The chimps don't watch the evening news  so the chimps  they choose by random  so the Swedes answer worse than random. Now how did you do  That's you. You were beaten by the chimps. But it was close. You were three times better than the Swedes  but that's not enough. You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes. You must have higher ambitions in the world. Let's look at the next answer here  women in school. Here  you can see men went eight years. How long did women go to school  Well  we asked the Swedes like this  and that gives you a hint  doesn't it  The right answer is probably the one the fewest Swedes picked  isn't it  Let's see  let's see. Here we come. Yes  yes  yes  women have almost caught up. This is the U.S. public. And this is you. Here you come. Ooh. Well  congratulations  you're twice as good as the Swedes  but you don't need me   So how come  I think it's like this  that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties. They are stopped when they go to school  and it's disgusting. But in the majority of the world  where most people in the world live  most countries  girls today go to school as long as boys  more or less. That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved  not at all. They still are confined to terrible  terrible limitations  but schooling is there in the world today. Now  we miss the majority. When you answer  you answer according to the worst places  and there you are right  but you miss the majority. What about poverty  Well  it's very clear that poverty here was almost halved  and in U.S.  when we asked the public  only five percent got it right. And you  Ah  you almost made it to the chimps. That little  just a few of you  There must be preconceived ideas  you know. And many in the rich countries  they think that oh  we can never end extreme poverty. Of course they think so  because they don't even know what has happened. The first thing to think about the future is to know about the present. These questions were a few of the first ones in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project in Gapminder Foundation that we run  and it was started  this project  last year by my boss  and also my son  Ola Rosling.  Laughter  He's cofounder and director  and he wanted  Ola told me we have to be more systematic when we fight devastating ignorance. So already the pilots reveal this  that so many in the public score worse than random  so we have to think about preconceived ideas  and one of the main preconceived ideas is about world income distribution. Look here. This is how it was in     . It's the number of people on each income  from one dollar a day   See  there was one hump here  around one dollar a day  and then there was one hump here somewhere between    and     dollars. The world was two groups. It was a camel world  like a camel with two humps  the poor ones and the rich ones  and there were fewer in between. But look how this has changed  As I go forward  what has changed  the world population has grown  and the humps start to merge. The lower humps merged with the upper hump  and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world with one hump only. The percent in poverty has decreased. Still it's appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty. We still have this group  almost a billion  over there  but that can be ended now. The challenge we have now is to get away from that  understand where the majority is  and that is very clearly shown in this question. We asked  what is the percentage of the world's one year old children who have got those basic vaccines against measles and other things that we have had for many years         or    percent  Now  this is what the U.S. public and the Swedish answered. Look at the Swedish result  you know what the right answer is. Who the heck is a professor of global health in that country  Well  it's me. It's me. It's very difficult  this. It's very difficult. However  Ola's approach to really measure what we know made headlines  and CNN published these results on their web and they had the questions there  millions answered  and I think there were about       comments  and this was one of the comments.  I bet no member of the media passed the test   he said. So Ola told me   Take these devices. You are invited to media conferences. Give it to them and measure what the media know.  And ladies and gentlemen  for the first time  the informal results from a conference with U.S. media. And then  lately  from the European Union media. You see  the problem is not that people don't read and listen to the media. The problem is that the media doesn't know themselves. What shall we do about this  Ola  Do we have any ideas  Ola Rosling  Yes  I have an idea  but first  I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps. Fortunately  I will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault  actually. Then  I will equip you with some tricks for beating the chimps in the future. That's basically what I will do. But first  let's look at why are we so ignorant  and it all starts in this place. It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden. It's a neighborhood where I grew up  and it's a neighborhood with a large problem. Actually  it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods where you grew up as well. It was not representative. Okay  It gave me a very biased view of how life is on this planet. So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle. We have a personal bias. We have all different experiences from communities and people we meet  and on top of this  we start school  and we add the next problem. Well  I like schools  but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews  because they learned something when they went to school  and now they describe this world to the students without any bad intentions  and those books  of course  that are printed are outdated in a world that changes. And there is really no practice to keep the teaching material up to date. So that's what we are focusing on. So we have these outdated facts added on top of our personal bias. What happens next is news  okay  An excellent journalist knows how to pick the story that will make headlines  and people will read it because it's sensational. Unusual events are more interesting  no  And they are exaggerated  and especially things we're afraid of. A shark attack on a Swedish person will get headlines for weeks in Sweden. So these three skewed sources of information were really hard to get away from. They kind of bombard us and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas  and on top of it we put the very thing that makes us humans  our human intuition. It was good in evolution. It helped us generalize and jump to conclusions very  very fast. It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of  and we seek causality where there is none  and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers  above the average. Everybody answered that question   Yeah  I drive cars better.  Okay  this was good evolutionarily  but now when it comes to the worldview  it is the exact reason why it's upside down. The trends that are increasing are instead falling  and the other way around  and in this case  the chimps use our intuition against us  and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength. It was supposed to be our strength  wasn't it  So how do we solve such problems  First  we need to measure it  and then we need to cure it. So by measuring it we can understand what is the pattern of ignorance. We started the pilot last year  and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter a lot of ignorance across the whole world  and the idea is really to scale it up to all domains or dimensions of global development  such as climate  endangered species  human rights  gender equality  energy  finance. All different sectors have facts  and there are organizations trying to spread awareness about these facts. So I've started actually contacting some of them  like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF  and asking them  what are your favorite facts which you think the public doesn't know  Okay  I gather those facts. Imagine a long list with  say      facts. And then we poll the public and see where they score worst. So we get a shorter list with the terrible results  like some few examples from Hans  and we have no problem finding these kinds of terrible results. Okay  this little shortlist  what are we going to do with it  Well  we turn it into a knowledge certificate  a global knowledge certificate  which you can use  if you're a large organization  a school  a university  or maybe a news agency  to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable. Basically meaning  we don't hire people who score like chimpanzees. Of course you shouldn't. So maybe    years from now  if this project succeeds  you will be sitting in an interview having to fill out this crazy global knowledge. So now we come to the practical tricks. How are you going to succeed  There is  of course  one way  which is to sit down late nights and learn all the facts by heart by reading all these reports. That will never happen  actually. Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen. People don't have that time. People like shortcuts  and here are the shortcuts. We need to turn our intuition into strength again. We need to be able to generalize. So now I'm going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around into rules of thumb. Let's start with the first misconception. This is very widespread. Everything is getting worse. You heard it. You thought it yourself. The other way to think is  most things improve. So you're sitting with a question in front of you and you're unsure. You should guess  improve.  Okay  Don't go for the worse. That will help you score better on our tests. That was the first one. There are rich and poor and the gap is increasing. It's a terrible inequality. Yeah  it's an unequal world  but when you look at the data  it's one hump. Okay  If you feel unsure  go for  the most people are in the middle.  That's going to help you get the answer right. Now  the next preconceived idea is first countries and people need to be very  very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters. No  no  no. That's wrong. Look  that huge hump in the middle already have girls in school. So if you are unsure  go for the  the majority already have this   like electricity and girls in school  these kinds of things. They're only rules of thumb  so of course they don't apply to everything  but this is how you can generalize. Let's look at the last one. If something  yes  this is a good one  sharks are dangerous. No   well  yes  but they are not so important in the global statistics  that is what I'm saying. I actually  I'm very afraid of sharks. So as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of  which might be earthquakes  other religions  maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks  anything that makes me feel  assume you're going to exaggerate the problem. That's a rule of thumb. Of course there are dangerous  things that are also great. Sharks kill very  very few. That's how you should think. With these four rules of thumb  you could probably answer better than the chimps  because the chimps cannot do this. They cannot generalize these kinds of rules. And hopefully we can turn your world around and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay  That's a systematic approach. Now the question  is this important  Yeah  it's important to understand poverty  extreme poverty and how to fight it  and how to bring girls in school. When we realize that actually it's succeeding  we can understand it. But is it important for everyone else who cares about the rich end of this scale  I would say yes  extremely important  for the same reason. If you have a fact based worldview of today  you might have a chance to understand what's coming next in the future. We're going back to these two humps in     . That's when I was born  and I selected the West. That's the current EU countries and North America. Let's now see how the rest and the West compares in terms of how rich you are. These are the people who can afford to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation. In       only    percent of them lived outside EU and North America. But this has changed  okay  So first  let's look at the change up till today      . Today it's      . The Western domination is over  as of today. That's nice. So what's going to happen next  Do you see the big hump  Did you see how it moved  I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF  International Monetary Fund  website. They have a forecast for the next  five years of GDP per capita. So I can use that to go five years into the future  assuming the income inequality  of each country is the same. I did that  but I went even further. I used those five years for the next    years with the same speed  just as an  experiment what might actually happen. Let's move into the future. In       it's    percent in the rest. In          percent.         . And in       the West is  outnumbered in the rich consumer market. These are just projections of  GDP per capita into the future. Seventy three percent of the rich consumers are going to live outside North America and Europe. So yes  I think it's a good idea for  a company to use this certificate to make sure to make fact  based decisions in the future. Thank you very much. Bruno Giussani  Hans and Ola Rosling  Good afternoon. My name is Uldus. I am a photo based artist from Russia. I started my way around six years ago with ironic self portraits to lay open so many stereotypes about nationalities  genders  and social issues     I am Russian. I sell drugs  guns  porno with kids      Vodka   water. I love vodka     Laughter    using photography as my tool to send a message.   Marry me  I need a visa.   Today  I am still performing in front of the camera and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman. I focus on balancing meaningful message  aesthetic  beauty  composition   some irony  and artifacts. Today  I'm going to tell you about my project  which is named Desperate Romantics. They're my artifacts  or paintings from pre Raphaelites Brotherhood England mid   th century. I took the painting and gifted new  contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia  capturing people who are non models but have an interesting story. This boy is a professional dancer  only    years old  but at secondary school  he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality  trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality. But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted  because being different isn't easy  especially in Russia. Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric. And this is Nikita  a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg. He likes to say   You wouldn't like me when I'm angry   quoting Hulk from the movie  but I've never seen him angry. He hides his sensitivities and romantic side  because in Russia  among guys  that's not cool to be romantic  but it's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk. Sometimes  in my project  I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it. Sometimes  I would compare facial features and playing with words  irony  Iron Man  ironing man. Through the artifacts  I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation. Interesting fact about marriage in Russia  that most of the        year old girls are already ready  and dream to get married. We're taught from childhood  successful marriage means successful life  so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband. And what about me  I'm    years old. For Russian society  I'm an old maid and hopeless to ever get married. That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask  in the wedding dress  all desperate in my garden. But remember  irony is the key  and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals  for dreams  and change stereotypes. Be brave. Be ironic   it helps. Be funny and create some magic. For over a decade as a doctor  I've cared for homeless veterans  for working class families. I've cared for people who  live and work in conditions that can be hard  if not harsh  and that work has led me to believe that we need a fundamentally different way of looking at healthcare. We simply need a healthcare system that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms that bring people into clinics  but instead actually is able to look and improve health where it begins. And where health begins is not in the four walls of a doctor's office  but where we live and where we work  where we eat  sleep  learn and play  where we spend the majority of our lives. So what does this different  approach to healthcare look like  an approach that can improve health where it begins  To illustrate this  I'll tell you about Veronica. Veronica was the   th patient out of my    patient day at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles. She came into our clinic with a chronic headache. This headache had been going on for a number of years  and this particular episode was very  very troubling. In fact  three weeks before she came to visit us for the first time  she went to an  emergency room in Los Angeles. The emergency room doctors said   We've run some tests  Veronica. The results are normal  so here's some pain medication  and follow up with a primary care doctor  but if the pain persists or if it worsens  then come on back.  Veronica followed those standard instructions and she went back. She went back not just once  but twice more. In the three weeks before Veronica met us  she went to the emergency room three times. She went back and forth  in and out of hospitals and clinics  just like she had done in years past  trying to seek relief but still coming up short. Veronica came to our clinic  and despite all these encounters with healthcare professionals  Veronica was still sick. When she came to our clinic  though   we tried a different approach. Our approach started with our medical assistant  someone who had a GED level training but knew the community. Our medical assistant asked some routine questions. She asked   What's your chief complaint    Headache.   Let's get your vital signs    measure your blood pressure and your heart rate  but let's also ask something equally as vital to Veronica and a lot of patients like her in South Los Angeles.  Veronica  can you tell me about where you live  Specifically  about your housing conditions  Do you have mold  Do you have water leaks  Do you have roaches in your home   Turns out  Veronica said yes to three of those things  roaches  water leaks  mold. I received that chart in hand  reviewed it  and I turned the handle on the door and I entered the room. You should understand that Veronica  like a lot of patients that I have the privilege of caring for  is a dignified person  a formidable presence  a personality that's larger than life  but here she was doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table. Her head  clearly throbbing  was resting in her hands. She lifted her head up  and I saw her face  said hello  and then I immediately noticed something across the bridge of her nose  a crease in her skin. In medicine  we call that crease the allergic salute. It's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies. It comes from chronically rubbing one's nose up and down  trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms  and yet  here was Veronica  a grown woman  with the same telltale sign of allergies. A few minutes later  in asking Veronica some questions  and examining her and listening to her  I said   Veronica  I think I know what you have. I think you have chronic allergies  and I think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion  and I think all of those are  related to where you live.  She looked a little bit relieved  because for the first time  she had a diagnosis  but I said   Veronica  now let's talk about your treatment. We're going to order some medications for your symptoms  but I also want to refer you to a specialist  if that's okay.  Now  specialists are a little hard to find in South Central Los Angeles  so she gave me this look  like   Really   And I said   Veronica  actually  the specialist I'm talking about is someone I call a community health worker  someone who  if it's okay with you  can come to your home and try to understand what's going on with those water leaks and that mold  trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms  and if required  that specialist might refer you to another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer  because it might be that your landlord isn't making the fixes he's required to make.  Veronica came back in a few months later. She agreed to all of those treatment plans. She told us that her symptoms had improved by    percent. She was spending more time at work and with her family and less time shuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of Los Angeles. Veronica had improved remarkably. Her sons  one of whom had asthma  were no longer as sick as they used to be. She had gotten better  and not coincidentally  Veronica's home was better too. What was it about this different approach we tried that led to better care  fewer visits to the E.R.  better health  Well  quite simply  it started with that question   Veronica  where do you live   But more importantly  it was that we put in place a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions to Veronica and hundreds more like her about the conditions that mattered in her community  about where health  and unfortunately sometimes illness  do begin in places like South L.A. In that community  substandard housing and food insecurity are the major conditions that we as a clinic had to be aware of  but in other communities it could be transportation barriers  obesity  access to parks  gun violence. The important thing is  we put in place a system that worked  and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach. It's a term many of you are familiar with. It comes from a parable that's very common in the public health community. This is a parable of three friends. Imagine that you're one of these three friends who come to a river. It's a beautiful scene  but it's shattered by the cries of a child  and actually several children  in need of rescue in the water. So you do hopefully what everybody would do. You jump right in along with your friends. The first friend says  I'm going to rescue those who are about to drown  those at most risk of falling over the waterfall. The second friends says  I'm going to build a raft. I'm going to make sure that fewer people need to end up at the waterfall's edge. Let's usher more people to safety by building this raft  coordinating those branches together. Over time  they're successful  but not really  as much as they want to be. More people slip through  and they finally look up and they see that their third friend is nowhere to be seen. They finally spot her. She's in the water. She's swimming away from them upstream  rescuing children as she goes  and they shout to her   Where are you going  There are children here to save.  And she says back   I'm going to find out who or what is throwing these children in the water.  In healthcare  we have that first friend   we have the specialist  we have the trauma surgeon  the ICU nurse  the E.R. doctors. We have those people that are vital rescuers  people you want to be there when you're in dire straits. We also know that we have the second friend   we have that raft builder. That's the primary care clinician  people on the care team who are there to manage your chronic conditions  your diabetes  your hypertension  there to give you your annual checkups  there to make sure your vaccines are up to date  but also there to make sure that you have a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety. But while that's also vital and very necessary  what we're missing is that third friend. We don't have enough of that upstreamist. The upstreamists are the health care professionals who know that health does begin where we live and work and play  but beyond that awareness  is able to mobilize the resources to create the system in their clinics and in their hospitals that really does start to approach that  to connect people to the resources they need outside the four walls of the clinic. Now you might ask  and it's  a very obvious question that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask   Doctors and nurses thinking about transportation and housing  Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures and just make sure we focus on the task at hand   Certainly  rescuing people at the water's edge is important enough work. Who has the time  I would argue  though  that if we were to use science as our guide  that we would find an upstream approach is absolutely necessary. Scientists now know that the living and working conditions that we all are part of have more than twice the impact on our health than does our genetic code  and living and working conditions  the structures of our environments  the ways in which our social fabric is woven together  and the impact those have on our behaviors  all together  those have more than five times the impact on our health than do all the pills and procedures administered by doctors and hospitals combined. All together  living and working conditions account for    percent of preventable death. Let me give you an example of what this feels like. Let's say there was a company  a tech startup that came to you and said   We have a great product. It's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease.  Now  you might be likely to invest if that product was a drug or a device  but what if that product was a park  A study in the U.K.  a landmark study that reviewed the records of over    million residents in the U.K.  looked at several variables  controlled for a lot of factors  and found that when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease  one's exposure to green space was a powerful influence. The closer you were to green space  to parks and trees  the lower your chance of heart disease  and that stayed true for rich and for poor. That study illustrates what my friends in public health often say these days  that one's zip code matters more than your genetic code. We're also learning that zip code is actually shaping our genetic code. The science of epigenetics looks at those molecular mechanisms  those intricate ways in which our DNA is literally shaped  genes turned on and off based on the exposures to the environment  to where we live and to where we work. So it's clear that these factors  these upstream issues  do matter. They matter to our health  and therefore our healthcare professionals should do something about it. And yet  Veronica asked me perhaps the most compelling question I've been asked in a long time. In that follow up visit  she said   Why did none of my doctors ask about my home before  In those visits to the emergency room  I had two CAT scans  I had a needle placed in the lower part of my back to collect spinal fluid  I had nearly a dozen blood tests. I went back and forth  I saw all sorts of people in healthcare  and no one asked about my home.  The honest answer is that in healthcare  we often treat symptoms without addressing the conditions that make you sick in the first place. And there are many reasons for that  but the big three are first  we don't pay for that. In healthcare  we often pay  for volume and not value. We pay doctors and hospitals usually for the number of services they provide  but not necessarily on how healthy they make you. That leads to a second phenomenon that I call the  don't ask  don't tell  approach to upstream issues in healthcare. We don't ask about where you live and where you work  because if there's a problem there  we don't know what to tell you. It's not that doctors don't know these are important issues. In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians  over       physicians     percent of them actually said that they know that their patients' upstream problems are as important as their health issues  as their medical problems  and yet despite that widespread awareness of the importance of upstream issues  only one in five doctors said they had any sense of confidence to address those issues  to improve health where it begins. There's this gap between knowing that patients' lives  the context of where they live and work  matters  and the ability to do something about it in the systems in which we work. This is a huge problem right now  because it leads them to this next question  which is  whose responsibility is it  And that brings me to that third point  that third answer to Veronica's compelling question. Part of the reason that we have this conundrum is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists in the healthcare system. There are not nearly enough of that third friend  that person who is going to find out who or what is throwing those kids in the water. Now  there are many upstreamists  and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them  in Los Angeles and in other parts of the country and around the world  and it's important to note that upstreamists sometimes are doctors  but they need not be. They can be nurses  other clinicians  care managers  social workers. It's not so important what specific degree upstreamists have at the end of their name. What's more important is that they all seem to share the same ability to implement a process that transforms their assistance  transforms the way they practice medicine. That process is a quite simple process. It's one  two and three. First  they sit down and they say  let's identify the clinical problem among a certain set of patients. Let's say  for instance  let's try to help children who are bouncing in and out of the hospital with asthma. After identifying the problem  they  then move on to that second step  and they say  let's identify the root cause. Now  a root cause analysis  in healthcare  usually says  well  let's look at your genes  let's look at how you're behaving. Maybe you're not eating healthy enough. Eat healthier. It's a pretty simplistic approach to root cause analyses. It turns out  it doesn't really work when we just limit ourselves that worldview. The root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings to the table is to say  let's look at the living and the working conditions in your life. Perhaps  for children with asthma  it's what's happening in their home  or perhaps they live close to a freeway with major air pollution that triggers their asthma. And perhaps that's what we should mobilize our resources to address  because that third element  that third part of the process  is that next critical part of what upstreamists do. They mobilize the resources to create a solution  both within the clinical system  and then by bringing in people from public health  from other sectors  lawyers  whoever is willing to play ball  let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense  to take those patients who actually have clinical problems and address their root causes together by linking them to the resources you need. It's clear to me that there are so many stories of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things. The problem is that there's just not nearly enough of them out there. By some estimates  we need one upstreamist for every    to    clinicians in the healthcare system. In the U.S.  for instance  that would mean that we need        upstreamists by the year     . But we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now  by all accounts  and that's why  a few years ago  my colleagues and I said  you know what  we need to train and make more upstreamists. So we decided to start an organization called Health Begins  and Health Begins simply does that  We train upstreamists. And there are a lot of measures that we use for our success  but the main thing that we're interested in is making sure that we're changing the sense of confidence  that  don't ask  don't tell  metric among clinicians. We're trying to make sure that clinicians  and therefore their systems that they work in have the ability  the confidence to address the problems in the living and working conditions in our lives. We're seeing nearly a tripling of that confidence in our work. It's remarkable  but I'll tell you the most compelling part of what it means to be working with upstreamists to gather them together. What is most compelling is that every day  every week  I hear stories just like Veronica's. There are stories out there of Veronica and many more like her  people who are coming to the healthcare system and getting a glimpse of what it feels like to be part of something that works  a health care system that stops bouncing you back and forth but actually improves your health  listens to you who you are  addresses the context of your life  whether you're rich or poor or middle class. These stories are compelling because not only do they tell us that we're this close to getting the healthcare system that we want  but that there's something that we can all do to get there. Doctors and nurses can get better at asking about the context of patients' lives  not simply because it's better bedside manner  but frankly  because it's a better standard of care. Healthcare systems and payers can start to bring in public health agencies and departments and say  let's look at our data together. Let's see if we can discover some patterns in our data about our patients' lives and see if we can identify an upstream cause  and then  as importantly  can we align the resources to be able to address them  Medical schools  nursing schools  all sorts of health professional education programs can help by training the next generation of upstreamists. We can also make sure that these schools certify a backbone of the upstream approach  and that's the community health worker. We need many more of them in the healthcare system if we're truly going to have it be effective  to move from a sickcare system to a healthcare system. But finally  and perhaps most importantly  what do we do  What do we do as patients  We can start by simply going to our doctors and our nurses  to our clinics  and asking   Is there something in where I live and where I work that I should be aware of   Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of  and more importantly  if there are barriers that I'm surfacing  if I'm coming to you and I'm saying I think have a problem with my apartment or at my workplace or I don't have access to transportation  or there's a park that's way too far  so sorry doctor  I can't take your advice to go and jog  if those problems exist  then doctor  are you willing to listen  And what can we do together to improve my health where it begins  If we're all able to do this work  doctors and healthcare systems  payers  and all of us together  we'll realize something about health. Health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon. Health is a common good. It comes from our personal investment in knowing that our lives matter  the context of where we live and where we work  eat  and sleep  matter  and that what we do for ourselves  we also should do for those whose living and working conditions again  can be hard  if not harsh. We can all invest in making sure that we improve the allocation of resources upstream  but at the same time work together and show that we can move healthcare upstream. We can improve health where it begins. Thank you. So in       an English composer  technologist and astronomer called William Herschel noticed an object on the sky that didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did. And Herschel's recognition that something was different  that something wasn't quite right  was the discovery of a planet  the planet Uranus  a name that has entertained countless generations of children  but a planet that overnight doubled the size of our known solar system. Just last month  NASA announced the discovery of     new planets in orbit around nearby stars  almost doubling overnight the number of planets we know about within our galaxy. So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this capacity to collect data  and with data almost doubling every year  within the next two decades  me may even reach the point for the first time in history where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies within the universe. But as we enter this era of big data  what we're beginning to find is there's a difference between more data being just better and more data being different  capable of changing the questions we want to ask  and this difference is not about how much data we collect  it's whether those data open new windows into our universe  whether they change the way we view the sky. So what is the next window into our universe  What is the next chapter for astronomy  Well  I'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies that we're going to develop over the next decade  and how these technologies  together with the smart use of data  may once again transform astronomy by opening up a window into our universe  the window of time. Why time  Well  time is about origins  and it's about evolution. The origins of our solar system  how our solar system came into being  is it unusual or special in any way  About the evolution of our universe. Why our universe is continuing to expand  and what is this mysterious dark energy that drives that expansion  But first  I want to show you how technology is going to change the way we view the sky. So imagine if you were sitting in the mountains of northern Chile looking out to the west towards the Pacific Ocean a few hours before sunrise. This is the view of the night sky that you would see  and it's a beautiful view  with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon. but it's also a static view  and in many ways  this is the way we think of our universe  eternal and unchanging. But the universe is anything but static. It constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years. Galaxies merge  they collide at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. Stars are born  they die  they explode in these extravagant displays. In fact  if we could go back to our tranquil skies above Chile  and we allow time to move forward to see how the sky might change over the next year  the pulsations that you see are supernovae  the final remnants of a dying star exploding  brightening and then fading from view  each one of these supernovae five billion times the brightness of our sun  so we can see them to great distances but only for a short amount of time. Ten supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe. If we could hear it  it would be popping like a bag of popcorn. Now  if we fade out the supernovae  it's not just brightness that changes. Our sky is in constant motion. This swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun  and it's these changes and the motion and it's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe  to predict its future and to explain its past. But the telescopes we've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at this scale. The Hubble Space Telescope  for the last    years it's been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe  but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image of the sky  it would take    million individual images  about     years to do this just once. So this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes  telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe but also telescopes that can go wide to capture the sky as rapidly as possible  telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope  or the LSST  possibly the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy  in fact proof  if you should need it  that you should never allow  a scientist or an engineer to name anything  not even your children.  Laughter  We're building the LSST. We expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade. I'm going to show you how we think it's going to transform  our views of the universe  because one image from the LSST is equivalent to       images from the Hubble Space Telescope  each image three and a half degrees on the sky  seven times the width of the full moon. Well  how do you capture an image at this scale  Well  you build the largest digital camera in history  using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you  can buy in the High Street  but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across  about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle  where one image is three billion pixels. So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution  just a single LSST image  it would take about        high definition TV screens. And this camera will image the sky  taking a new picture every    seconds  constantly scanning the sky so every three nights  we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile. Over the mission lifetime of this telescope  it will detect    billion stars and galaxies  and that will be for the first time we'll have detected more objects in our universe than people on the Earth. Now  we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects  but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded simultaneously     hours a day  seven days a week  for    years. And to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept  looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next. And this is changing the way that we do science  changing the way that we do astronomy  to a place where software and algorithms have to mine through this data  where the software is as critical to the science as the telescopes and the  cameras that we've built. Now  thousands of discoveries will come from this project  but I'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access to data at this scale. In the last five years  NASA has discovered over       planetary systems around nearby stars  but the systems we're finding aren't much like our own solar system  and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough or is there something special or unusual about how our solar system formed  And if we want to answer that question  we have to know and understand the history of our solar system in detail  and it's the details that are crucial. So now  if we look back at the sky  at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky  these asteroids are like the debris of our solar system. The positions of the asteroids are like a fingerprint of an earlier time when the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter were much closer to the sun  and as these giant planets migrated through our solar system  they were scattering the asteroids in their wake. So studying the asteroids is like performing forensics  performing forensics on our solar system  but to do this  we need distance  and we get the distance from the motion  and we get the motion because of our access to time. So what does this tell us  Well  if you look at the little yellow asteroids flitting across the screen  these are the asteroids that are moving fastest  because they're closest to us  closest to Earth. These are the asteroids we may one day send spacecraft to  to mine them for minerals  but they're also the asteroids that may one day impact the Earth  like happened    million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs  or just at the beginning of the last century  when an asteroid wiped out almost       square miles of Siberian forest  or even just last year  as one burnt up over Russia  releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb. So studying the forensics of our solar system doesn't just tell us about the past  it can also predict the future   including our future. Now when we get distance  we get to see the asteroids  in their natural habitat  in orbit around the sun. So every point in this visualization that you can see is a real asteroid. Its orbit has been calculated from its motion across the sky. The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids  dry and stony in the center  water rich and primitive towards the edge  water rich asteroids which may have seeded the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet when they bombarded the  Earth at an earlier time. Because the LSST will be able to go faint and not just wide  we will be able to see these asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system  to asteroids beyond the  orbits of Neptune and Mars  to comets and asteroids that may exist almost a light year from our sun. And as we increase the detail of this picture  increasing the detail by factors of    to      we will be able to answer questions such as  is there evidence for planets outside the orbit of Neptune  to find Earth impacting asteroids long before they're a danger  and to find out whether  maybe  our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars  and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings that influenced the formation of our solar system  and maybe that's one of the reasons why  solar systems like ours seem to be so rare. Now  distance and changes in our universe   distance equates to time  as well as changes on the sky. Every foot of distance you look away  or every foot of distance an object is away  you're looking back about a billionth of a second in time  and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe  not once but multiple times. The first time was in       when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble showed that the universe was expanding  leading to the ideas of the Big Bang. And the observations were simple  just    galaxies and a hand drawn picture. But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy  the faster it was receding  was enough to give rise to modern cosmology. A second revolution happened    years later  when two groups of astronomers showed that the universe wasn't just expanding  it was accelerating  a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky and finding out the higher that it gets  the faster it moves away. And they showed this by measuring the brightness of supernovae  and how the brightness of the supernovae got fainter with distance. And these observations were more complex. They required new technologies and new telescopes  because the supernovae were in galaxies that were       times more distant than the ones used by Hubble. And it took three years to find just    supernovae  because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy. Three years to find    supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies. And once they'd collected their data  this is what they found. Now  this may not look impressive  but this is what a revolution in physics looks like  a line predicting the brightness of a supernova    billion light years away  and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line. Small changes give rise to big consequences. Small changes allow us to make discoveries  like the planet found by Herschel. Small changes turn our understanding of the universe on its head. So    supernovae  slightly too faint  meaning slightly further away  requiring that a universe must not just be expanding  but this expansion must be accelerating  revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy  a component that drives this expansion and makes up    percent of the energy budget of our universe today. So what is the next revolution likely to be  Well  what is dark energy and why does it exist  Each of these lines shows a different model for what dark energy might be  showing the properties of dark energy. They all are consistent with the    points  but the ideas behind these lines are dramatically different. Some people think about a dark energy that changes with time  or whether the properties of the dark energy are different depending on where you look on the sky. Others make differences and changes to the physics at the sub atomic level. Or  they look at large scales and change how gravity and general relativity work  or they say our universe is just one of many  part of this mysterious multiverse  but all of these ideas  all of these theories  amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy  but all of them consistent with our    points. So how can we hope to make sense of this over the next decade  Well  imagine if I gave you a pair of dice  and I said you wanted to see whether those dice were loaded or fair. One roll of the dice would tell you very little  but the more times you rolled them  the more data you collected  the more confident you would become  not just whether they're loaded or fair  but by how much  and in what way. It took three years to find just    supernovae because the telescopes that we built could only survey a small part of the sky. With the LSST  we get a completely new view of the skies above Chile every three nights. In its first night of operation  it will find    times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy. This will increase by       within the first four months   .  million supernovae by the end of its survey  each supernova a roll of the dice  each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent  and which ones are not. And so  by combining these supernova data with other measures of cosmology  we'll progressively rule out the different ideas and theories of dark energy until hopefully at the end of this survey around       we would expect to hopefully see a theory for our universe  a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe  to gradually emerge. Now  in many ways  the questions that I posed are in reality the simplest of questions. We may not know the answers  but we at least know how to ask the questions. But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies revealed    supernovae that turned our understanding of the universe on its head  when we're working with billions of galaxies  how many more times are we going to find    points that don't quite match what we expect  Like the planet found by Herschel or dark energy or quantum mechanics or general relativity  all ideas that came because the data didn't quite match what we expected. What's so exciting about the next decade of data in astronomy is  we don't even know how many answers are out there waiting  answers about our origins and our evolution. How many answers are out there that we don't even know the questions that we want to ask  Thank you. Hi everybody. So my name is Mac. My job is that I lie to children  but they're honest lies. I write children's books  and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso   We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is  given us to understand. The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the  truthfulness of his lies.  I first heard this when I was a kid  and I loved it  but I had no idea what it meant. So I thought  you know what  it's what I'm here to talk to you today about  though  truth and lies  fiction and reality. So how could I untangle this knotted bunch of sentences  And I said  I've got PowerPoint. Let's do a Venn diagram.   Truth. Lies.    Laughter  So there it is  right there  boom. We've got truth and lies and then there's this little space  the edge  in the middle. That liminal space  that's art. All right. Venn diagram.  Laughter   Applause  But that's actually not very helpful either. The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art  at least the art of fiction  was  was working with kids. I used to be a summer camp counselor. I would do it on my summers off from college  and I loved it. It was a sports summer camp for four  to six year olds. I was in charge of the four year olds  which is good  because four year olds can't play  sports  and neither can I. I play sports at a four year old level  so what would happen is the kids would dribble around some cones  and then got hot  and then they would go sit underneath the tree where I was already sitting    Laughter    and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life. I would tell them about how  on the weekends  I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England. And soon  other kids who weren't even in my group of kids  they would come up to me  and they would say   You're Mac Barnett  right  You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England.  And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question. In my fantasy  they were svelte Russian women  but  you know  four year olds   you take what you can get in Berkeley  California. And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting. I think the pinnacle of this for  me   I'll never forget this   there was this little girl  named Riley. She was tiny  and she used to always take  out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit. She would just take her fruit  her mom packed her a melon every day  and she would just throw it in the ivy and then she would eat fruit snacks and pudding cups  and I was like   Riley  you can't do that  you  have to eat the fruit.  And she was like   Why   And I was like   Well  when you throw the fruit in the ivy  pretty soon  it's going to be overgrown with melons   which is why I think I ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children. And so Riley was like   That will never happen. That's not going to happen.  And so  on the last day of camp  I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy  and then at lunchtime  I was like   Riley  why don't you go over there and see what you've done.  And    Laughter    she went trudging through  the ivy  and then her eyes just got so wide  and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head  and then all the kids ran over  there and rushed around her  and one of the kids was like   Hey  why is there a sticker on this   And I was like   That is also why I say do not throw your stickers in the ivy. Put them in the trash can. It ruins nature when you do this.  And Riley carried that melon around with her all day  and she was so proud. And Riley knew she didn't  grow a melon in seven days  but she also knew that she did  and it's a weird place  but it's not just a place that kids can get to. It's anything. Art can get us to that place. She was right in that place in the middle  that place which you could call art or fiction. I'm going to call it wonder. It's what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief or poetic faith  for those moments where a story  no matter how strange  has some semblance of the truth  and then you're able to believe it. It's not just kids who can get there. Adults can too  and we get there when we read. It's why in two days  people will be descending on Dublin to take the walking tour of Bloomsday and see everything that happened in  Ulysses   even though none of that happened. Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment  even though    B is just a number that was painted on a building that never  actually had that address. We know these characters aren't real  but we have real feelings about them  and we're able to do that. We know these characters aren't real  and yet we also know that they are. Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can  and that's why I love writing for kids. I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction. When I was a kid  I was obsessed with secret door novels  things like  Narnia   where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land. And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist and I would look for them and try to go through them. I wanted to live and cross over into  that fictional world  which is   I would always just open people's closet doors.   Laughter  I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet  and there was not a secret magical land there. There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about. And I was happy to tell her all about it. After college  my first job was working behind one of these secret doors. This is a place called     Valencia. It's at     Valencia Street in the Mission in San Francisco  and when I worked there  there was a publishing company headquartered there called McSweeney's  a nonprofit writing center called     Valencia  but then the front of it was a strange shop. You see  this place was zoned retail  and in San Francisco  they were not going to give us a variance  and so the writer who founded it  a writer named Dave Eggers  to come into compliance  with code  he said   Fine  I'm just going to build a pirate supply store.  And that's what he did.  Laughter  And it's beautiful. It's all wood. There's drawers you can pull out and get citrus so you don't get scurvy. They have eyepatches in lots of colors  because when it's springtime  pirates want to go wild. You don't know. Black is boring. Pastel. Or eyes  also in lots of colors  just glass eyes  depending on how you want to deal with that situation. And the store  strangely  people came to them and bought things  and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center  which was behind it  but to me  more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do  kids would come and get instruction in writing  and when you have to walk this weird  liminal  fictional space like this to go do your writing  it's going to affect the kind of work that you make. It's a secret door that you can walk through. So I ran the     in Los Angeles  and it was my job to build the store down there. So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart. That's our motto   Whenever you are  we're already then.  And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Our friendly staff is ready to help you. They're from all eras  including just the     s  that guy on the end  he's from the very recent past. There's our Employees of the Month  including Genghis Khan  Charles Dickens. Some great people have come up through our ranks. This is our kind of pharmacy section. We have some patent medicines  Canopic jars for your organs  communist soap that says   This is your soap for the year.   Laughter  Our slushy machine broke on the opening night and  we didn't know what to do. Our architect was covered in red syrup. It looked like he had just murdered somebody  which it was not out of the question for this particular architect  and we didn't know what to do. It was going to be the highlight of our store. So we just put that sign on it that said   Out of order. Come back yesterday.   Laughter  And that ended up being a better joke than slushies  so we just left it there forever. Mammoth Chunks. These things weigh  like  seven pounds each. Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad and potpourri   things that barbarians hate. Dead languages. Leeches  nature's tiny doctors. And Viking Odorant  which comes in lots of great scents  toenails  sweat and rotten vegetables  pyre ash. Because we believe that Axe Body Spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield  not under your arms.  Laughter  And these are robot emotion chips  so robots can feel love or fear. Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude  which we did not expect. We did not think that was going to happen. But there's a nonprofit behind it  and kids go through a door that says  Employees Only  and they end up in this space where they do homework and write stories and make films and this is a book release party where kids will read. There's a quarterly that's published with just writing that's done by the kids who come every day after school  and we have release parties and they eat cake and read for their parents and drink milk out of champagne glasses. And it's a very special space  because it's this weird space in the front. The joke isn't a joke. You can't find the seams on the fiction  and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction that's colonized the real world. I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions. There's a term called metafiction  and that's just stories about stories  and meta's having a moment now. Its last big moment was probably in the     s with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis  but it's been around. It's almost as old as storytelling itself. And one metafictive technique is breaking the fourth wall. Right  It's when an actor will turn to the audience and say   I am an actor  these are just rafters.  And even that supposedly honest moment  I would argue  is in service of the lie  but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality of the fiction. For me  I kind of prefer the opposite. If I'm going to break down the fourth wall  I want fiction to escape and come into the real world. I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality. And so I try to do this in my books. And here's just one example. This is the first book that I ever made. It's called  Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem.  And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it's a punishment and it ruins his life. So it's delivered overnight by FedUp. And he has to take it to school with him. He lives in San Francisco   very tough city to own a blue whale in. A lot of hills  real estate is at a premium. This market's crazy  everybody. But underneath the jacket is this case  and that's the cover underneath the book  the jacket  and there's an ad that offers a free    day risk free trial for a blue whale. And you can just send in a self addressed stamped envelope and we'll send you a whale. And kids do write in. So here's a letter. It says   Dear people  I bet you    bucks you won't send me a blue whale. Eliot Gannon  age   .  So what Eliot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm   that says that due to a change in customs laws  their whale has been held up in Sognefjord  which is a very lovely fjord  and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord and Norwegian food for  a little while. It digresses. But it finishes off by saying that your whale would love to hear from you. He's got a phone number  and you can call and leave him a message. And when you call and leave him a message  you just  on the outgoing message  it's just whale sounds and then a beep  which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound. And they get a picture of their whale too. So this is Randolph  and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in  and I'll play you some of Nico's message. This is the first message I ever got from Nico. I am your owner  Randolph. Hello. So this is the first time I can ever talk to you  and I might talk to you soon another day. Bye. Mac Barnett  So Nico called back  like  an hour later. And here's another one of Nico's messages. I haven't talked to you for a long time  but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday  yeah  Saturday or Sunday  so now I'm calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now  and I'm going to probably call you again tomorrow or today  so I'll talk to you later. Bye. MB  So he did  he called back that day again. He's left over    messages for Randolph over four years. You find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that  he likes a little bit less   and the crossword puzzles that he does  and this is   I'll play you one  more message from Nico. This is the Christmas message from Nico.  Beep   Audio  Nico  Hello  Randolph  sorry I haven't talked to you in a long time. It's just that I've been so busy because school started  as you might not know  probably  since you're a whale  you don't know  and I'm calling you to just say  to wish you a merry Christmas. So have a nice Christmas  and bye bye  Randolph. Goodbye. MB  I actually got Nico  I hadn't heard from in    months  and he just left a message two days ago. His voice is completely different  but he put his babysitter on the phone  and she was very nice to Randolph as well. But Nico's the best reader I could hope for. I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create. I feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers  and they deserve the best stories we can give them. Thank you very much. My grandfather was a cobbler. Back in the day  he made custom made shoes. I never got to meet him. He perished in the Holocaust. But I did inherit his love for making  except that it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see  while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity  it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved  and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with  D printing  and it all started with this  the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little older than TED. It was printed in      by Chuck Hull  who invented  D printing. But the thing that I want to talk to you about today  the big idea that I want to discuss with you  is not that  D printing is going to catapult us into the future  but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage  and it's going to usher in a new era of localized  distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So think about useful things. You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples  Anybody  Wouldn't it be awesome if you could  for the first time  get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly  so chances are  the hinges are not going to break  But the implications of  D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time  she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down  but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics  but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure. So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine  a little bit more elegant  and lightweight  and like good tailors  we thought that we would measure her digitally. And we did. We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at  D printing and we say to ourselves  it's going to replace traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said  it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what  She's not standing still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there.  D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them  from new  beautiful  conformal  ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees  another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit here today  you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners  or your dental restorations. Millions of in the ear hearing aids are already  D printed today. Millions of people are served today from these devices. What about full knee replacements  from your data  made to measure  where all of the tools and guides are  D printed  G.E. is using  D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about    percent and cost for an airline of about    million dollars. Good for G.E.  right  And their customers and the environment. But  you know  the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources  a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first  space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship  it costs a fraction of its cost  and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts  and it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone  the Ara. It's only possible because of the development of high speed  D printing that for the first time will make functional  usable modules that will go into it. A real moonshot  powered by  D printing. How about food  What if we could  for the first time  make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here  that are edible  What if we could completely change the experience  like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely  D printed  And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste  which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner  And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about  D printing. With  D printing  complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape  and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that  D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities  and with that  everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer. That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD  so we're developing haptics  perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay. When you do things like that  and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable  it will make it easier to create content  but with all of the unimagined  we will also have the unintended  like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me  will we have a  D printer in every home  I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is  how will  D printing change my life  Or  in other words  what room in my house will  D printing fit in  So everything that you see here has been  D printed  including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now  these are not my grandfather's shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper local manufacturing. My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl  and my father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized  D printed shoes. He passed away three years ago. But Chuck Hull  the man that invented it all  is right here in the house today  and thanks to him  I can say  thanks to his invention  I can say that I am a cobbler too  and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the future. Thank you. What do you guys think  For those who watched Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk  I am a typical example  of what he describes as  the body as a form of transport for the head   a university professor. You might think it was not fair that I've been lined up to speak after these first two talks to speak about science. I can't move my body to the beat  and after a scientist who became a philosopher  I have to talk about hard science. It could be a very dry subject. Yet  I feel honored. Never in my career  and it's been a long career  have I had the opportunity to start a talk feeling so inspired  like this one. Usually  talking about science is like exercising in a dry place. However  I've had the pleasure of being invited to come here to talk about water. The words  water  and  dry  do not match  right  It is even better to talk about water in the Amazon  which is the splendid cradle  of life. Fresh life. So this is what inspired me. That's why I'm here  although I'm carrying my head over here. I am trying  or will try to convey this inspiration. I hope this story will inspire you and that you'll spread the word. We know that there is controversy. The Amazon is the  lung of the world   because of its massive power to have vital gases exchanged between the forest and the atmosphere. We also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity. While many believe it  few know it. If you go out there  in this marsh  you'll be amazed at the    You can barely see the animals. The Indians say   The forest has more eyes than leaves.  That is true  and I will try to show you something. But today  I'm going to use a different approach  one that is inspired by these two initiatives here  a harmonic one and a philosophical one. I'll try to use an approach that's slightly materialistic  but it also attempts to convey that  in nature  there is extraordinary philosophy and harmony. There'll be no music in my presentation  but I hope you'll all notice the music of the reality I'm going to show you. I'm going to talk about physiology   not about lungs  but other analogies with human physiology  especially the heart. We'll start by thinking that water is like blood. The circulation in our body distributes fresh blood  which feeds  nurtures and supports us  and brings the used blood back to be renewed. In the Amazon  things happen similarly. We'll start by talking about the power of all these processes. This is an image of rain in motion. What you see there is the years passing in seconds. Rains all over the world. What do you see  The equatorial region  in general  and the Amazon specifically  is extremely important for the world's climate. It's a powerful engine. There is a frantic evaporation taking place here. If we take a look at this other image  which shows the water vapor flow  you have dry air in black  moist air in gray  and clouds in white. What you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon. What phenomenon    if it's not a desert  what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power  that it can be seen from space  What phenomenon is this  It could be a geyser. A geyser is underground water heated by magma  exploding into the atmosphere and transferring this water  into the atmosphere. There are no geysers in the Amazon  unless I am wrong. I don't know of any. But we have something that plays the same role  with much more elegance though  the trees  our good old friends that  like geysers  can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere. There are     billion trees in the Amazon forest      billion geysers. That is done with an extraordinary sophistication. They don't need the heat of magma. They use sunlight to do this process. So  in a typical sunny day in the Amazon  a big tree manages to transfer       liters of water through its transpiration          liters. If we take all the Amazon  which is a very large area  and add it up to all that water that is released by transpiration  which is the sweat of the forest  we'll get to an incredible number     billion metric tons of water. In one day. Do you know how much that is  The Amazon River  the largest river on Earth  one fifth of all the fresh water that leaves the continents of the whole world and ends up in the oceans  dumps    billion metric tons of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean. This river of vapor that comes up from the forest and goes into the atmosphere is greater than the Amazon River. Just to give you an idea. If we could take a gigantic kettle  the kind you could plug into a power socket  an electric one  and put those    billion metric tons of water in it  how much power would you need to have this water evaporated  Any idea  A really big kettle. A gigantic kettle  right     thousand Itaipus. Itaipu is still the largest hydroelectric plant in the world. and Brazil is very proud of it because it provides more  than    percent of the power that is consumed in Brazil. And the Amazon is here  doing this for free. It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant  providing environmental services. Related to this subject  we are going to talk about what I call the paradox of chance  which is curious. If you look at the world map    it's easy to see this    you'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone  and deserts are organized at    degrees north latitude     degrees south latitude  aligned. Look over there  in the southern hemisphere  the Atacama  Namibia and Kalahari in Africa  the Australian desert. In the northern hemisphere  the Sahara  Sonoran  etc. There is an exception  and it's curious  It's the quadrangle that ranges from Cuiab  to Buenos Aires  and from S o Paulo to the Andes. This quadrangle was supposed to be a desert. It's on the line of deserts. Why isn't it  That's why I call it the paradox of chance. What do we have in South America that is different  If we could use the analogy of the blood circulating in our bodies  like the water circulating in the landscape  we see that rivers are veins  they drain the landscape  they drain the tissue of nature. Where are the arteries  Any guess  What takes    How does water get to irrigate the tissues of nature and bring everything back through rivers  There is a new type of river  which originates in the blue sea  which flows through the green ocean    it not only flows  but it is also pumped by the green ocean    and then it falls on our land. All our economy  that quadrangle     percent of South America's  GDP comes from that area. It depends on this river. This river flows invisibly above us. We are floating here on this floating hotel  on one of the largest rivers on Earth  the Negro River. It's a bit dry and rough  but we are floating here  and there is this invisible river running above us. This river has a pulse. Here it is  pulsing. That's why we also talk about the heart. You can see the different seasons there. There's the rainy season. In the Amazon  we used to have two seasons  the humid season and the even more humid season. Now we have a dry season. You can see the river covering that region which  otherwise  would be a desert. And it is not. We  scientists    You see that I'm struggling here to move my head from one side to the other. Scientists study how it works  why  etc. and these studies are generating a series of discoveries  which are absolutely fabulous  to raise our awareness of the wealth  the complexity  and the wonder that we have  the symphony we have in this process. One of them is  How is rain formed  Above the Amazon  there is clean air  as there is clean air above the ocean. The blue sea has clean air above it and forms pretty few clouds  there's almost no rain there. The green ocean has the same clean air  but forms a lot of rain. What is happening here that is different  The forest emits smells  and these smells are condensation nuclei  which form drops in the atmosphere. Then  clouds are formed and there is torrential rain. The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden. This relation between a living thing  which is the forest  and a nonliving thing  which is the atmosphere  is ingenious in the Amazon  because the forest provides water and seeds  and the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back  guaranteeing the forest's survival. There are other factors as well. We've talked a little about the heart  and let's now talk about another function  the liver  When humid air  high humidity and radiation are combined with these organic compounds  which I call exogenous vitamin C  generous vitamin C in the form of gas  the plants release antioxidants which react with pollutants. You can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air on Earth  here in the Amazon  because the plants take care of this characteristic as well. This benefits the very way plants work  which is another ingenious cycle. Speaking of fractals  and their relation with the way we work  we can establish other comparisons. As in the upper airways of our lungs  the air in the Amazon gets cleaned up from the excess of dust. The dust in the air that we breathe is cleaned by our airways. This keeps the excess of dust from affecting the rainfall. When there are fires in the Amazon  the smoke stops the rain   it stops raining  the forest dries up and catches fire. There is another fractal analogy. Like in the veins and arteries  the rain water is a feedback. It returns to the atmosphere. Like endocrinal glands and hormones  there are those gases which I told you about before  that are formed and released into the atmosphere  like hormones  which help in the formation of rain. Like the liver and the kidneys  as I've said  cleaning the air. And  finally  like the heart  pumping water from outside  from the sea  into the forest. We call it the biotic moisture pump  a new theory that is explained in a very simple way. If there is a desert in the continent with a nearby sea  evaporation's greater on the sea  and it sucks the air above the desert. The desert is trapped in this condition. It will always be dry. If you have the opposite situation  a forest  the evaporation  as we showed  is much greater  because of the trees  and this relation is reversed. The air above the sea is sucked into the continent and humidity is imported. This satellite image was taken one month ago   that's Manaus down there  we're down there   and it shows this process. It's not a common little river that flows into a canal. It's a mighty river that irrigates South America  among other things. This image shows those paths  all the hurricanes that have been recorded. You can see that  in the red square  there hardly are any hurricanes. That is no accident. This pump that sucks the moisture into the continent also speeds up the air above the sea  and this prevents hurricane formations. To close this part and sum up  I'd like to talk about something a little different. I have several colleagues who worked in the development of these theories. They think  and so do I  that we can save planet Earth. I'm not talking only about the Amazon. The Amazon teaches us a lesson on how pristine nature works. We didn't understand these processes before because the rest of the world is messed up. We could understand it here  though. These colleagues propose that  yes  we can save other areas  including deserts. If we could establish forests in those other areas  we can reverse climate change  including global warming. I have a dear colleague in India  whose name is Suprabha Seshan  and she has a motto. Her motto is   Gardening back the biosphere    Reajardinando a biosfera  in Portuguese. She does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems. We need to do this. Having closed this quick introduction  we see the reality that we have out here  which is drought  this climate change  things that we already knew. I'd like to tell you a short story. Once  about four years ago  I attended a declamation  of a text by Davi Kopenawa  a wise representative of the Yanomami people  and it went more or less like this   Doesn't the white man know that  if he destroys the forest  there will be no more rain  And that  if there's no more rain  there'll be nothing to drink  or to eat   I heard that  and my eyes welled up and I went   Oh  my  I've been studying this for    years  with a super computer  dozens  thousands of scientists  and we are starting to get to this conclusion  which he already knows   A critical point is the Yanomami have never deforested. How could they know the rain would end  This bugged me and I was befuddled. How could he know that  Some months later  I met him at another event and said   Davi  how did you know that if the forest was destroyed  there'd be no more rain   He replied   The spirit of the forest told us.  For me  this was a game changer  a radical change. I said   Gosh  Why am I doing all this science to get to a conclusion that he already knows   Then  something  absolutely critical hit me  which is  seeing is believing. Out of sight  out of mind. This is a need the previous speaker pointed out  We need to see things    I mean  we  Western society  which is becoming global  civilized    we need to see. If we don't see  we don't register the information. We live in ignorance. So  I propose the following    of course  the astronomer wouldn't like the idea    but let's turn the Hubble telescope upside down. And let's make it look down here  rather than to the far reaches of the universe. The universe is wonderful  but we have a practical reality  which is we live in an unknown cosmos  and we're ignorant about it. We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos that shelters us and houses us. Talk to any astrophysicist. The Earth is a statistical improbability. The stability and comfort that we enjoy  despite the droughts of the Negro River  and all the heat and cold and typhoons  etc.  there is nothing like it in the universe  that we know of. Then  let's turn Hubble in our direction  and let's look at the Earth. Let's start with the Amazon  Let's dive  let's reach out the reality we live in every day  and look carefully at it  since that's what we need. Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this. He has something already that I think I missed. I was educated by television. I think that I missed this  an ancestral record  a valuation of what I don't know  what I haven't seen. He is not a doubting Thomas. He believes   with veneration and reverence  in what his ancestors and the spirits taught him. We can't do it  so let's look into the forest. Even with Hubble up there    this is a bird's eye view  right  Even when this happens  we also see something that we don't know. The Spanish called it the green inferno. If you go out there into the bushes and get lost  and  let's say  if you head west  it's     kilometers to Colombia  and another       to somewhere else. So  you can figure out why they called it the green inferno. But go and look at what is in there. It is a live carpet. Each color you see is a tree species. Each tree  each tree top  has up to        species of insects in it  let alone the millions of species of fungi  bacteria  etc. All invisible. All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us than the galaxies billions of light years away from the Earth  which Hubble brings to our newspapers everyday. I'm going to end my talk here    I have a few seconds left    by showing you this wonderful being. When we see the morpho butterfly in the forest  we feel like someone's left open the door to heaven  and this creature escaped from there  because it's so beautiful. However  I cannot finish without showing you a tech side. We are tech arrogant. We deprive nature of its technology. A robotic hand is technological  mine is biological  and we don't think about it anymore. Let's then look at the morpho butterfly  an example of an invisible technological competence of life  which is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet  and let's zoom in on it. Again  Hubble is there. Let's get into the butterfly's wings. Scholars have tried to explain  Why is it blue  Let's zoom in on it. What you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates the best architects in the world. All of this on a tiny scale. Besides its beauty and functioning  there is another side to it. In nature  all that is organized in extraordinary structures has a function. This function of the morpho butterfly   it is not blue  it does not have blue pigments. It has photonic crystals on its surface  according to people who studied it  which are extremely  sophisticated crystals. Our technology had nothing like that at the time. Hitachi has now made a monitor that uses this technology  and it is used in optical fibers to transmit    Janine Benyus  who's been here several times  talks about it  biomimetics. My time's up. Then  I'll wrap it up with what is at the base of this capacity  of this competence of biodiversity  producing all these wonderful services  the living cell. It is a structure with a few microns  which is an internal wonder. There are TED Talks about it. I won't talk much longer  but each person in this room  including myself  has     trillion of these micromachines in their body  so that we can enjoy well being. Imagine what is out there in the Amazon forest      trillion. This is greater than the number of stars in the sky. And we are not aware of it. Thank you so much.  Applause  We are at a remarkable moment in time. We face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next     years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. Let me illustrate with an example. I first visited Beijing    years ago to teach at the People's University of China. China was getting serious about market economics and about university education  so they decided to call in the foreign experts. Like most other people  I moved around Beijing by bicycle. Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle  it was a safe and easy way to get around. Cycling in Beijing now is a completely different prospect. The roads are jammed by cars and trucks. The air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel. When I was there last in the spring  there was an advisory for people of my age   over      to stay indoors and not move much. How did this come about  It came from the way in which Beijing has grown as a city. It's doubled over those    years  more than doubled  from    million to    million. It's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel  dirty energy  particularly coal. China burns half the world's coal each year  and that's why  it is a key reason why  it is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. At the same time  we have to recognize that in that period China has grown remarkably. It has become the world's second largest economy. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. That's really important. But at the same time  the people of China are asking the question  What's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable  They've analyzed  diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development. China's planning to scale back coal. It's looking to build its cities in different ways. Now  the growth of China is part of a dramatic change  fundamental change  in the structure of the world economy. Just    years ago  the developing countries  the poorer countries of the world  were  notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people  they accounted for only about a third of the world's output. Now it's more than half     years from now  it will probably be two thirds from the countries that we saw    years ago as developing. That's a remarkable change. It means that most countries around the world  rich or poor  are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that I want to talk about and highlight. Now  the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that I've already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing. Fifty percent now in urban areas. That's going to go to    percent in     . Over the next two decades  we'll see the demand for energy rise by    percent  and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land  on our water and on our forests. This is profound structural change. If we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way  we will create waste  pollution  congestion  destruction of land and forests. If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated with my numbers   cities  energy  land   if we manage all that badly  then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods of the people around the world would be poor and damaged. And more than that  the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise  with immense risks to our climate. Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than they've been for millions of years. If we go on increasing those concentrations  we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years. We've been around as Homo sapiens   that's a rather generous definition  sapiens   for perhaps a quarter of a million years  a quarter of a million. We risk temperatures we haven't seen for tens of millions of years over a century. That would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet. It would lead to changing deserts  changing rivers  changing patterns of hurricanes  changing sea levels  hundreds of millions of people  perhaps billions of people who would have to move  and if we've learned anything from history  that means severe and extended conflict. And we couldn't just turn it off. You can't make a peace treaty with the planet. You can't negotiate with the laws of physics. You're in there. You're stuck. Those are the stakes we're playing for  and that's why we have to make this second transformation  the climate transformation  and move to a low carbon economy. Now  the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway. We have to decide whether to do it well or badly  the economic  or structural  transformation. But the second of the transformations  the climate transformations  we have to decide to do. Those two transformations face us in the next two decades. The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do. Now  the more I've thought about this  the two transformations coming together  the more I've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity. It's an opportunity which we can use or it's an opportunity which we can lose. And let me explain through those three key areas that I've identified  cities  energy and land. And let me start with cities. I've already described the problems of Beijing  pollution  congestion  waste and so on. Surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world. Now  with cities  like life but particularly cities  you have to think ahead. The cities that are going to be built   and there are many  and many big ones   we have to think of how to design them in a compact way so we can save travel time  and we can save energy. The cities that already are  there  well established  we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities  and make it easier  encourage more people  to live closer to the center. We've got examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that. The bus rapid transport system in Bogot  in Colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non polluting way in a city  very frequent buses  strongly protected routes  the same service  really  as an underground railway system  but much  much cheaper and can be done much more quickly  a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that's developing. Now  some things in cities do take time. Some things in cities can happen much more quickly. Take my hometown  London. In       smog in London killed       people and badly damaged the lives of many  many more. And it happened all the time. For those of you live outside London in the U.K. will remember it used to be called The Smoke. That's the way London was. By regulating coal  within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly reduced. I remember the smogs well. When the visibility dropped to  less  than a few meters  they stopped the buses and I had to walk. This was the     s. I had to walk home three miles from school. Again  breathing was a hazardous activity. But it was changed. It was changed by a decision. Good decisions can bring good results  striking results  quickly. We've seen more  In London  we've introduced the congestion charge  actually quite quickly and effectively  and we've seen great improvements in the bus system  and cleaned up the bus system. You can see that the two transformations I've described  the structural and the climate  come very much together. But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities  and we have to invest wisely  and if we do  we'll see cleaner cities  quieter cities  safer cities  more attractive cities  more productive cities  and stronger community in those cities   public transport  recycling  reusing  all sorts of things that bring communities together. We can do that  but we have to think  we have to invest  we have to plan. Let me turn to energy. Now  energy over the last    years has increased by about    percent. Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels. Over the next    years  perhaps it will increase by another    percent or so. We have to invest strongly in energy  we have to use it much more efficiently  and we have to make it clean. We can see how to do that. Take the example of California. It would be in the top    countries in the world if it was independent. I don't want to start any   California's a big place. In the next five or six years  they will likely move from around    percent in renewables   wind  solar and so on   to over    percent  and that would bring California back to greenhouse gas emissions in      to where they were in       a period when the economy in California would more or less have doubled. That's a striking achievement. It shows what can be done. Not just California   the  incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of     million people who don't have electricity in India. They've set themselves a target of five years. I think they've got a good chance of doing that. We'll see  but what you're seeing now is people moving much more quickly. Four hundred million  more than the population of the United States. Those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of change. Again  you can see good decisions can bring quick results  and those two transformations  the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon  are intimately intertwined. Do the first one well  the structural  the second one on the climate becomes much easier. Look at land  land and particularly forests. Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species. They hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere  fundamental to the tackling of climate change. But we're losing our forests. In the last decade  we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal  and much more has been degraded. But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that. We can recognize the problem  but we can also understand how to tackle it. In Brazil  the rate of deforestation has been reduced by    percent over the last    years. How  By involving local communities  investing in their agriculture and their economies  by monitoring more carefully  by enforcing the law more strictly. And it's not just stopping deforestation. That's of course of first and fundamental importance  but it's also regrading degraded land  regenerating  rehabilitating degraded land. I first went to Ethiopia in     . It was desperately poor. In the following years  it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict. Over the last few years  actually more than a few  Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly. It has ambitions to be a middle income country    years from now and to be carbon neutral. Again  I think it's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one. You're seeing that commitment there. You're seeing what can be done. Ethiopia is investing in clean energy. It's working in the rehabilitation of land. In Humbo  in southwest Ethiopia  a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest management has led to big increases in living standards. So we can see  from Beijing to London  from California to India  from Brazil to Ethiopia  we do understand how to manage those two transformations  the structural and the climate. We do understand how to manage those well. And technology is changing very rapidly. I don't have to list all those things to an audience like this  but you can see the electric cars  you can see the batteries using new materials. You can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we're away. You can see better insulation. And there's much more coming. But  and it's a big but  the world as a whole is moving far too slowly. We're not cutting emissions in the way we should. We're not managing those structural transformations as we can. The depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change are not there yet. The depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet. We need political pressure to build. We need leaders to step up. We can have better growth  better climate  a better world. We can make  by managing those two transformations well  the next     years the best of centuries. If we make a mess of it  we  you and me  if we make a mess of it  if we don't manage those transformations properly  it will be  the next     years will be the worst of centuries. That's the major conclusion of the report on the economy and climate chaired by ex President Felipe Calder n of Mexico  and I co chaired that with him  and we handed that report yesterday here in New York  in the United Nations Building to the Secretary General of the U.N.  Ban Ki moon. We know that we can do this. Now  two weeks ago  I became a grandfather for the fourth time. Our daughter   Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa. Two weeks old. Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues  that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities  and still we failed to act  Surely not. Let's make the next     years the best of centuries. America's favorite pie is  Audience  Apple. Kenneth Cukier  Apple. Of course it is. How do we know it  Because of data. You look at supermarket sales. You look at supermarket sales of    centimeter pies that are frozen  and apple wins  no contest. The majority of the sales are apple. But then supermarkets started selling smaller     centimeter pies  and suddenly  apple fell to fourth or fifth place. Why  What happened  Okay  think about it. When you buy a    centimeter pie  the whole family has to agree  and apple is everyone's second favorite. But when you buy an individual    centimeter pie  you can buy the one that you want. You can get your first choice. You have more data. You can see something that you couldn't see when you only had smaller amounts of it. Now  the point here is that more data doesn't just let us see more  more of the same thing we were looking at. More data allows us to see new. It allows us to see better. It allows us to see different. In this case  it allows us to see what America's favorite pie is  not apple. Now  you probably all have heard the term big data. In fact  you're probably sick of hearing the term big data. It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term  and that is very unfortunate  because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance. In the past  we used to look at small data and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world  and now we have a lot more of it  more than we ever could before. What we find is that when we have a large body of data  we can fundamentally do things that we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts. Big data is important  and big data is new  and when you think about it  the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges   to feed people  supply them with medical care  supply them with energy  electricity  and to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp because of global warming   is because of the effective use of data. So what is new about big  data  What is the big deal  Well  to answer that question  let's think about what information looked like  physically looked like in the past. In       on the island of Crete  archaeologists discovered a clay disc. They dated it from      B.C.  so it's       years old. Now  there's inscriptions on this disc  but we actually don't know what it means. It's a complete mystery  but the point is that this is what information used to look like       years ago. This is how society stored and transmitted information. Now  society hasn't advanced all that much. We still store information on discs  but now we can store a lot more information  more than ever before. Searching it is easier. Copying it easier. Sharing it is easier. Processing it is easier. And what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data. In this respect  the data has gone from a stock to a flow  from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic. There is  if you will  a liquidity to information. The disc that was discovered off of Crete that's       years old  is heavy  it doesn't store a lot of information  and that information is unchangeable. By contrast  all of the files that Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail  and it can be shared at the speed of light. More data. More. Now  one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we've always collected information on  but another reason why is we're taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data format and we are putting it into data. Think  for example  the question of location. Take  for example  Martin Luther. If we wanted to know in the     s where Martin Luther was  we would have to follow him at all times  maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell  and record it  but now think about what it looks like today. You know that somewhere  probably in a telecommunications carrier's database  there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you've been at all times. If you have a cell phone  and that cell phone has GPS  but even if it doesn't have GPS  it can record your information. In this respect  location has been datafied. Now think  for example  of the issue of posture  the way that you are all sitting right now  the way that you sit  the way that you sit  the way that you sit. It's all different  and it's a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back  and if I were to put sensors   maybe     sensors into all of your chairs right now  I could create an index that's fairly unique to you  sort of like a fingerprint  but it's not your finger. So what could we do with this  Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti theft device in cars. The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel  tries to stream off  but the car recognizes that a non approved driver is behind the wheel  and maybe the engine just stops  unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say   Hey  I have authorization to drive.  Great. What if every single car in Europe had this technology in it  What could we do then  Maybe  if we aggregated the data  maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds. And then what we will have datafied is driver fatigue  and the service would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position  automatically knows  hey  set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel  honk inside to say   Hey  wake up  pay more attention to the road.  These are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives. So what is the value of big data  Well  think about it. You have more information. You can do things that you couldn't do before. One of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence  which itself is a branch of computer science. The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do  we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself. And it will help you understand it by seeing its origins. In the     s  a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers  so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won. He played. He won. He played. He won  because the computer only knew what a legal move was. Arthur Samuel knew something else. Arthur Samuel knew strategy. So he wrote a small sub program alongside it operating in the background  and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself. It collects more data. It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction. And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  and he plays it  and he loses  and Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self driving cars  Are we any better off as a society enshrining all the rules of the road into software  No. Memory is cheaper. No. Algorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No. All of those things matter  but that's not why. It's because we changed the nature of the problem. We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say   Here's a lot of data around the vehicle. You figure it out. You figure it out that that is a traffic light  that that traffic light is red and not green  that that means that you need to stop and not go forward.  Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online  search engines  Amazon's personalization algorithm  computer translation  voice recognition systems. Researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies  cancerous biopsies  and they've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not  and sure enough  when you throw the data at it  through a machine learning algorithm  the machine was able to identify the    telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous. The problem  The medical literature only knew nine of them. Three of the traits were ones that people didn't need to look for  but that the machine spotted. Now  there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives  but there are problems that we need to be conscious of  and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions  that the police may use big data for their purposes  a little bit like  Minority Report.  Now  it's a term called predictive policing  or algorithmic criminology  and the idea is that if we take a lot of data  for example where past crimes have been  we know where to send the patrols. That makes sense  but the problem  of course  is that it's not simply going to stop on location data  it's going to go down to the level of the individual. Why don't we use data about the person's high school transcript  Maybe we should use the fact that they're unemployed or not  their credit score  their web surfing behavior  whether they're up late at night. Their Fitbit  when it's able to identify biochemistries  will show that they have aggressive thoughts. We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do  and we may be held accountable before we've actually acted. Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era. In the big data age  the challenge will be safeguarding free will  moral choice  human volition  human agency. There is another problem  Big data is going to steal our jobs. Big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar  professional knowledge work in the   st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the   th century. Think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it's cancerous or not. The person went to university. The person buys property. He or she votes. He or she is a stakeholder in society. And that person's job  as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person  is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated. Now  we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short  temporary period of dislocation  and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live  the Industrial Revolution  because that's precisely what happened. But we forget something in that analysis  There are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back. The Industrial Revolution wasn't very good if you were a horse. So we're going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs  our very human needs. We have to be the master of this technology  not its servant. We are just at the outset of the big data era  and honestly  we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect. It's not just a problem for the National Security Agency. Businesses collect lots of data  and they misuse it too  and we need to get better at this  and this will take time. It's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire. This is a tool  but this is a tool that  unless we're careful  will burn us. Big data is going to transform how we live  how we work and how we think. It is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope and happiness and health  but in the past  we've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the T  the technology  the hardware  because that's what was physical. We now need to recast our gaze at the I  the information  which is less apparent  but in some ways a lot more important. Humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect  as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it  and that's why big data is a big deal. When I turned     I started my career as the first female photojournalist in the Gaza Strip  Palestine. My work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions  and created a lasting stigma for me and my family. The male dominated field made my presence unwelcome by all possible means. They made clear that a woman must not do a man's job. Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me because of my gender. The  No  sign was pretty clear. Three of my colleagues went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area where the explosion sounds were the only thing I could hear. Dust was flying in the air  and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me. I only realized we weren't there to document the event when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep and drove away  waving and laughing  leaving me behind in the open air strike zone. For a moment  I felt terrified  humiliated  and sorry for myself. My colleagues' action was not the only death threat I have received  but it was the most dangerous one. The perception of women's life in Gaza is passive. Until a recent time  a lot of  women were not allowed to work or pursue education. At times of such doubled war including both social restrictions on women and the Israeli Palestinian conflict  women's dark and bright stories were fading away. To men  women's stories were seen as inconsequential. I started paying closer attention to women's lives in Gaza. Because of my gender  I had access to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden. Beyond the obvious pain and struggle  there was a healthy dose of laughter and accomplishments. In front of a police compound in Gaza City during the first war in Gaza  an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound and break my nose. For a moment  all I saw was white  bright white  like these lights. I thought to myself I either got blind or I was in heaven. By the time I managed to open my eyes  I had documented this moment. Mohammed Khader  a Palestinian worker who spent two decades in Israel  as his retirement plan  he decided to build a four floor house  only by the first field operation at his neighborhood  the house was flattened to the ground. Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised and a jacuzzi  a bathtub that he got from Tel Aviv. Mohammed got the bathtub on the top of the rubble and started giving his kids an every morning bubble bath. My work is not meant to hide the scars of war  but to show the full frame of unseen stories of Gazans. As a Palestinian female photographer  the journey of struggle  survival and everyday life has inspired me to overcome the community taboo and see a different side of war and its aftermath. I became a witness with a choice  to run away or stand still. Thank you. I've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County  New York. I've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy. If you are like most people  death might be one of your greatest fears. Some of us will see it coming. Some of us won't. There is a little known documented medical term called impending doom. It's almost a symptom. As a medical provider  I'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other  so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says   I'm going to die today   we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition. Throughout my career  I have responded to a number of incidents where the patient had minutes left to live and there was nothing I could do for them. With this  I was faced with a dilemma  Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death  or do I lie to them to comfort them  Early in my career  I faced this dilemma by simply lying. I was afraid. I was afraid if I told them the truth  that they would die in terror  in fear  just grasping for those last moments of life. That all changed with one incident. Five years ago  I responded to a motorcycle accident. The rider had suffered critical  critical injuries. As I assessed him  I realized that there was nothing that could be done for him  and like so many other cases  he looked me in the eye and asked that question   Am I going to die   In that moment  I decided to do something different. I decided to tell him the truth. I decided to tell him that he was going to die and that there was nothing I could do for him. His reaction shocked me to this day. He simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face. He was not met with that terror or fear that I thought he would be. He simply laid there  and as I looked into his eyes  I saw inner peace and acceptance. From that moment forward  I decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies. Having responded to many cases since then where patients were in their last moments and there was nothing I could do for them  in almost every case  they have all had the same reaction to the truth  of inner peace and acceptance. In fact  there are three patterns I have observed in all these cases. The first pattern always kind of shocked me. Regardless of religious belief or cultural background  there's a need for forgiveness. Whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret  their guilt is universal. I had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack. As I prepared myself and my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest  I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise. He already knew by my tone of voice and body language. As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest  prepping for what was going to happen  he looked me in the eye and said   I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time.  Faced with imminent death  all he wanted was forgiveness. The second pattern I observe is the need for remembrance. Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones'  they needed to feel that they would be living on. There's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones  myself  my crew  or anyone around. Countless times  I have had a  patient look me in the eyes and say   Will you remember me   The final pattern I observe always touched me the deepest  to the soul. The dying need to know that their life had meaning. They need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks. This came to me very  very early in my career. I had responded to a call. There was a female in her late   s severely pinned within a vehicle. She had been t boned at a high rate of speed  critical  critical condition. As the fire department worked to remove her from the car  I climbed in to begin to render care. As we talked  she had said to me   There was so much more I wanted to do with my life.  She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth. As we talked further  it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school. Because of her  two children had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors. It would end up taking    minutes to free her from the vehicle. However  she perished prior to freeing her. I believed what you saw in the movies  when you're in those last moments that it's strictly terror  fear. I have come to realize  regardless of the circumstance  it's generally met with peace and acceptance  that it's the littlest things  the littlest moments  the littlest things you brought into the world that give you peace in those final moments. Thank you. When  in       still a student  I got a traveling fellowship to study housing in North America. We traveled the country. We saw public housing high rise buildings in all major cities  New York  Philadelphia. Those who have no choice lived there. And then we traveled from suburb to suburb  and I came back thinking  we've got to reinvent the apartment building. There has to be another way of doing this. We can't sustain suburbs  so let's design a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit. Habitat would be all about gardens  contact with nature  streets instead of corridors. We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy  and there it is almost    years later. It's a very desirable place to live in. It's now a heritage building  but it did not proliferate. In       I made my first trip to China. It was the Cultural Revolution. We traveled the country  met with architects and planners. This is Beijing then  not a single high rise building in Beijing or Shanghai. Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city. There were hardly any cars. Thirty years later  this is Beijing today. This is Hong Kong. If you're wealthy  you live there  if you're poor  you live there  but high density it is  and it's not just Asia. S o Paulo  you can travel in a helicopter    minutes seeing those high rise buildings consume the   th century low rise environment. And with it  comes congestion  and we lose mobility  and so on and so forth. So a few years ago  we decided to go back and rethink Habitat. Could we make it more affordable  Could we actually achieve this quality of life in the densities that are prevailing today  And we realized  it's basically about light  it's about sun  it's about nature  it's about fractalization. Can we open up the surface of the building so that it has more contact with the exterior  We came up with a number of models  economy models  cheaper to build and more compact  membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens. And then we decided to take New York as a test case  and we looked at Lower Manhattan. And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan. On the left is Manhattan today  blue for housing  red for office buildings  retail. On the right  we reconfigured it  the office buildings form the base  and then rising    stories above  are apartments. There's a street in the air on the   th level  a community street. It's permeable. There are gardens and open spaces for the community  almost every unit with its own private garden  and community space all around. And most important  permeable  open. It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city  and light permeates everywhere. And in the last two or three years  we've actually been  for the first time  realizing the quality of life of Habitat in real life projects across Asia. This in Qinhuangdao in China  middle income housing  where there is a bylaw that every apartment must receive three hours of sunlight. That's measured in the winter solstice. And under construction in Singapore  again middle income housing  gardens  community streets and parks and so on and so forth. And Colombo. And I want to touch on one more issue  which is the design of the public realm. A hundred years after we've begun building with tall buildings  we are yet to understand how the tall high rise building becomes a building block in making a city  in creating the public realm. In Singapore  we had an opportunity     million square feet  extremely high density. Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor  promenades and parks integrated with intense urban life. So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces  and you move from one to the other  and there is contact with nature  and most relevantly  at every level of the structure  public gardens and open space  on the roof of the podium  climbing up the towers  and finally on the roof  the sky park  two and a half acres  jogging paths  restaurants  and the world's longest swimming pool. And that's all I can tell you in five minutes. Thank you. I am an engineering professor  and for the past    years I've been teaching crap. Not that I'm a bad teacher  but I've been studying and teaching about human waste and how waste is conveyed through these wastewater treatment plants  and how we engineer and design these treatment plants so that we can protect surface water like rivers. I've based my scientific career on using leading edge molecular techniques  DNA  and RNA based methods to look at microbial populations in biological reactors  and again to optimize these systems. And over the years  I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets  and I've been known to sneak into toilets and take my camera phone all over the world. But along the way  I've learned that it's not just the technical side  but there's also this thing called the culture of crap. So for example  how many of you are washers and how many of you are wipers  If  well  I guess you know what I mean. If you're a washer  then you use water for anal cleansing. That's the technical term. And if you're a wiper  then you use toilet paper or  in some regions of the world where it's not available  newspaper or rags or corncobs. And this is not just a piece of trivia  but it's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem. And it is a big problem  There are  .  billion people in the world who don't have access to adequate sanitation. For them  there's no modern toilet. And there are  .  billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open spaces  and again  the technical term for that is open defecation  but that is really simply shitting in the open. And if you're living in fecal material and it's surrounding you  you're going to get sick. It's going to get into your drinking water  into your food  into your immediate surroundings. So the United Nations estimates that every year  there are   .  million child deaths because of inadequate sanitation. That's one preventable death every    seconds      every hour        every day. And so  to avoid open defecation  municipalities and cities build infrastructure  for example  like pit latrines  in peri urban and rural areas. For example  in KwaZulu Natal  province in South Africa  they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines. But there's a problem when you scale up to tens of thousands  and the problem is  what happens when the pits are full  This is what happens. People defecate around the toilet. In schools  children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail outside the building and start defecating around the building  and these pits have to be cleaned and manually emptied. And who does the emptying  You've got these workers who have to sometimes go down into the pits and manually remove the contents. It's a dirty and dangerous business. As you can see  there's no protective equipment  no protective clothing. There's one worker down there. I hope you can see him. He's got a face mask on  but no shirt. And in some countries  like India  the lower castes are condemned to empty the pits  and they're further condemned by society. So you ask yourself  how can we solve this and why don't we just build Western style flush toilets for these two and a half billion  And the answer is  it's just not possible. In some of these areas  there's not enough water  there's no energy  it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems  and if you don't build it right  you're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river  just like what's happening in many cities in the developing world. And is this really the solution  Because essentially  what you're doing is you're using clean water and you're using it to flush your toilet  convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then discharges to a river  and that river  again  is a drinking water source. So we've got to rethink sanitation  and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure  and I'm going to argue that to do this  you have to employ systems thinking. We have to look at the whole sanitation chain. We start with a human interface  and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored  transported  treated and reused   and not just disposal but reuse. So let's start with the human user interface. I say  it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper  a sitter or a squatter  the human user interface should be clean and easy to use  because after all  taking a dump should be pleasurable. And when we open the possibilities to understanding this sanitation chain  then the back end technology  the collection to the reuse  should not really matter  and then we can apply locally adoptable and context sensitive solutions. So we can open ourselves to possibilities like  for example  this urine diverting toilet  and there's two holes in this toilet. There's the front and the back  and the front collects the urine  and the back collects the fecal material. And so what you're doing is you're separating the urine  which has    percent of the nitrogen and    percent of the phosphorus  and then that can then be treated and precipitated to form things like struvite  which is a high value fertilizer  and then the fecal material can then be disinfected and again converted to high value end products. Or  for example  in some of our research  you can reuse the water by treating it in on site sanitation systems like planter boxes or constructed wetlands. So we can open up all these possibilities if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets and treatment plants. So you might be asking  who's going to pay  Well  I'm going to argue that governments should fund sanitation infrastructure. NGOs and donor organizations  they can do their best  but it's not going to be enough. Governments should fund sanitation the same way they fund roads and schools and hospitals and other infrastructure like bridges  because we know  and the WHO has done this study  that for every dollar that we invest in sanitation infrastructure  we get something like three to    dollars back. Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying. So at North Carolina State University  we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution  and this is what they came up with  a simple  modified screw auger that can move the waste up from the pit and into a collecting drum  and now the pit worker doesn't have to go down into the pit. We tested it in South Africa  and it works. We need to make it more robust  and we're going to do more testing in Malawi and South Africa this coming year. And our idea is to make this a professionalized pit emptying service so that we can create a small business out of it  create profits and jobs  and the hope is that  as we are rethinking sanitation  we are extending the life of these pits so that we don't have to resort to quick solutions that don't really make sense. I believe that access to adequate sanitation is a basic human right. We need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower status people going down and being condemned to empty pits. It is our moral  it is our social and our environmental obligation. Thank you. Women represent    percent of middle management and professional positions  but the percentages of women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of that number. So some people hear that statistic and they ask  why do we have so few women leaders  But I look at that statistic and  if you  like me  believe that leadership manifests at every level  you would see that there's a tremendous  awesome resource of leaders who are leading in middle management  which raises a different question  Why are there so many women mired in the middle and what has to happen to take them to the top  So some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization. Well  Tonya is a great example of one of these women. I met her two years ago. She was a vice president in a Fortune    company  and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration   I've worked really hard to improve my confidence and my assertiveness and develop a great brand  I get terrific performance evals from my boss  my    s in the organization let me know that my teams love working for me  I've taken every management course that I can here  I am working with a terrific mentor  and yet I've been passed over twice for advancement opportunities  even when my manager knows that I'm committed to moving up and even interested in an international assignment. I don't understand why I'm being passed over.  So what Tonya doesn't realize is that there's a missing    percent of the career success equation for women  and it's understanding what this missing    percent is that's required to close the gender gap at the top. In order to move up in organizations  you have to be known for your leadership skills  and this would apply to any of you  women or men. It means that you have to be recognized for using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others. Put in other language  it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others inside of the organization and outside. And although all three of these elements of leadership are important  when it comes to moving up in organizations  they aren't equally important. So pay attention to the green box as I move forward. In seeking and identifying employees with high potential  the potential to go to the top of organizations  the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership. These skills and competencies can be summarized as business  strategic  and financial acumen. In other words  this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going  what its strategy is  what financial targets it has in place  and understanding your role in moving the organization forward. This is that missing    percent of the career success equation for women  not because it's missing in our capabilities or abilities  but because it's missing in the advice that we're given. Here's what I mean by that. Five years ago  I was asked to moderate a panel of executives  and the topic for the evening was  What do you look for in  high potential employees   So think about the three elements of leadership as I summarize for you what they told me. They said   We look for people who are smart and hard working and committed and trustworthy and resilient.  So which element of leadership does that relate to  Personal greatness. They said   We look for employees who are great with our customers  who empower their teams  who negotiate effectively  who are able to manage conflict well  and are overall great communicators.  Which element of leadership does that equate to  Engaging the greatness in others. And then they pretty much stopped. So I asked   Well  what about people who understand your business  where it's going  and their role in taking it there  And what about people who are able to scan the external environment  identify risks and opportunities  make strategy or make strategic recommendations  And what about people who are able to look at the financials of your business  understand the story that the financials tell  and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations   And to a man  they said   That's a given.  So I turned to the audience of     women and I asked   How many of you have ever been told that the door opener for career advancement is your business  strategic and financial acumen  and that all the other important stuff is what differentiates you in the talent pool   Three women raised their hand  and I've asked this question of women all around the globe in the five years since  and the percentage is never much different. So this is obvious  right  But how can it be  Well  there are primarily three reasons that there's this missing    percent in the career success advice given to women  When organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional advice that we've been hearing for over    years  there's a notable absence of advice that relates to business  strategic and financial acumen. Much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take  like become more assertive  become more confident  develop your personal brand  things that Tonya's been working on  and advice about working with other people  things like learn to self promote  get a mentor  enhance your network  and virtually nothing said about the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen. This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant. What it means is that this is advice that's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start to middle management  but it's not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle  where we're    percent  to senior and executive positions. And this is why conventional advice to women in    years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top and won't close it. Now  the second reason relates to Tonya's comments about having had excellent performance evals  great feedback from her teams  and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on. So you would think that she's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business  strategic and financial acumen  but here again  that green square is quite small. On average  talent and performance management systems in the organizations that I've worked with focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen  which is why typical talent and performance systems haven't closed and won't close the gender gap at the top. Now  Tonya also talked about working with a mentor  and this is really important to talk about  because if organizations  talent and performance systems aren't giving people in general information about the importance of business  strategic and financial acumen  how are men getting to the top  Well  there are primarily two ways. One is because of the positions they're guided into  and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship. So what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring  Well  this comment from an executive that I worked with recently illustrates that experience. He was very proud of the fact that last year  he had two prot g s  a man and a woman. And he said   I helped the woman build confidence  I helped the man learn the business  and I didn't realize that I was treating them any differently.  And he was sincere about that. So what this illustrates is that as managers  whether we're women or men  we have mindsets about women and men  about careers in leadership  and these unexamined mindsets won't close the gender gap at the top. So how do we take this idea of the missing    percent and turn it into action  Well  for women  the answer is obvious  we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we're people who understand our businesses  where they're headed  and our role in taking it there. That's what enables that breakthrough from middle management to leadership at the top. But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this. One young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her insight about the missing    percent to weave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room. So we don't want to put     percent of the responsibility on women's shoulders  nor would it be wise to do so  and here's why  In order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals  executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction. In other words  the term we use in business is  we have to have strategic alignment. And executives know this very well  and yet only    percent  according to a recent Conference Board report  believe that they have that strategic alignment in place. So for    percent of organizations  achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable. And if you think about what I've just shared  that you have situations where at least    percent of your middle managers haven't received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business  where it's headed  and their role in taking it there  it's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low  which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this. It's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions. Why  Because if they aren't seeing that  it could be a red flag that their organization isn't as aligned as it could potentially be. It's important for CEOs to also expect these proportional pools  and if they hear comments like   Well  she doesn't have enough business experience   ask the question   What are we going to do about that   It's important for H.R. executives to make sure that the missing    percent is appropriately emphasized  and it's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine the mindsets we hold about women and men  about careers and success  to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody. So let me close with the latest chapter in Tonya's story. Tonya emailed me two months ago  and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position  and during the interview  they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry  and she said that she was so happy to report that now she has a new position reporting directly to the  chief information officer at her company. So for some of you  the missing    percent is an idea for you to put into action  and I hope that for all of you  you will see it as an idea worth spreading in order to help organizations be more effective  to help women create careers that soar  and to help close the gender gap at the top. Thank you. I want to tell you how        remarkable young people from over     countries ended up in Cuba and are transforming health in their communities. Ninety percent of them would never have left home at all if it weren't for a scholarship to study medicine in Cuba and a commitment to go back to places like the ones they'd come from   remote farmlands  mountains  ghettos   to become doctors for people like themselves  to walk the walk. Havana's Latin American Medical School  It's the largest medical school in the world  graduating        young doctors since its first class of       with nearly        more in the pipeline. Its mission  to train physicians for the people who need them the most  the over one billion who have never seen a doctor  the people who live and die under every poverty line ever invented. Its students defy all norms. They're the school's biggest risk and also its best bet. They're recruited from the poorest  most broken places on our planet by a school that believes they can become not just the good but the excellent physicians their communities desperately need  that they will practice where most doctors don't  in places not only poor but oftentimes dangerous  carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks or navigating neighborhoods riddled by drugs  gangs and bullets  their home ground. The hope is that they will help transform access to care  the health picture in impoverished areas  and even the way medicine itself is learned and practiced  and that they will become pioneers in our global reach for universal health coverage  surely a tall order. Two big storms and this notion of  walk the walk  prompted creation of ELAM back in     . The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch had ripped through the Caribbean and Central America  leaving        dead and two and a half million homeless. Hundreds of Cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response  but when they got there  they found a bigger disaster  whole communities with no healthcare  doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff  and just too many babies dying before their first birthday. What would happen when these Cuban doctors left  New doctors were needed to make care sustainable  but where would they come from  Where would they train  In Havana  the campus of a former naval academy was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry to become the Latin American Medical School  ELAM. Tuition  room and board  and a small stipend were offered to hundreds of students from the countries hardest hit by the storms. As a journalist in Havana  I watched the first    Nicaraguans arrive in March       settling into dorms barely refurbished and helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms but move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes. Over the next few years  governments throughout the Americas requested scholarships for their own students  and the Congressional Black Caucus asked for and received hundreds of scholarships for young people from the USA. Today  among the        are graduates from    countries in the Americas  Africa and Asia  and enrollment has grown to     nations. More than half the students are young women. They come from     ethnic groups  speak    different languages. WHO Director Margaret Chan said   For once  if you are poor  female  or from an indigenous population  you have a distinct advantage  an ethic that makes this medical school unique.  Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho on the Atlantic coast of Honduras. There's no running water  no electricity there  and to reach the village  you have to walk for hours or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did skirting the waves of the Atlantic. Luther was one of    Tocamacho children who started grammar school  the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people known as the Gar funa     percent of the Honduran population. The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away. Luther had to walk three hours every day to middle school. Only    made that trip. Only five went on to high school  and only one to university  Luther  to ELAM  among the first crop of Gar funa graduates. Just two Gar funa doctors had preceded them in all of Honduran history. Now there are     thanks to ELAM. Big problems need big solutions  sparked by big ideas  imagination and audacity  but also solutions that work. ELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them  so they learned the hard way  by doing and correcting course as they went. Even the brightest students from these poor communities weren't academically prepared for six years of medical training  so a bridging course was set up in sciences. Then came language  these were Mapuche  Quechuas  Guaran   Gar funa  indigenous peoples who learned Spanish as a second language  or Haitians who spoke Creole. So Spanish became part of the pre pre med curriculum. Even so  in Cuba  the music  the food  the smells  just about everything was different  so faculty became family  ELAM home. Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs to Yoruba  Muslim and Christian evangelical. Embracing diversity became a way of life. Why have so many countries asked for these scholarships  First  they just don't have enough doctors  and where they do  their distribution is skewed against the poor  because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources. We are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs  and the problem is everywhere. Doctors are concentrated in the cities  where only half the world's people live  and within cities  not in the shantytowns or South L.A. Here in the United States  where we have healthcare reform  we don't have the professionals we need. By       we will be short        primary care physicians. And we're also part of the problem. The United States is the number one importer of doctors from developing countries. The second reasons students flock to Cuba is the island's own health report card  relying on strong primary care. A commission from The Lancet rates Cuba among the best performing middle income countries in health. Save the Children ranks Cuba the best country in Latin America to become a mother. Cuba has similar life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the United States  with fewer disparities  while spending per person one   th of what we do on health here in the USA. Academically  ELAM is tough  but    percent of its students graduate. The subjects are familiar   basic and clinical sciences   but there are major differences. First  training has moved out of the ivory tower and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods  the kinds of places most of these grads will practice. Sure  they have lectures and hospital rotations too  but community based learning starts on day one. Second  students treat the whole patient  mind and body  in the context of their  families  their communities and their culture. Third  they learn public health  to assess their patients' drinking water  housing  social and economic conditions. Fourth  they are taught that a good patient interview and a thorough clinical exam provide most of the clues for diagnosis  saving costly technology for confirmation. And finally  they're taught over and over again the importance of prevention  especially as chronic diseases cripple health systems worldwide. Such an in service learning also comes with a team approach  as much how to work in teams as how to lead them  with a dose of humility. Upon graduation  these doctors share their knowledge with nurse's aids  midwives  community health workers  to help them become better at what they do  not to replace them  to work with shamans and traditional healers. ELAM's graduates  Are they proving this audacious experiment right  Dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they're capable of doing. Take the Gar funa grads. They not only went to work back home  but they organized their communities to build Honduras' first indigenous hospital. With an architect's help  residents literally raised it from the ground up. The first patients walked through the doors in December       and since then  the hospital has received nearly one million patient visits. And government is paying attention  upholding the hospital as a model of rural public health for Honduras. ELAM's graduates are smart  strong and also dedicated. Haiti  January     . The pain. People buried under    million tons of rubble. Overwhelming. Three hundred forty Cuban doctors were already on the ground long term. More were on their way. Many more were needed. At ELAM  students worked round the clock to contact       graduates. As a result  hundreds arrived in Haiti     countries' worth  from Mali in the Sahara to St. Lucia  Bolivia  Chile and the USA. They spoke easily to each other in Spanish and listened to their patients in Creole thanks to Haitian medical students flown in from ELAM in Cuba. Many stayed for months  even through the cholera epidemic. Hundreds of Haitian graduates had to pick up the pieces  overcome their own heartbreak  and then pick up the burden of building a new public health system for Haiti. Today  with aid of organizations and governments from Norway to Cuba to Brazil  dozens of new health centers have been built  staffed  and in    cases  headed by ELAM graduates. Yet the Haitian story also illustrates some of the bigger problems faced in many countries. Take a look      Haitian graduates by        when cholera struck  nearly half working in the public health sector but one quarter unemployed  and     had left Haiti altogether. So in the best case scenarios  these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems  where often they're the only doctors around. In the worst cases  there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector  where most poor people are treated  not enough political will  not enough resources  not enough anything   just too many patients with no care. The grads face pressure from their families too  desperate to make ends meet  so when there are no public sector jobs  these new MDs decamp into private practice  or go abroad to send money home. Worst of all  in some countries  medical societies influence accreditation bodies not to honor the ELAM degree  fearful these grads will take their jobs or reduce their patient loads and income. It's not a question of competencies. Here in the USA  the California Medical Board accredited the school after rigorous inspection  and the new physicians are making good on Cuba's big bet  passing their boards and accepted into highly respected residencies from New York to Chicago to New Mexico. Two hundred strong  they're coming back to the United States energized  and also dissatisfied. As one grad put it  in Cuba   We are trained to provide quality care with minimal resources  so when I see all the resources we have here  and you tell me that's not possible  I know it's not true. Not only have I seen it work  I've done the work.  ELAM's graduates  some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore  have come from the poorest of the poor to offer health  education and a voice to their communities. They've done the heavy lifting. Now we need to do our part to support the        and counting  All of us   foundations  residency directors  press  entrepreneurs  policymakers  people   need to step up. We need to do much more globally to give these new doctors the opportunity to prove their mettle. They need to be able to take their countries' licensing exams. They need jobs in the public health sector or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work. They need the chance to be the doctors their patients need. To move forward  we may have to find our way back to that pediatrician who would knock on my family's door on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid  who made house calls  who was a public servant. These aren't such new ideas of what medicine should be. What's new is the scaling up and the faces of the doctors themselves  an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she than a he  In the Amazon  Peru or Guatemala  an indigenous doctor  in the USA  a doctor of color who speaks fluent Spanish. She is well trained  can be counted on  and shares the face and culture of her patients  and she deserves our support surely  because whether by subway  mule  or canoe  she is teaching us to walk the walk. Thank you.  Applause  Today I want to tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world to paint a neural portrait of the human mind. And the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single  general purpose processor  but a collection of highly specialized components  each solving a different specific problem  and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers. To give you a feel for this idea  imagine the following scenario  You walk into your child's day care center. As usual  there's a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up  but this time  the children's faces look weirdly similar  and you can't figure out which child is yours. Do you need new glasses  Are you losing your mind  You run through a quick mental checklist. No  you seem to be thinking clearly  and your vision is perfectly sharp. And everything looks normal except the children's faces. You can see the faces  but they don't look distinctive  and none of them looks familiar  and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter. This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people. It's called prosopagnosia  and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain. The striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired  everything else is just fine. Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific mental deficits that can happen after brain damage. These syndromes collectively have suggested for a long time that the mind is divvied up into distinct components  but the effort to discover those components has jumped to warp speed with the invention of brain imaging technology  especially MRI. So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy at high resolution  so I'm going to show you in a second a set of MRI cross sectional images through a familiar object  and we're going to fly through them and you're going to try to figure out what the object is. Here we go. It's not that easy. It's an artichoke. Okay  let's try another one  starting from the bottom and going through the top. Broccoli  It's a head of broccoli. Isn't it beautiful  I love that. Okay  here's another one. It's a brain  of course. In fact  it's my brain. We're going through slices through my head like that. That's my nose over on the right  and now we're going over here  right there. So this picture's nice  if I do say so myself  but it shows only anatomy. The really cool advance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but activity  that is  where neurons are firing. So here's how this works. Brains are like muscles. When they get active  they need increased blood flow to supply that activity  and lucky for us  blood flow control to the brain is local  so if a bunch of neurons  say  right there get active and start firing  then blood flow increases just right there. So functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase  producing a higher MRI response where neural activity goes up. So to give you a concrete feel for how a functional MRI experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can't  let me describe one of the first studies I ever did. We wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces  and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that I described a moment ago  but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person  so we set out to look for it. So I was the first subject. I went into the scanner  I lay on my back  I held my head as still as I could while staring at pictures of faces like these and objects like these and faces and objects for hours. So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner  I can tell you that one of the skills that's really important for MRI research is bladder control. When I got out of the scanner  I did a quick analysis of the data  looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects  and here's what I saw. Now this image looks just awful by today's standards  but at the time I thought it was beautiful. What it shows is that region right there  that little blob  it's about the size of an olive and it's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there. And what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher MRI response  that is  higher neural activity  when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects. So that's pretty cool  but how do we know this isn't a fluke  Well  the easiest way is to just do the experiment again. So I got back in the scanner  I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects and I got a similar blob  and then I did it again and I did it again and again and again  and around about then I decided to believe it was for real. But still  maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there  so to find out  we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain. So the next question was  what does this thing really do  Is it really specialized just for face recognition  Well  maybe not  right  Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part. Maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round. The only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition is to rule out all of those hypotheses. So we spent much of the next couple of years scanning subjects while they looked at lots of different kinds of images  and we showed that that part of the brain responds strongly when you look at any images that are faces of any kind  and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn't a face  like some of these. So have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face recognition  No  we haven't. Brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything. All you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts. To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function  you need to mess with it and see what happens  and normally we don't get to do that. But an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here in his hospital bed where he's just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures. So it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area. So with the patient's consent  the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain. Now  the patient doesn't know where those electrodes are  and he's never heard of the face area. So let's watch what happens. It's going to start with a control condition that will say  Sham  nearly invisibly in red in the lower left  when no current is delivered  and you'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first. So let's watch. and tell me what happens when I do this. All right  Patient  Okay. Neurologist  One  two  three. Patient  Nothing. Neurologist  Nothing  Okay. I'm going to do it one more time. Look at my face. One  two  three. Patient  You just turned into somebody else. Your face metamorphosed. Your nose got saggy  it went to the left. You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before  but somebody different. That was a trip. Nancy Kanwisher  So this experiment   this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception. So I went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process. Next  I'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found. So to do this  I've spent a lot of time in the scanner over the last month so I can show you these things in my brain. So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere. So we're oriented like that. You're looking at my head this way. Imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that. Okay  now as you can see  the surface of the brain is all folded up. So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there. We want to see the whole thing  so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing. Next  let's find that face area I've been talking about that responds to images like these. To see that  let's turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom  and there it is  that's my face area. Just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information  and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places  like right now  I'm seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active. There's another one out on the outside surface again where there's a couple more face regions as well. Also in this vicinity is a region that's selectively involved in processing visual motion  like these moving dots here  and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain  and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these  and that region is shown in lime green at the bottom of the brain. Now all these regions I've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception. Do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses  like hearing  Yes  we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit  here's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago  and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch  like these. In contrast  that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don't have a clear pitch  like these. Okay. Next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech. Okay  now let's look at these same regions. In my left hemisphere  there's a similar arrangement   not identical  but similar   and most of the same regions are in here  albeit sometimes different in size. Now  everything I've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception  vision and hearing. Do we also have specialized brain regions for really fancy  complicated mental processes  Yes  we do. So here in pink are my language regions. So it's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language  but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively. They respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence  but not when you do other complex mental things  like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music. The most amazing region that's been found yet is this one right here in turquoise. This region responds when you think about what another person is thinking. So that may seem crazy  but actually  we humans do this all the time. You're doing this when you realize that your partner is going to be worried if you don't call home to say you're running late. I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now when I realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray  uncharted territory in the brain  and what's up with that  Well  I'm wondering about that too  and we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions. But importantly  I don't think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function  even mental functions that may be critical for survival. In fact  a few years ago  there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he'd found a brain region for detecting food  and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this. And further  he found a similar response in more or less the same location in    out of    subjects. So he was pretty stoked  and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on  Oprah  with his big discovery. But then he devised the critical test  He showed subjects images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape  but that weren't food  like these. And his region responded the same to both sets of images. So it wasn't a food area  it was just a region that liked colors and shapes. So much for  Oprah.  But then the question  of course  is  how do we process all this other stuff that we don't have specialized brain regions for  Well  I think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that I've been describing  we also have a lot of very general  purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along. In fact  we've shown recently that these regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all   well  of the seven that we've tested. So each of the brain regions that I've described to you today is present in approximately the same location in every normal subject. I could take any of you  pop you in the scanner  and find each of those regions in your brain  and it would look a lot like my brain  although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size. What's important to me about this work is not the particular locations of these brain regions  but the simple fact that we have selective  specific components of mind and brain in the first place. I mean  it could have been otherwise. The brain could have been a single  general purpose processor  more like a kitchen knife than a Swiss Army knife. Instead  what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind. So we have this picture of very general purpose machinery in our heads in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components. It's early days in this enterprise. We've painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind. The most fundamental questions remain unanswered. So for example  what does each of these regions do exactly  Why do we need three face areas and three place areas  and what's the division of labor between them  Second  how are all these things connected in the brain  With diffusion imaging  you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain  and with this method shown here  you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain  potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain. Third  how does all of this very systematic structure get built  both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species  To address questions like that  scientists are now scanning other species of animals  and they're also scanning human infants. Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism. That's a hugely important goal  and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it  but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that's worth doing. The effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease. What could be more thrilling than to understand the fundamental mechanisms that underlie human experience  to understand  in essence  who we are  This is  I think  the greatest scientific quest of all time. Recently  I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel. I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam  again playing music by this same composer. Let's take a look. I actually live there  around the corner. and you'd be really welcome. Man   In Dutch  Does that sound like fun  Child   In Dutch  Yes    In Dutch   Handel house concert   Daria van den Bercken  All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons. Now you may ask  why have I done these things  They're not really typical for a musician's day to day life. Well  I did it because I fell in love with the music and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible. It started a couple of years ago. I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little  when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard. Well  I was surprised. I did not know this. So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing. And what happened next was that I entered this state of pure  unprejudiced amazement. It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music  and I had not felt that in a long time. It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it. The first piece that I played through started like this. Well this sounds very melancholic  doesn't it  And I turned the page and what came next was this. Well  this sounds very energetic  doesn't it  So within a couple of minutes  and the piece isn't even finished yet  I experienced two very contrasting characters  beautiful melancholy and sheer energy. And I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions. And the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively. I've given a lot of children's concerts for children of seven and eight years old  and whatever I play  whether it's Bach  Beethoven  even Stockhausen  or some jazzy music  they are open to hear it  really willing to listen  and they are comfortable doing so. And when classes come in with children who are just a few years older          I felt that I sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that. The complexity of the music does become an issue  and actually the opinions of others   parents  friends  media   they start to count. But the young ones  they don't question their own opinion. They are in this constant state of wonder  and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven year old children  even when growing up. And that is why I have played not only in the concert hall but also on the street  online  in the air  to feel that state of wonder  to truly listen  and to listen without prejudice. And I would like to invite you to do so now. Thank you. It's very nice to be here tonight. So I've been working on the history of income and wealth distribution for the past    years  and one of the interesting lessons coming from this historical evidence is indeed that  in the long run  there is a tendency for  the rate of return of capital to exceed the economy's growth rate  and this tends to lead to  high concentration of wealth. Not infinite concentration of wealth  but the higher the gap between r and g  the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to converge. So this is a key force that I'm going to talk about today  but let me say right away that this is not the only important force in the dynamics of income  and wealth distribution  and there are many other forces that play an important role in the long run dynamics of income and wealth distribution. Also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected. We know a little bit more today than we used to know   but we still know too little  and certainly there are  many different processes   economic  social  political   that need to be studied more. And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force  but that doesn't mean that other important forces do not exist. So most of the data I'm going to present comes from this database that's available online  the World Top Incomes Database. So this is the largest existing historical database on inequality  and this comes from the effort of over    scholars from several dozen countries. So let me show you a couple of facts coming from this database  and then we'll return to r bigger than g. So fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between the United States and Europe over the past century. So back in             income inequality was actually much higher in Europe than in the United States  whereas today  it is a lot higher in the United States. So let me be very clear  The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g. It has more to do with changing supply and demand for skill  the race between education and technology  globalization  probably more unequal access to skills in the U.S.  where you have very good  very top universities but where the bottom part of the educational system is not as good  so very unequal access to skills  and also an unprecedented rise of top managerial compensation of the United States  which is difficult to account for just on the basis of education. So there is more going on here  but I'm not going to talk too much about this today  because I want to focus on wealth inequality. So let me just show you a very simple indicator about the income inequality part. So this is the share of total income going to the top    percent. So you can see that one century ago  it was between    and    percent in Europe and a little bit above    percent in the U.S.  so there was more inequality in Europe. Then there was a sharp decline during the first half of the   th century  and in the recent decade  you can see that the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe  and this is the first fact I just talked about. Now  the second fact is more about wealth inequality  and here the central fact is that wealth inequality is always a lot higher than income inequality  and also that wealth inequality  although it has also increased in recent decades  is still less extreme today than what it was a century ago  although the total quantity of wealth relative to income has now recovered from the very large shocks caused by World War I  the Great Depression  World War II. So let me show you two graphs illustrating fact number two and fact number three. So first  if you look at the level of wealth inequality  this is the share of total wealth going to the top    percent of wealth holders  so you can see the same kind of reversal between the U.S. and Europe that we had before for income inequality. So wealth concentration was higher in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago  and now it is the opposite. But you can also show two things  First  the general level of wealth inequality is always higher than income inequality. So remember  for income inequality  the share going to the top    percent was between    and    percent of total income  whereas for wealth  the share is always between    and    percent. Okay  so that's fact number one  and that's very important for what follows. Wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration. Fact number two is that the rise in wealth inequality in recent decades is still not enough to get us back to     . So the big difference today  wealth inequality is still very large  with        percent of total wealth for the top     but the good news is that it's actually better than one century ago  where you had    percent in Europe going to the top   . So today what you have is what I call the middle    percent  the people who are not in the top    and who are not in the bottom     and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns    to    percent of total wealth  national wealth  whereas they used to be poor  a century ago  when there was basically no wealth middle class. So this is an important change  and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality has not fully recovered to pre World War I levels  although the total quantity of wealth has recovered. Okay  So this is the total value of wealth relative to income  and you can see that in particular in Europe  we are almost back to the pre World War I level. So there are really two different parts of the story here. One has to do with the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate  and there is nothing bad per se  of course  in accumulating a lot of wealth  and in particular if it is more diffuse and less concentrated. So what we really want to focus on is the long run evolution of wealth inequality  and what's going to happen in the future. How can we account for the fact that until World War I  wealth inequality was so high and  if anything  was rising to even higher levels  and how can we think about the future  So let me come to some of the explanations and speculations about the future. Let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much more concentrated than income is a dynamic  dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons. If people were accumulating wealth only for life cycle reasons  you know  to be able to consume when they are old  then the level of wealth inequality should be more or less in line with the level of income inequality. But it will be very difficult to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model  so you need a story where people also care about wealth accumulation for other reasons. So typically  they want to transmit wealth to the next generation  to their children  or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth because of the prestige  the power that goes with wealth. So there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data. Now  in a large class of dynamic models of wealth accumulation with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth  you will have all sorts of random  multiplicative shocks. So for instance  some families have a very large number of children  so the wealth will be divided. Some families have fewer children. You also have shocks to rates of return. Some families make huge capital gains. Some made bad investments. So you will always have some mobility in the wealth process. Some people will move up  some people will move down. The important point is that  in any such model  for a given variance of such shocks  the equilibrium level of wealth inequality will be a steeply rising function of r minus g. And intuitively  the reason why the difference between the rate of return to wealth and the growth rate is important is that initial wealth inequalities will be amplified at a faster pace with a bigger r minus g. So take a simple example  with r equals five percent and g equals one percent  wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size of the economy. So this makes it easier to build and perpetuate large fortunes because you can consume four fifths  assuming zero tax  and you can just reinvest one fifth. So of course some families will consume more than that  some will consume less  so there will be some mobility in the distribution  but on average  they only need to reinvest one fifth  so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained. Now  you should not be surprised by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever  because  in fact  this is what happened during most of the history of mankind. And this was in a way very obvious to everybody for a simple reason  which is that growth was close to zero percent during most of the history of mankind. Growth was maybe  .    .    .  percent  but very slow growth of population and output per capita  whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent. It was  for land assets  which was the traditional form of assets in preindustrial societies  it was typically five percent. Any reader of Jane Austen would know that. If you want an annual income of       pounds  you should have a capital value of        pounds so that five percent of        is      . And in a way  this was the very foundation of society  because r bigger than g was what allowed holders of wealth and assets to live off their capital income and to do something else in life than just to care about their own survival. Now  one important conclusion of my historical research is that modern industrial growth did not change this basic fact as much as one might have expected. Of course  the growth rate following the Industrial Revolution rose  typically from zero to one to two percent  but at the same time  the rate of return to capital also rose so that the gap between the two did not really change. So during the   th century  you had a very unique combination of events. First  a very low rate of return due to the      and      war shocks  destruction of wealth  inflation  bankruptcy during the Great Depression  and all of this reduced the private rate of return to wealth to unusually low levels between      and     . And then  in the postwar period  you had unusually high growth rate  partly due to the reconstruction. You know  in Germany  in France  in Japan  you had five percent growth rate between      and      largely due to reconstruction  and also due to very large demographic growth  the Baby Boom Cohort effect. Now  apparently that's not going to last for very long  or at least the population growth is supposed to decline in the future  and the best projections we have is that the long run growth is going to be closer to one to two percent rather than four to five percent. So if you look at this  these are the best estimates we have of world GDP growth and rate of return on capital  average rates of return on capital  so you can see that during most of the history of mankind  the growth rate was very small  much lower than the rate of return  and then during the   th century  it is really the population growth  very high in the postwar period  and the reconstruction process that brought growth to a smaller gap with the rate of return. Here I use the United Nations population projections  so of course they are uncertain. It could be that we all start having a lot of children in the future  and the growth rates are going to be higher  but from now on  these are the best projections we have  and this will make global growth decline and the gap between the rate of return go up. Now  the other unusual event during the   th century was  as I said  destruction  taxation of capital  so this is the pre tax rate of return. This is the after tax rate of return  and after destruction  and this is what brought the average rate of return after tax  after destruction  below the growth rate during a long time period. But without the destruction  without the taxation  this  would not have happened. So let me say that the balance between returns on capital and growth depends on many different factors that are very difficult to predict  technology and the development of capital intensive techniques. So right now  the most capital intensive sectors in the economy are the real estate sector  housing  the energy sector  but it could be in the future that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors and that this would be a bigger share of the total capital stock that it is today. Well  we are very far from this  and from now  what's going on in the real estate sector  the energy sector  is much more important for the total capital stock and capital share. The other important issue is that there are scale effects in portfolio management  together with financial complexity  financial deregulation  that make it easier to get higher rates of return for a large portfolio  and this seems to be particularly strong for billionaires  large capital endowments. Just to give you one example  this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings over the           period  and you can see the very top wealth holders have been going up at six  seven percent per year in real terms above inflation  whereas average income in the world  average wealth in the world  have increased at only two percent per year. And you find the same for large university endowments   the bigger the initial endowments  the bigger the rate of return. Now  what could be done  The first thing is that I think we need more financial transparency. We know too little about global wealth dynamics  so we need international transmission of bank information. We need a global registry of financial assets  more coordination on wealth taxation  and even wealth tax with a small tax rate will be a way to produce information so that then we can adapt our policies to whatever we observe. And to some extent  the fight against tax havens and automatic transmission of information is pushing us in this direction. Now  there are other ways to redistribute wealth  which it can be tempting to use. Inflation  it's much easier to print money than to write a tax code  so that's very tempting  but sometimes you don't know what you do with the money. This is a problem. Expropriation is very tempting. Just when you feel some people get too wealthy  you just expropriate them. But this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics. So war is an even less efficient way  so I tend to prefer progressive taxation  but of course  history    Laughter    history will invent its own best ways  and it will probably involve a combination of all of these. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thomas Piketty. Thank you. Thomas  I want to ask you two or three questions  because it's impressive how you're in command of your data  of course  but basically what you suggest is growing wealth concentration is kind of a natural tendency of capitalism  and if we leave it to its own devices  it may threaten the system itself  so you're suggesting that we need to act to implement policies that redistribute wealth  including the ones we just saw  progressive taxation  etc. In the current political context  how realistic are those  How likely do you think that it is that they will be implemented  Thomas Piketty  Well  you know  I think if you look back through time  the history of income  wealth and taxation is full of surprise. So I am not terribly impressed by those who know in advance what will or will not happen. I think one century ago  many people would have said that progressive income taxation would never happen and then it happened. And even five years ago  many people would have said that bank secrecy will be with us forever in Switzerland  that Switzerland was too powerful for the rest of the world  and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions against Swiss banks for a big change to happen  and now we are moving toward more financial transparency. So I think it's not that difficult to better coordinate politically. We are going to have a treaty with half of the world GDP around the table with the U.S. and the European Union  so if half of the world GDP is not enough to make progress on financial transparency and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits  what does it take  So I think these are not technical difficulties. I think we can make progress if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions and we have the proper sanctions on those who benefit from financial opacity. BG  One of the arguments against your point of view is that economic inequality is not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines. So we take measures to lower inequality  and at the same time we lower growth  potentially. What do you answer to that  TP  Yeah  I think inequality is not a problem per se. I think inequality up to a point can actually be useful for innovation and growth. The problem is  it's a question of degree. When inequality gets too extreme  then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetuation of inequality over time and low mobility. And for instance  the kind of wealth concentrations that we had in the   th century and pretty much until World War I in every European country was  I think  not useful for growth. This was destroyed by a combination of tragic events and policy changes  and this did not prevent growth from happening. And also  extreme inequality can be bad for our democratic institutions if it creates very unequal access to political voice  and the influence of private money in U.S. politics  I think  is a matter of concern right now. So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme  pre World War I inequality. Having a decent share of the national wealth for the middle class is not bad for growth. It is actually useful both for equity and efficiency reasons. BG  I said at the beginning that your book has been criticized. Some of your data has been criticized. Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized. You have been accused of cherry picking data to make your case. What do you answer to that  TP  Well  I answer that I am very happy that this book is stimulating debate. This is part of what it is intended for. Look  the reason why I put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that we can have  an open and transparent debate about this. So I have responded point by point to every concern. Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today  I would actually conclude that the rise in wealth inequality  particularly in the United States  has been actually higher than what I report in my book. There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman showing  with new data which I didn't have at the time of the book  that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen even more than what I report. And there will be other data in the future. Some of it will go in different directions. Look  we put online almost every week new  updated series on the World Top Income Database and we will keep doing so in the future  in particular in emerging countries  and I welcome all of those who want to contribute to this data collection process. In fact  I certainly agree that there is not enough transparency about wealth dynamics  and a good way to have better data would be to have a wealth tax with a small tax rate to begin with so that we can all agree about this important evolution and adapt our policies to whatever we observe. So taxation is a source of knowledge  and that's what we need the most right now. BG  Thomas Piketty  merci beaucoup. Thank you. TP  Thank you.  Applause  This is my niece  Stella. She's just turned one and started to walk. And she's walking in that really cool way that one year olds do  a kind of teetering  my body's moving  too fast for my legs kind of way. It is absolutely gorgeous. And one of her favorite  things to do at the moment is to stare at herself in the mirror. She absolutely loves her reflection. She giggles and squeals  and gives herself these big  wet kisses. It is beautiful. Apparently  all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this  and it got me thinking  When did I stop doing this  When is it suddenly not okay to love  the way that we look  Because apparently we don't. Ten thousand people every month google   Am I ugly   This is Faye. Faye is    and she  lives in Denver. And like any teenager  she just wants to  be liked and to fit in. It's Sunday night. She's getting ready for the week ahead at school. And she's slightly dreading it  and  she's a bit confused because despite her mom telling her all the time that she's beautiful  every day at school  someone tells her  that she's ugly. Because of the difference between what her mom  tells her and what her friends at school  or her peers at school are telling her  she doesn't know who to believe. So  she takes a video of herself.  She posts it to YouTube and she asks people to please leave  a comment   Am I pretty or am I ugly   Well  so far  Faye has received  over        comments. Some of them are so nasty  they don't  bear thinking about. This is an average  healthy looking  teenage girl receiving this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life. Thousands of people are posting videos like this  mostly teenage girls  reaching out in this way. But what's leading them to do this  Well  today's teenagers are rarely alone. They're under pressure to be online and available at all times  talking  messaging  liking  commenting   sharing  posting   it never ends. Never before have we been so connected  so continuously  so instantaneously  so young. And as one mom told me  it's like there's a party in their bedroom every night. There's simply no privacy. And the social pressures that go along  with that are relentless. This always on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they receive. There's no separation between online and offline life. What's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between. And it's also really hard to tell the difference  between what's authentic and what's digitally manipulated. What's a highlight in someone's life versus what's normal in the context of everyday. And where are they looking to for inspiration  Well  you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds of girls today. Size zero models still dominate our catwalks. Airbrushing is now routine. And trends like  thinspiration   thighgap   bikinibridge and  proana. For those who don't know   proana means pro anorexia. These trends are teamed with the  stereotyping and flagrant objectification of women in today's popular culture. It is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against. But boys are not immune to this either. Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero like sports stars and playboy music artists. But  what's the problem with all of this  Well  surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy   well balanced individuals. But in an image obsessed culture  we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on  their appearance at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities. So  things like their relationships  the development of their physical abilities  and their studies and so on begin to suffer. Six out of    girls are now choosing not to do  something because they don't think they look good enough. These are not trivial activities. These are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to  the workforce. Thirty one percent  nearly one in  three teenagers  are withdrawing from classroom debate. They're failing to engage in classroom debate because they don't want to draw attention to the  way that they look. One in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don't feel good about it. And when it comes to exams  if you don't think you look good enough  specifically if you don't think you are thin enough  you will score a lower grade point average than your peers who are not concerned with this. And this is consistent across Finland  the U.S. and China  and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh. So to be super clear  we're talking about the way you think you look  not how you actually look. Low body confidence is undermining  academic achievement. But it's also damaging health. Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity  eat less fruits and vegetables  partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders. They have lower self esteem. They're more easily influenced by people around them and they're at greater risk of depression. And we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks with things like alcohol and drug use  crash dieting  cosmetic surgery   unprotected  earlier sex  and self harm. The pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems and costing our governments billions of  dollars every year. And we don't grow out of it. Women who think they're overweight   again  regardless of whether they are or are not   have higher rates of absenteeism. Seventeen percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look. Have a think about what this is doing to our economy. If we could overcome this  what that opportunity looks like. Unlocking this potential is in the interest of every single one of us. But how do we do that  Well  talking  on its own  only gets you so far. It's not enough by itself. If you actually want to make a difference  you have to do something. And we've learned there are three key ways  The first is we have to educate for body confidence. We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome image related pressures and build their self esteem. Now  the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this. The bad news is that most of them don't work. I was shocked to learn that many well meaning programs are inadvertently actually making the situation worse. So we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving are not only having a positive impact  but having a lasting impact as well. And the research shows  that the best programs address six key areas  The first is the influence of family   friends and relationships. The second is media and celebrity culture  then how to handle teasing and bullying  the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks  talking about appearance   some people call this  body talk  or  fat talk    and finally  the foundations of respecting and looking after yourself. These six things are crucial starting points for anyone serious about delivering body confidence education that works. An education is critical  but tackling this problem is going to require each and everyone of us to step up and be better role models for the women and girls in our own lives. Challenging the status quo of how women are seen and talked about in our own circles. It is not okay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their haircuts or the size of their breasts  or to infer that the determination or the success of an Olympian is down  to her not being a looker. We need to start judging people by what they do  not what they look like. We can all start by taking responsibility  for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks. We can compliment people based on  their effort and their actions and not on their appearance. And let me ask you  when was the last time that you kissed a mirror  Ultimately  we need to work together as communities  as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valuing their  whole selves  valuing individuality  diversity  inclusion. We need to put the people that are making a real difference on our pedestals  making a difference in the real world. Giving them the airtime  because only then will we create a different world. A world where our kids are free to become the best versions of themselves  where the way they think they look never holds them back from being who they are or achieving what they want in life. Think about what this might mean  for someone in your life. Who have you got in mind  Is it your wife  Your sister  Your daughter  Your niece  Your friend  It could just be the woman  a couple of seats away from you today. What would it mean for her if she were freed from that voice of her inner critic  nagging her to have longer legs  thinner thighs  smaller stomach  shorter feet  What could it mean for her if we overcame this and unlocked her potential in that way  Right now  our culture's obsession with image is holding us all back. But let's show our kids the truth. Let's show them that the way you look is just one part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for who they are and what they do and how they make us feel. Let's build self esteem into our school curriculums. Let's each and every one of us change the way we talk and compare ourselves to other people. And let's work together as communities  from grassroots to governments  so that the happy little one year olds of today become the confident changemakers of tomorrow. Let's do this. I have the feeling that we can all agree that we're moving towards a new model of the state and society. But  we're absolutely clueless as to what this is or what it should be. It seems like we need to have a conversation about democracy in our day and age. Let's think about it this way  We are   st century citizens  doing our very  very best to interact with   th century designed institutions that are based on an information technology of the   th century. Let's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system. First of all  it's designed for an information technology that's over     years old. And the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many. And the many get to vote once every  couple of years. In the second place  the costs of participating in this system are incredibly high. You either have to have a fair  bit of money and influence  or you have to devote your entire life to politics. You have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe  one day  you'll get  to sit at a table where a decision is being made. And last but not least  the language of the system   it's incredibly cryptic. It's done for lawyers  by lawyers  and no one else can understand. So  it's a system where we can choose our authorities  but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their decisions. So  in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation  our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can  more than ever before  express our desires and our concerns. Our political system remains the same for the past     years and expects us to be contented with being  simply passive recipients of a monologue. So  it's really not surprising that this kind of system is only able to produce two kinds of results  silence or noise. Silence  in terms of citizens not engaging  simply not wanting to participate. There's this commonplace   idea  that I truly  truly dislike  and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic. That we shun commitment. But  can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend  physically  a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever  Conflict is bound to happen between a system that no longer represents  nor has any dialogue capacity  and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves. And  then we find noise  Chile  Argentina  Brazil  Mexico Italy  France  Spain  the United States  they're all democracies. Their citizens have access to the ballot boxes. But they still feel the need  they need to take to the streets in order  to be heard. To me  it seems like the   th century slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies   No taxation without representation   can now be updated to  No representation without a conversation.  We want our seat at the table. And rightly so. But in order to be part of this conversation  we need to know what we want to do next  because political action is being able to move from agitation to construction. My generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests  protests that were able to successfully impose agendas  roll back extremely pernicious legislation  and even overthrow authoritarian governments. And we should be immensely proud of this. But  we also must admit that we haven't been good at using those same networks and technologies to successfully articulate an alternative to what we're seeing and find the consensus and build  the alliances that are needed to make it happen. And so the risk that we face is that we can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers  like the military or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes. But our democracy is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years. But it's not either the ability to bring millions onto the streets. So the question I'd like to raise here  and I do believe it's the most important  question we need to answer  is this one  If Internet is the new printing press  then what is democracy for the Internet era  What institutions do we want to build for the   st century society  I don't have the answer  just in case. I don't think anyone does. But I truly believe we can't afford to ignore this question anymore. So  I'd like to share our experience and what we've learned so far and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation. Two years ago  with a group of friends from Argentina  we started thinking   how can  we get our representatives  our elected representatives  to represent us   Marshall McLuhan once said that politics is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools. So the question that motivated us was  can we try and solve some of today's problems with the tools that we use every single day of our lives  Our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called DemocracyOS. DemocracyOS is an open source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for us to participate  from our everyday lives. So first of all  you can get informed so every new project that gets introduced in Congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language on this platform. But we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information  but from doing something with it. So better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we're going to do next  and DemocracyOS allows for that. Because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences  one on top of each other  but that our healthy and robust public debate should be  once again  one of its fundamental values. So DemocracyOS is about persuading  and being persuaded. It's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement. And finally  you can vote how you would like your elected  representative to vote. And if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue  you can always delegate your vote to someone else  allowing for a dynamic and emerging social leadership. It suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in Congress. But  it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick. What we needed to do to was to find actors that were able to grab this distributed knowledge in society and use it to make better and more fair decisions. So we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them DemocracyOS. We said   Look  here you have a platform that you can use to build a two way conversation with your constituencies.  And yes  we failed. We failed big time. We were sent to play  outside like little kids. Amongst other things  we were called naive. And I must be honest  I think  in hindsight  we were. Because the challenges that we face  they're not technological  they're cultural. Political parties were never willing to change the way they make their decisions. So it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea  we needed to do it ourselves. And so we took quite a leap of faith  and in August last year  we founded our own political party  El Partido de la Red  or the Net Party  in the city of  Buenos Aires. And taking an even bigger leap of faith  we ran for elections in October last year with this idea  if we want a seat in Congress  our candidate  our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on DemocracyOS. Every single project that got introduced in Congress  we were going vote according to what citizens decided on an online platform. It was our way of hacking the political system. We understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation  to have a seat at the table  we needed to become valid stakeholders  and the only way of doing it is to play by the  system rules. But we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions. For the first time  we were making our decisions together with those who we were affecting directly by those decisions. It was a very  very bold move for a two month old party in the city of Buenos Aires. But it got attention. We got        votes  that's  .  percent of the votes  and we came in second for the local options. So  even if that wasn't enough to win a seat in Congress  it was enough for us to become part of the conversation  to the extent that next month  Congress  as an institution  is launching for the first time in Argentina's history  a DemocracyOS to discuss  with the citizens  three pieces of legislation  two on urban transportation and one on the use of public space. Of course  our elected representatives are not saying   Yes  we're going to vote according to what citizens decide   but they're willing to try. They're willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they'll be willing to listen as well. Our political system can be transformed  and not by subverting it  by destroying it  but by rewiring it with the tools that Internet affords us now. But a real challenge is to find  to design to create  to empower those connectors that are able to innovate  to transform noise and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies to the   st century. I'm not saying it's easy. But in our experience  we actually stand a chance of making it work. And in my heart  it's most definitely worth trying. Thank you. I live in Washington  D.C.  but I grew up in Sindhekela  a village in Orissa  in India. My father was a government worker. My mother could not read or write  but she would say to me   A king is  worshipped only in his own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere.  So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up. But I almost didn't go to college until an aunt offered financial help. I went to study in Sambalpur  the largest town in the region  where  already in college  I saw a television for the first time. I had dreams of going to the United States for higher studies. When the opportunity came  I crossed two oceans  with borrowed money for airfare and only a     bill in my pocket. In the U.S.  I worked in a research center  part time  while taking graduate classes in economics. And with the little I earned  I would finance myself and then I would send money home to my brother and my father. My story is not unique. There are millions of people who migrate each year. With the help of the family  they cross oceans  they cross deserts  they cross  rivers  they cross mountains. They risk their lives to realize a dream  and that dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home and help the family  which has helped them before. There are     million international  migrants in the world. These are people who live in a country other than their country of birth. If there was a country made up of only international migrants  that would be larger  in population  than Brazil. That would be larger  in its size of the economy  than France. Some     million of them  from poor countries  send money home regularly. Those sums of money are called remittances. Here is a fact that might surprise you      billion dollars      billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries. Migrants from developing countries  money sent to developing countries       billion dollars. That's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money. And yet  you and I  my colleagues in Washington  we endlessly debate and discuss about development aid  while we ignore remittances as small change. True  people send     dollars per month  on average. But  repeated month after month  by millions of people  these sums of money add up to rivers  of foreign currency. So India  last year  received     billion dollars  larger than its IT exports. In Egypt remittances are three times the size of revenues from the Suez Canal. In Tajikistan  remittances are    percent of GDP. And in poorer countries  smaller  countries  fragile countries  conflict afflicted countries  remittances are a lifeline  as in Somalia or in Haiti. No wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people. Remittances  unlike private investment money  they don't flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country. They actually act like an insurance. When the family is in trouble  facing hardship  facing hard times  remittances increase  they act like an insurance. Migrants send more money then. Unlike development aid money  that must go through official agencies  through governments  remittances directly reach the poor  reach the family  and often with business advice. So in Nepal  the share of poor people was    percent in       the share of poor people in the population. By       a decade later  at a time of political crisis  economic crisis  the share of poor people went down to    percent. That decline in poverty  most of it  about half of it  is believed to be because of remittances from India  another poor country. In El Salvador  the school dropout rate among children is lower in families that receive remittances. In Mexico and Sri Lanka  the birth weight of children is higher among families that receive remittances. Remittances are dollars wrapped with care. Migrants send money home for food  for buying necessities  for building houses  for funding education  for funding healthcare for the elderly  for business investments for friends and family. Migrants send even more money home for special occasions like a surgery or a wedding. And migrants also send money  perhaps far too many times  for unexpected funerals that they cannot attend. Much as these flows do all that good  there are barriers to these flows of remittances  these     billion dollars of remittances. Foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home. Money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor. They will say   Up to     dollars if you want to send  we will charge you    dollars fixed.  If you are poor and if you have  only     dollars to send  you have to pay that     fee. The global average cost of sending money is eight percent. That means you send     dollars  the family on the other side receives only    dollars. To send money to Africa  the cost is even higher     percent. To send money within Africa  the cost is even higher  over    percent. For example  sending money from Benin  to Nigeria. And then there is the case of Venezuela  where  because of exchange controls  you send     dollars and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even    dollars. Of course  nobody sends money to Venezuela through the official channel. It all goes in suitcases. Whereever costs are high  money goes underground. And what is worse  many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on sending money out of the country. Many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money  to specific countries. So  is it that there are no options  no better options  cheaper options  to send money  There are. M Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only    cents per transaction. U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to Mexico for a fixed cost of only    cents per transaction. And yet  these faster  cheaper  better options can't be applied internationally because of the fear of money laundering  even though there is little data to support any connection  any significant connection between money laundering and these small remittance transactions. Many international banks now are wary of hosting bank accounts of money service businesses  especially those serving Somalia. Somalia  a country where the per capita income is only     dollars per year. Monthly remittances  on average  to Somalia is larger than that amount. Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia. And yet  this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid  while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood to that economy  through regulations. Then there is the case of poor people from villages  like me. In the villages  the only place where you can get money is through the post office. Most of the governments in the world have allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies. So  if I have to send money to my father in the village  I must send money through that particular money transfer company  even if the cost is high. I cannot go to a cheaper option. This has to go. So  what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home  First  relax regulations on small remittances under       dollars. Governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering. Second  governments should abolish exclusive partnerships between their post office and the money  transfer company. For that matter  between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor. In fact  they should promote competition  open up the partnership so that we will bring down costs like we did  like they did  in the telecommunications industry. You have seen what has happened there. Third  large nonprofit philanthropic organizations should create a remittance platform on a nonprofit basis. They should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies so that they can send money at a low cost  while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world. The development community should set a goal of reducing remittance costs to one percent from the current eight percent. If we reduce costs to one percent  that would release a saving of     billion dollars per year. Thirty billion dollars  that's  larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year. That is larger than  or almost similar to  the total aid budget of the United States government  the largest donor on the planet. Actually  the savings would be larger than that    billion because remittance channels are also used for aid  trade and investment purposes. Another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment  fees that migrants pay  migrant workers pay to laborers who found them the job. I was in Dubai a few years ago. I visited a camp for workers. It was   in the evening  dark  hot  humid. Workers were coming back from their grueling day of work  and I struck a conversation with a Bangladeshi construction worker. He was preoccupied that he is sending money home  he has been sending money home for a few months now  and the money is mostly going to the recruitment agent  to the labor agent who found him that job. And in my mind  I could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance. The remittance arrives. She takes the money and hands it over to the recruitment agent  while the children are looking on. This has to stop. It is not only construction  workers from Bangladesh  it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem. A construction worker from Bangladesh  on an average  pays about        dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only        dollars per year in income. That means that for the two years or three years of his life  he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees. The family doesn't get to see any of it. It is not only Dubai  it is the dark underbelly of every major city in the world. It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers  it is workers from all over the world. It is not only men. Women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices. One of the most exciting and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is how to mobilize  through innovation  diaspora saving and diaspora giving. Migrants send money home  but they also save a large amount of money where they live. Annually  migrant savings are estimated to be     billion dollars. Most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate. If a country were to come  and offer a three percent or four percent interest rate  and then say that the money would be used for building schools  roads  airports  train systems in the country of origin  a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money because it's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country's development. Remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to migrants because when they come on a monthly basis to send remittances  that's when you can actually sell it to them. You can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving. I would love to invest in a bullet train system in India and I would love to contribute to efforts to fight malaria in my village. Remittances are a great way of sharing prosperity between places in a targeted way that benefits those who need them most. Remittances empower people. We must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper. And it can be done. As for myself  I have been away from India for two decades now. My wife is a Venezuelan. My children are Americans. Increasingly  I feel like a global citizen. And yet  I am growing nostalgic about my country of birth. I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time. My parents are not there anymore. My brothers and sisters have moved on. There is no real urgency for me to send money home. And yet  from time to time  I send money home to friends  to relatives  to the village  to be there  to stay engaged   that's part of my identity. And  I'm still striving to be a poet for the hardworking migrants and their struggle to break free of the cycle of poverty. Thank you. There is an entire genre of YouTube videos devoted to an experience which I am certain that everyone in this room has had. It entails an individual who  thinking they're alone  engages in some expressive behavior   wild singing  gyrating dancing  some mild sexual activity   only to discover that  in fact  they are not alone  that there is a person watching and lurking  the discovery of which causes them to immediately cease what they were doing in horror. The sense of shame and humiliation in their face is palpable. It's the sense of   This is something I'm willing to do only if no one else is watching.  This is the crux of the work on which I have been singularly focused for the last    months  the question of why privacy matters  a question that has arisen in the context of a global debate  enabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden that the United States and its partners  unbeknownst to the entire world  has converted the Internet  once heralded as an unprecedented tool of liberation and democratization  into an unprecedented zone of mass  indiscriminate surveillance. There is a very common sentiment that arises in this debate  even among people who are uncomfortable with mass surveillance  which says that there is no real harm that comes from this large scale invasion because only people who are engaged in bad acts have a reason to want to hide and to care about their privacy. This worldview is implicitly grounded in the proposition that there are two kinds of people in the world  good people and bad people. Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks or who engage in violent criminality and therefore have reasons to want to hide what they're doing  have reasons to care about their privacy. But by contrast  good people are people who go to work  come home  raise their children  watch television. They use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks but to read the news or exchange recipes or to plan their kids' Little League games  and those people are doing nothing wrong and therefore have nothing to hide and no reason to fear the government monitoring them. The people who are actually saying that are engaged in a very extreme act of self deprecation. What they're really saying is   I have agreed to make myself such a harmless and unthreatening and uninteresting person that I actually don't fear having the government know what it is that I'm doing.  This mindset has found what I think is its purest expression in a      interview with the longtime CEO of Google  Eric Schmidt  who  when asked about all the different ways his company is causing invasions of privacy for hundreds of millions of people around the world  said this  He said   If you're doing something that you don't want other people to know  maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.  Now  there's all kinds of things to say about that mentality  the first of which is that the people who say that  who say that privacy isn't really important  they don't actually believe it  and the way you know that they don't actually believe it is that while they say with their words that privacy doesn't matter  with their actions  they take all kinds of steps to safeguard their privacy. They put passwords on their email and their social media accounts  they put locks on their bedroom and bathroom doors  all steps designed to prevent other people from entering what they consider their private realm and knowing what it is that they don't want other people to know. The very same Eric Schmidt  the CEO of Google  ordered his employees at Google to cease speaking with the online Internet magazine CNET after CNET published an article full of personal  private information about Eric Schmidt  which it obtained exclusively through Google searches and using other Google products.  Laughter  This same division can be seen with the CEO of Facebook  Mark Zuckerberg  who in an infamous interview in      pronounced that privacy is no longer a  social norm.  Last year  Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife purchased not only their own house but also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto for a total of    million dollars in order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy that prevented other people from monitoring what they do in their personal lives. Over the last    months  as I've debated this issue around the world  every single time somebody has said to me   I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide.  I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen  I write down my email address. I say   Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts  not just the nice  respectable work one in your name  but all of them  because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online  read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all  if you're not a bad person  if you're doing nothing wrong  you should have nothing to hide.  Not a single person has taken me up on that offer. I check and    Applause  I check that email account religiously all the time. It's a very desolate place. And there's a reason for that  which is that we as human beings  even those of us who in words disclaim the importance of our own privacy  instinctively understand the profound importance of it. It is true that as human beings  we're social animals  which means we have a need for other people to know what we're doing and saying and thinking  which is why we voluntarily publish information about ourselves online. But equally essential to what it means to be a free and fulfilled human being is to have a place that we can go and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people. There's a reason why we seek that out  and our reason is that all of us   not just terrorists and criminals  all of us   have things to hide. There are all sorts of things that we do and think that we're willing to tell our physician or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse or our best friend that we would be mortified for the rest of the world to learn. We make judgments every single day about the kinds of things that we say and think and do that we're willing to have other people know  and the kinds of things that we say and think and do that we don't want anyone else to know about. People can very easily in words claim that they don't value their privacy  but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief. Now  there's a reason why privacy is so craved universally and instinctively. It isn't just a reflexive movement like breathing air or drinking water. The reason is that when we're in a state where we can be monitored  where we can be watched  our behavior changes dramatically. The range of behavioral options that we consider when we think we're being watched severely reduce. This is just a fact of human nature that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion and in virtually every field of discipline. There are dozens of psychological studies that prove that when somebody knows that they might be watched  the behavior they engage in is vastly more conformist and compliant. Human shame is a very powerful motivator  as is the desire to avoid it  and that's the reason why people  when they're in a state of being watched  make decisions not that are the byproduct of their own agency but that are about the expectations that others have of them or the mandates of societal orthodoxy. This realization was exploited most powerfully for pragmatic ends by the   th  century philosopher Jeremy Bentham  who set out to resolve an important problem ushered in by the industrial age  where  for the first time  institutions had become so large and centralized that they were no longer able to monitor and therefore control each one of their individual members  and the solution that he devised was an architectural design originally intended to be implemented in prisons that he called the panopticon  the primary attribute of which was the construction of an enormous tower in the center of the institution where whoever controlled the institution could at any moment watch any of the inmates  although they couldn't watch all of them at all times. And crucial to this design was that the inmates could not actually see into the panopticon  into the tower  and so they never knew if they were being watched or even when. And what made him so excited about this discovery was that that would mean that the prisoners would have to assume that they were being watched at any given moment  which would be the ultimate enforcer for obedience and compliance. The   th century French philosopher Michel Foucault realized that that model could be used not just for prisons but for every institution that seeks to control human behavior  schools  hospitals  factories  workplaces. And what he said was that this mindset  this framework discovered by Bentham  was the key means of societal control for modern  Western societies  which no longer need the overt weapons of tyranny   punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents  or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party   because mass surveillance creates a prison in the mind that is a much more subtle though much more effective means of fostering compliance with social norms or with social orthodoxy  much more effective than brute force could ever be. The most iconic work of literature about surveillance and privacy is the George Orwell novel         which we all learn in school  and therefore it's almost become a cliche. In fact  whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance  people instantaneously dismiss it as inapplicable  and what they say is   Oh  well in '     ' there were monitors in people's homes  they were being watched at every given moment  and that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face.  That is an actual fundamental misapprehension of the warnings that Orwell issued in      .  The warning that he was issuing was about a surveillance state not that monitored everybody at all times  but where people were aware that they could be monitored at any given moment. Here is how Orwell's narrator  Winston Smith  described the surveillance system that they faced   There was  of course  no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment.  He went on to say   At any rate  they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live  did live  from habit that became instinct  in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized.  The Abrahamic religions similarly posit that there's an invisible  all knowing authority who  because of its omniscience  always watches whatever you're doing  which means you never have a private moment  the ultimate enforcer for obedience to its dictates. What all of these seemingly disparate works recognize  the conclusion that they all reach  is that a society in which people can be monitored at all times is a society that breeds conformity and obedience and submission  which is why every tyrant  the most overt to the most subtle  craves that system. Conversely  even more importantly  it is a realm of privacy  the ability to go somewhere where we can think and reason and interact and speak without the judgmental eyes of others being cast upon us  in which creativity and exploration and dissent exclusively reside  and that is the reason why  when we allow a society to exist in which we're subject to constant monitoring  we allow the essence of human freedom to be severely crippled. The last point I want to observe about this mindset  the idea that only people who  are doing something wrong have things to hide and therefore reasons to care about privacy  is that it entrenches two very destructive messages  two destructive lessons  the first of which is that the only people who care about privacy  the only people who will seek out privacy  are by definition bad people. This is a conclusion that we should have all kinds of reasons for avoiding  the most important of which is that when you say   somebody who is doing bad things   you probably mean things like plotting a terrorist attack or engaging in violent criminality  a much narrower conception of what people who wield power mean when they say   doing bad things.  For them   doing bad things  typically means doing something that poses meaningful challenges to the exercise of our own power. The other really destructive and  I think  even more insidious lesson that comes from accepting this mindset is there's an implicit bargain that people who accept this mindset have accepted  and that bargain is this  If you're willing to render yourself sufficiently harmless  sufficiently unthreatening to those who wield political power  then and only then can you be free of the dangers of surveillance. It's only those who are dissidents  who challenge power  who have something to worry about. There are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well. You may be a person who  right now  doesn't want to engage in that behavior  but at some point in the future you might. Even if you're somebody who decides that you never want to  the fact that there are other people who are willing to and able to resist and be adversarial to those in power   dissidents and journalists and activists and a whole range of others   is something that brings us all collective good that we should want to preserve. Equally critical is that the measure of how free a society is is not how it treats its good  obedient  compliant citizens  but how it treats its dissidents and those who resist orthodoxy. But the most important reason is that a system of mass surveillance suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways. It renders off limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it's happened. The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg once said   He who does not move does not notice his chains.  We can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable  but the constraints that it imposes on us do not become any less potent. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Glenn  thank you. The case is rather convincing  I have to say  but I want to bring you back to the last    months and to Edward Snowden for a few questions  if you don't mind. The first one is personal to you. We have all read about the arrest of your partner  David Miranda in London  and other difficulties  but I assume that in terms of personal engagement and risk  that the pressure on you is not that easy to take on the biggest sovereign  organizations in the world. Tell us a little bit about that. Glenn Greenwald  You know  I think one of the things that happens is that people's courage in this regard gets contagious  and so although I and the other journalists with whom I was working were certainly aware of the risk   the United States continues to be the most powerful country in the world and doesn't appreciate it when you disclose thousands of their secrets on the Internet at will   seeing somebody who is a    year old ordinary person who grew up in a very ordinary environment exercise the degree of principled courage that Edward Snowden risked  knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life or that his life would unravel  inspired me and inspired other journalists and inspired  I think  people around the world  including future whistleblowers  to realize that they can engage in that kind of behavior as well. BG  I'm curious about your relationship with Ed Snowden  because you have spoken with him a lot  and you certainly continue doing so  but in your book  you never call him Edward  nor Ed  you say  Snowden.  How come  GG  You know  I'm sure that's something for a team of psychologists to examine.  Laughter  I don't really know. The reason I think that  one of the important objectives that he actually had  one of his  I think  most important tactics  was that he knew that one of the ways to distract attention from the substance of the revelations would be to try and personalize the focus on him  and for that reason  he stayed out of the media. He tried not to ever have his personal life subject to examination  and so I think calling him Snowden is a way of just identifying him as this important historical actor rather than trying to personalize him in a way that might distract attention from the substance. Moderator  So his revelations  your analysis  the work of other journalists  have really developed the debate  and many governments  for example  have reacted  including in Brazil  with projects and programs to reshape a little bit the design of the Internet  etc. There are a lot of things going on in that sense. But I'm wondering  for you personally  what is the endgame  At what point will you think  well  actually  we've succeeded  in moving the dial  GG  Well  I mean  the endgame for me as a journalist is very simple  which is to make sure that every single document that's newsworthy and that ought to be disclosed ends up being disclosed  and that secrets that should never have been kept in the first place end up uncovered. To me  that's the essence of journalism and that's what I'm committed to doing. As somebody who finds mass surveillance odious for all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more  I mean  I look at this as work that will never end until governments around the world are no longer able to subject entire populations to monitoring and surveillance unless they convince some court or some entity that the person they've targeted has actually done something wrong. To me  that's the way that privacy can be rejuvenated. BG  So Snowden is very  as we've seen at TED  is very articulate in presenting and portraying himself as a defender of democratic values and democratic principles. But then  many people really  find it difficult to believe that those are his only motivations. They find it difficult to believe that there was no money involved  that he didn't sell some of those secrets  even to China and to Russia  which are clearly not the best friends of the United States right now. And I'm sure many people in the room are wondering the same question. Do you consider it possible there is that part of Snowden we've not seen yet  GG  No  I consider that absurd and idiotic. and I know you're just playing devil's advocate  but if you wanted to sell secrets to another country  which he could have done and become extremely rich doing so  the last thing you would  do is take those secrets and give them to journalists and ask journalists to publish them  because it makes those secrets worthless. People who want to enrich themselves do it secretly by selling  secrets to the government  but I think there's one important point worth making  which is  that accusation comes from people in the U.S. government  from people in the media who are loyalists to these various governments  and I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people    Oh  he can't really be doing this for principled reasons  he must have some corrupt  nefarious reason    they're saying a lot more about themselves than they are the target of their accusations  because    Applause    those people  the ones who make that accusation  they themselves never act for any reason other than corrupt reasons  so they assume that everybody else is plagued by the same disease of soullessness as they are  and so that's the assumption. BG  Glenn  thank you very much. GG  Thank you very much. BG  Glenn Greenwald. Sleep. It's something we spend about a third of our lives doing  but do any of us really understand what it's all about  Two thousand years ago  Galen  one of the most prominent medical researchers of the ancient world  proposed that while we're awake  our brain's motive force  its juice  would flow out to all the other parts of the body  animating them but leaving the brain all dried up  and he thought that when we sleep  all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back  rehydrating the brain and refreshing the mind. Now  that sounds completely ridiculous to us now  but Galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that we all deal with every day. See  we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep  it clears your mind  and when you don't sleep  it leaves your mind murky. But while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when Galen was around  we still haven't understood why it is that sleep  of all of our activities  has this incredible restorative function for the mind. So today I want to tell you about some recent research that may shed new light on this question. We've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution to some of the brain's most basic needs  a unique way that the brain meets the high demands and the narrow margins that set it apart from all the other organs of the body. So almost all the biology that we observe can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions  and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body. In the brain  that is especially critical  its intense electrical activity uses up a quarter of the body's entire energy supply  even though the brain accounts for only about two percent of the body's mass. So the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body. You can actually see it in this video here. Here  we're imaging blood vessels in the brain of a living mouse. The blood vessels form a complex network that fills the entire brain volume. They start at the surface of the brain  and then they dive down into the tissue itself  and as they spread out  they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain. Now  just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it  every cell also produces waste as a byproduct  and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve. This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system  which has evolved to meet this need. It's a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body. It takes up proteins and other waste from the spaces between the cells  it collects them  and then dumps them into the blood so they can be disposed of. But if you look really closely at this diagram  you'll see something that doesn't make a lot of sense. So if we were to zoom into this guy's head  one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain. But that doesn't make a lot of sense  does it  I mean  the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared. And yet  it lacks lymphatic vessels  which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste won't work in the brain. So how  then  does the brain solve its waste clearance problem  Well  that seemingly mundane question is where our group first jumped into this story  and what we found as we dove down into the brain  down among the neurons and the blood vessels  was that the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance  it was really unexpected. It was ingenious  but it was also beautiful. Let me tell you about what we found. So the brain has this large pool of clean  clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid. We call it the CSF. The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain  and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the CSF  which gets dumped  along with  the waste  into the blood. So in that way  it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system  doesn't it  But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain  they don't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of CSF. Instead  there is a specialized network of plumbing that organizes and facilitates this process. You can see that in these videos. Here  we're again imaging into the brain of living mice. The frame on your left shows what's happening at the brain's surface  and the frame on your right shows what's happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself. We've labeled the blood vessels in red  and the CSF that's surrounding the brain will be in green. Now  what was surprising to us was that the fluid on the outside of the brain  it didn't stay on the outside. Instead  the CSF was pumped back into and through the brain along the outsides of the blood vessels  and as it flushed down into the brain along the outsides of these vessels  it was actually helping to clear away  to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain's cells. If you think about it  using the outsides of these blood vessels like this is a really clever design solution  because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it's packed full of cells  so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system. Yet the blood vessels  they extend from the surface of the brain down to reach every single cell in the brain  which means that fluid that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume  so it's actually this really clever way to repurpose one set of vessels  the blood vessels  to take over and replace the function of a second set of vessels  the lymphatic vessels  to make it so you don't need them. And what's amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells. This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain. But our most surprising finding was that all of this  everything I just told you about  with all this fluid rushing through the brain  it's only happening in the sleeping brain. Here  the video on the left shows how much of the CSF is moving through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake. It's almost nothing. Yet in the same animal  if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep  what we see is that the CSF is rushing through the brain  and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep  the brain cells themselves seem to shrink  opening up spaces in between them  allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out. So it seems that Galen may actually have been sort of on the right track when he wrote about fluid rushing through the brain when sleep came on. Our own research  now it's       years later  suggests that what's happening is that when the brain is awake and is at its most busy  it puts off clearing away the waste from the spaces between its cells until later  and then  when it goes to sleep and doesn't have to be as busy  it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode to clear away the waste from the spaces between its cells  the waste that's accumulated throughout the day. So it's actually a little bit like how you or I  we put off our household chores during the work week when we don't have time to get to it  and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around. Now  I've just talked a lot about waste clearance  but I haven't been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing during sleep in order to stay healthy. The waste product that these recent studies focused most on is amyloid beta  which is a protein that's made in the brain all the time. My brain's making amyloid beta right now  and so is yours. But in patients with Alzheimer's disease  amyloid beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain's cells  instead of being cleared away  like it's supposed to be  and it's this buildup of amyloid beta that's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease. So we measured how fast amyloid beta is cleared from the brain when it's awake versus when it's asleep  and we found that indeed  the clearance of amyloid beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain. So if sleep  then  is part of the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance  then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep  amyloid beta  and Alzheimer's disease. A series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease  worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid beta building up in the brain  and while it's important to point out that these studies don't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause Alzheimer's disease  they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid beta may contribute to the development of conditions like Alzheimer's. So what this new research tells us  then  is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep  that even Galen understood about sleep  that it refreshes and clears the mind  may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about. See  you and I  we go to sleep every single night  but our brains  they never rest. While our body is still and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere  the elegant machinery of the brain is quietly hard at work cleaning and maintaining this unimaginably complex machine. Like our housework  it's a dirty and a thankless job  but it's also important. In your house  if you stop cleaning your kitchen for a month  your home will become completely unlivable very quickly. But in the brain  the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty countertops  because when it comes to cleaning the brain  it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that's at stake  which is why understanding these very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow. Thank you. So imagine that a plane is about to crash with     children and babies  and if you knew how to stop that  would you  Now imagine that    planes full of babies under five crash every single day. That's the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday.  .  million children never make it to their fifth birthday. Most of these deaths are preventable  and that doesn't just make me sad  it makes me angry  and it makes me determined. Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five  and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn't some smart  new technological innovations. It's one of the world's oldest inventions  a bar of soap. Washing hands with soap  a habit we all take for granted  can reduce diarrhea by half  can reduce respiratory infections by one third. Handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu  trachoma  SARS  and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak  one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school. It stops babies from dying. Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost effective ways of saving children's lives. It can save over         children every year. That's the equivalent of stopping    jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day. I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty useful public health intervention. So now just take a minute. I think you need to get to know the person next to you. Why don't you just shake their hands. Please shake their hands. All right  get to know each other. They look really pretty. All right. So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn't wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet   Laughter  They don't look so pretty anymore  right  Pretty yucky  you would agree with me. Well  statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet  globally. And the same way  we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets  running water  and soap available  it's the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high. What is it  Is there no soap  Actually  soap is available. In    percent of households in India     percent of households in Kenya  you will find soap. Even in countries where soap is the lowest  like Ethiopia  we are at    percent. So why is it  Why aren't people washing their hands  Why is it that Mayank  this young boy that I met in India  isn't washing his hands  Well  in Mayank's family  soap is used for bathing  soap is used for laundry  soap is used for washing dishes. His parents think sometimes it's a precious commodity  so they'll keep it in a cupboard. They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it. On average  in Mayank's family  they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best  and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap. What's the result of that  Children pick up disease in the place that's supposed to love them and protect them the most  in their homes. Think about where you learned to wash your hands. Did you learn to wash your hands at home  Did you learn to wash your hands in school  I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it's very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life. However  we all copy what everyone else does  and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior  and this is where the private sector comes in. Every second in Asia and Africa      mothers will buy this bar to protect their family. Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene  diseases  from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand. Iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products. It's that belief  plus the scale of Unilever  that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers. Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn. Think about it  Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other. And actually  they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages. Just for a minute  imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap. The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world. But it's been happening for centuries  the Lifebuoy brand was launched in      in Victorian England to actually combat cholera. Last week  I was in Ghana with the minister of health  because if you don't know  there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment. A hundred and eighteen years later  the solution is exactly the same  It's about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap  and that they're using it  because that's the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading. I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful  sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government. Government is doing what they can  especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera  or Ebola at the moment  but with competing priorities. The budget is not always there. And when you think about this  you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit  it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior. In short  those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap. We have friends like USAID  the Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap  London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  Plan  WaterAid  that all believe for a win win win partnership. Win for the public sector  because we help them reach their targets. Win for the private sector  because we build new generations of future handwashers. And most importantly  win for the most vulnerable. On October     we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day. Schools  communities  our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector   yes  on that day even our competitors  we all join hands to celebrate the world's most important public health intervention. What's required  and again where the private sector can make a huge difference  is coming up with this big  creative thinking that drives advocacy. If you take our Help a Child Reach   campaign  we've created great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them. We've had over    million views. Most of these discussions are still happening online. I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films. I come from Mali  one of the world's poorest countries. I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice. I trained in Europe's premier school of public health. I think I'm probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health  and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap. Nine years ago  I decided  with a successful public health career in the making  that I could make the biggest impact coming  selling and promoting the world's best invention in public health  soap. We run today the world's largest handwashing program by any public health standards. We've reached over     million people in    countries. My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by     . Over the last four years  business has grown double digits  whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased. It may be uncomfortable for some to hear   business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence   but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more. Without it  and without talking about it  we cannot achieve the change that we need. Last week  my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing  the death of a newborn. I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful and more painful. This one is from Myanmar. She had the most beautiful smile  the smile  I think  that life gives you when you've had a second chance. Her son  Myo  is her second one. She had a daughter who passed away at three weeks  and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life  and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant  and that if soap is used  before touching the babies  we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers. And that's what inspires me  inspires me to continue in this mission  to know that I can equip her with what's needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world  nurturing her newborn. And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family  don't look far  buy her soap. It's the most beautiful invention in public health. I hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like Myo reach their fifth birthday. Thank you. Almost a year ago  my aunt started suffering back pains. She went to see the doctor and they told her it was a normal injury for someone who had been playing tennis for almost    years. They recommended that she do some therapy  but after a while she wasn't feeling better  so the doctors decided to do further tests. They did an x ray and discovered an injury in her lungs  and at the time they thought that the injury was a strain in the muscles and tendons between her ribs  but after a few weeks of treatment  again her health wasn't getting any better. So finally  they decided to do a biopsy  and two weeks later  the results of the biopsy came back. It was stage   lung cancer. Her lifestyle was almost free of risk. She never smoked a cigarette  she never drank alcohol  and she had been playing sports for almost half her life. Perhaps  that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed. My story might be  unfortunately  familiar to most of you. One out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer  and one out of four will die because of it. Not only did that cancer diagnosis change the life of our family  but that process of going back and forth with new tests  different doctors describing symptoms  discarding diseases over and over  was stressful and frustrating  especially for my aunt. And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done since the beginning of history. We have   st century medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer  but we still have   th century procedures and processes for diagnosis  if any. Today  most of us have to wait for symptoms to indicate that something is wrong. Today  the majority of people still don't have access to early cancer detection methods  even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against it. We know that we can change this in our lifetime  and that is why my team and I have decided to begin this journey  this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages and monitoring the appropriate  response at the molecular level easier  cheaper  smarter and more accessible than ever before. The context  of course  is that we're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates  and the biological realm is no exception. It is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster than the growth rate of the processing power of computers. But progress in biotech is not only being accelerated  it is also being democratized. Just as personal computers or the Internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship  politics or education  recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well  and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches. We are a team of scientists and technologists from Chile  Panama  Mexico  Israel and Greece  and based on recent scientific discoveries  we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample. We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called microRNAs. To explain what microRNAs are and their important role in cancer  I need to start with proteins  because when cancer is present in our body  protein modification is observed in all cancerous cells. As you might know  proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body  like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating DNA  but before a protein is expressed or produced  relevant parts of its genetic code present in the DNA are copied into the messenger RNA  so this messenger RNA has instructions on how to build a specific protein  and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins  but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are microRNAs. So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression. Unlike DNA  which is mainly fixed  microRNAs can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time  telling us which genes are actively  expressed at that particular moment. And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer  because as you know  cancer is a disease of altered gene expression. It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes. Another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same  but at the microRNA level  there are patterns. Several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microRNA expression levels varies and creates a unique  specific pattern for each type of cancer  even at the early stages  reflecting the progression of the disease  and whether it's responding to medication or in remission  making microRNAs a perfect  highly sensitive biomarker. However  the problem with microRNAs is that we cannot use existing DNA based technology to detect them in a reliable way  because they are very short sequences of nucleotides  much smaller than DNA. And also  all microRNAs are very similar to each other  with just tiny differences. So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules  extremely similar  extremely small. We believe that we have found a way to do so  and this is the first time that we've shown it in public. Let me do a demonstration. Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test  a lab technician extracts a total RNA  which is quite simple today  and puts it in a standard     well plate like this one. Each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign  that is looking for a specific microRNA  acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample  and when it does  it will shine with green color. To run the reaction  you put the plate inside a device like this one  and then you can put your smartphone on top of it. If we can have a camera here so you can see my screen. A smartphone is a connected computer and it's also a camera  good enough for our purpose. The smartphone is taking pictures  and when the reaction is over  it will send the pictures to our online database for processing and interpretation. This entire process lasts around    minutes  but when the process is over  wells that shine are matched  with the specific microRNAs and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine. And then  when this entire process is over  this is what happens. This chart is showing the specific microRNAs present in this sample and how they reacted over time. Then  if we take this specific pattern of microRNA of this person's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microRNA patterns with a specific presence of a disease  this is how pancreatic cancer looks like. This inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer. Another important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud  so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information. If we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer  we need to stop treating them as acute  isolated episodes  and consider and measure everything that affects our health on a permanent basis. This entire platform is a working prototype. It uses state of the art molecular biology  a low cost   D printed device  and data science to try to tackle one of humanity's  toughest challenges. Since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized  this entire solution costs at least    times less than current available methods  and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more  so we're making the design of the device open source. Let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages  but so far  we have been able to successfully identify the microRNA pattern of pancreatic cancer  lung cancer  breast cancer and hepatic cancer. And currently  we're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center with     women for breast cancer. This is the single non invasive  accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done. Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns in your blood at any given time  you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for. You don't need to have any symptoms. You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools. Today  cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear. That is  at stage   or    and I believe that is too late. It is too expensive for our families. It is too expensive for humanity. We cannot lose the war against cancer. It not only costs us billions of dollars  but it also costs us the people we love. Today  my aunt  she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude. However  I want fights like this to become very rare. I want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages  and I'm certain that in the very near future  because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences  the way we see cancer will radically change. It will give us the chance of detecting it early  understanding it better  and finding a cure. Thank you very much. So I started working with refugees because I wanted to make a difference  and making a difference starts with telling their stories. So when I meet refugees  I always ask them questions. Who bombed your house  Who killed your son  Did the rest of your family make it out alive  How are you coping in your life in exile  But there's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing  and that is  What did you take  What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town  and the armed gangs were approaching your house  A Syrian refugee boy I know told me that he didn't hesitate when his life was in imminent danger. He took his high school diploma  and later he told me why. He said   I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it.  And he would risk his life to get that diploma. On his way to school  he would dodge snipers. His classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling  and his mother told me   Every day  I would say to him every morning  'Honey  please don't go to school.'  And when he insisted  she said   I would hug him as if it were for the last time.  But he said to his mother   We're all afraid  but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear.  But one day  the family got terrible news. Hany's aunt  his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house. Their throats were slit. It was time to flee. They left that day  right away  in their car  Hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers. And they would cross the border into Lebanon  where they would find peace. But they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony. They had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field  and this is Hany's brother Ashraf  who plays outside. And that day  they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world  in a country  Lebanon  that is tiny. It only has four million citizens  and there are one million Syrian refugees living there. There's not a town  a city or a village that is not host to Syrian refugees. This is generosity and humanity that is remarkable. Think about it this way  proportionately. It would be as if the entire population of Germany     million people  would flee to the United States in just three years. Half of the entire population of Syria is now uprooted  most of them inside the country. Six and a half million people have fled for their lives. Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries  and only a small proportion  as you see  have moved on to Europe. What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children. I took this picture of this little girl. It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan. And most troubling of all is that only    percent of  Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon. And yet  Syrian refugee children  all refugee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives. Why  Because it allows them to think of their future rather than the nightmare of their past. It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred. I'm reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq  and I met this girl  and I thought   She's beautiful   and I went up to her and asked her   Can I take your picture   And she said yes  but she refused to smile. I think she couldn't  because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children  a generation isolated and frustrated. And yet  look at what they fled  utter destruction  buildings  industries  schools  roads  homes. Hany's home was also destroyed. This will need to be rebuilt by architects  by engineers  by electricians. Communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge. Shouldn't this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake  the societies in exile  the refugees  Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return. You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state. Well far from it. With wars going on and on  the average time a refugee will spend in exile is    years. Hany was into his second year in limbo when I went to visit him recently  and we conducted our entire conversation in English  which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of Dan Brown's novels and from listening to American rap. We also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf. But I'll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day. He said to me   If I am not a student  I am nothing.  Hany is one of    million people uprooted in this world today. Never since World War II have so many people been forcibly displaced. So while we're making sweeping progress in human health  in technology  in education and design  we are doing dangerously little to help the victims and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes. And there are more and more victims. Every day  on average  by the end of this day         people will be forcibly displaced from their homes          people. They flee across borders like this one. We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan  and this is a typical day. Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats  risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe. This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized   most of the people drowned   and he told us   Syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you  where nobody humiliates you  and where nobody kills you.  Well  I think that should be the minimum. How about a place of healing  of learning  and even opportunity  Americans and Europeans have the impression that proportionally huge numbers of refugees are coming to their country  but the reality is that    percent  the vast majority of refugees  are living in the developing world  in countries struggling with their own insecurity  with their own issues of helping their own populations and poverty. So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees. And all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border. Thank you. But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive. We can help them thrive. We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end. Rather  as centers of excellence  where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation. It makes so much sense  but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia that has been raging on for    years. And imagine living in this camp. I visited this camp. It's in Djibouti  neighboring Somalia  and it was so remote that we had to take a helicopter to fly there. It was dusty and it was terribly hot. And we went to visit a school and started talking to the children  and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own daughter  and I went up and talked to her. And I asked her the questions that grown ups ask kids  like   What is your favorite subject   and   What do you want to be when you grow up   And this is when her face turned blank  and she said to me   I have no future. My schooling days are over.  And I thought  there must be some misunderstanding  so I turned to my colleague and she confirmed to me there is no funding for secondary education in this camp. And how I wished at that moment that I could say to her   We will build you a school.  And I also thought  what a waste. She should be and she is the future of Somalia. A boy named Jacob Atem had a different chance  but not before he experienced terribly tragedy. He watched   this is in Sudan   as his village   he was only seven years old   burned to the ground  and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day. Only his cousin survived  and the two of them walked for seven months   this is boys like him   chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs  and they finally made it to refugee camps where they found safety  and he would spend the next seven years in Kenya in a refugee camp. But his life changed when he got the chance to be resettled to the United States  and he found love in a foster family and he was able to go to school  and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university. I spoke to him on Skype the other day  and he was in his new university in Florida pursuing his Ph.D. in public health  and he proudly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the American public to establish a health clinic back in his village back home. So I want to take you back to Hany. When I told him I was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the TED stage  he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me. He wrote   I miss myself  my friends  times of reading novels or writing poems  birds and tea in the morning. My room  my books  myself  and everything that was making me smile. Oh  oh  I had so many dreams that were about to be realized.  So here is my point  Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity. Leave them abandoned  and they risk exploitation and abuse  and leave them unskilled and uneducated  and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries. I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world. The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace  and it's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence. Hany is at a tipping point. We would love to help him go to university and to become an engineer  but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life  tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets  food rations and a bit of medicine. University is a luxury. But leave him to languish in this muddy field  and he will become a member of a lost generation. Hany's story is a tragedy  but it doesn't have to end that way. Thank you. I know a man who soars above the city every night. In his dreams  he twirls and swirls with his toes kissing the Earth. Everything has motion  he claims  even a body as paralyzed as his own. This man is my father. Three years ago  when I found out that my father had suffered a severe stroke in his brain stem  I walked into his room in the ICU at the Montreal Neurological Institute and found him lying deathly still  tethered to a breathing machine. Paralysis had closed over his body slowly  beginning in his toes  then legs  torso  fingers and arms. It made its way up his neck  cutting off his ability to breathe  and stopped just beneath the eyes. He never lost consciousness. Rather  he watched from within as his body shut down  limb by limb  muscle by muscle. In that ICU room  I walked up to my father's body  and with a quivering voice and through tears  I began reciting the alphabet. A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K. At K  he blinked his eyes. I began again. A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I. He blinked again at the letter I  then at T  then at R  and A  Kitra. He said  Kitra  my beauty  don't cry. This is a blessing.  There was no audible voice  but my father called out my name powerfully. Just    hours after his stroke  he had already embraced the totality of his condition. Despite his extreme physical state  he was completely present with me  guiding  nurturing  and being my father as much if not more than ever before. Locked in syndrome is many people's worst nightmare. In French  it's sometimes called  maladie de l'emmur  vivant.  Literally   walled in alive disease.  For many people  perhaps most  paralysis is an unspeakable horror  but my father's experience losing every system of his body was not an experience of feeling trapped  but rather of turning the psyche inwards  dimming down the external chatter  facing the recesses of his own mind  and in that place  falling in love with life and body anew. As a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body  life and death  the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him. He realized he no longer needed to look beyond the corporeal world in order to find the divine.  Paradise is in this body. It's in this world   he said. I slept by my father's side for the first four months  tending as much as I could to his every discomfort  understanding the deep  human psychological fear of not being able to call out for help. My mother  sisters  brother and I  we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing. We became his mouthpiece  spending hours each day reciting the alphabet as he whispered back sermons and poetry with blinks of his eye. His room  it became our temple of healing. His bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel  and through us  my father was able to speak and uplift  letter by letter  blink by blink. Everything in our world became slow and tender as the din  drama and death of the hospital ward faded into the background. I want to read to you one of the first things that we transcribed in the week following the stroke. He composed a letter  addressing his synagogue congregation  and ended it with the following lines   When my nape exploded  I entered another dimension  inchoate  sub planetary  protozoan. Universes are opened and closed continually. There are many when low  who stop growing. Last week  I was brought so low  but I felt the hand of my father around me  and my father brought me back.  When we weren't his voice  we were his legs and arms. I moved them like I know I would have wanted my own arms and legs to be moved were they still for all the hours of the day. I remember I'd hold his fingers near my face  bending each joint to keep it soft and limber. I'd ask him again and again to visualize the motion  to watch from within as the finger curled and extended  and to move along with it in his mind. Then  one day  from the corner of my eye  I saw his body slither like a snake  an involuntary spasm passing through the course of his limbs. At first  I thought it was my own hallucination  having spent so much time tending to this one body  so desperate to see anything react on its own. But he told me he felt tingles  sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of the skin. The following week  he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance. Connections were being made. Body was slowly and gently reawakening  limb by limb  muscle by muscle  twitch by twitch. As a documentary photographer  I felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn. I photographed him taking his first unaided breath  the celebratory moment after he showed muscle resistance for the very first time  the new adapted technologies that allowed him to gain more and more independence. I photographed the care and the love that surrounded him. But my photographs only told the outside story of a man lying in a hospital bed attached to a breathing machine. I wasn't able to portray his story from within  and so I began to search for a new visual language  one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience. Finally  I want to share with you a video from a series that I've been working on that tries to express the slow  in between existence that my father has experienced. As he began to regain his ability to breathe  I started recording his thoughts  and so the voice that you hear in this video is his voice. you're paralyzed to play the part of a quadriplegic. I don't. In my mind  and in my dreams every night I Chagall man float over the city twirl and swirl with my toes kissing the floor. I know nothing about the statement of man without motion. Everything has motion. The heart pumps. The body heaves. The mouth moves. We never stagnate. Life triumphs up and down. Kitra Cahana  For most of us  our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious  but my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery of the human experience. Like an astronaut who sees a perspective that very few of us will ever get to share  he wonders and watches as he takes his first breaths and dreams about crawling back home. So begins life at     he says. A toddler has no attitude in its being  but a man insists on his world every day. Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has  but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives. I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely unscalable  but my father insists that there are no dead ends. Instead  he invites me into his space of co healing to give the very best of myself  and for him to give the very best of himself to me. Paralysis was an opening for him. It was an opportunity to emerge  to rekindle life force  to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation. Today  my father is no longer locked in. He moves his neck with ease  has had his feeding peg removed  breathes with his own lungs  speaks slowly with his own quiet voice  and works every day to gain more movement in his paralyzed body. But the work will never be finished. As he says   I'm living in a broken world  and there is holy work to do.  Thank you. Technology has brought us so much  the moon landing  the Internet  the ability to sequence the human genome. But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears  and about    years ago  the culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book called  Amusing Ourselves to Death   which lays this out really brilliantly. And here's what he said  comparing the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. He said  Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture. Orwell feared the truth would be concealed from us  and Huxley feared we would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. In a nutshell  it's a choice between Big Brother watching you and you watching Big Brother. But it doesn't have to be this way. We are not passive consumers of data and technology. We shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it  but to do that  we have to pay as much attention to how we think as how we code. We have to ask questions  and hard questions  to move past counting things to understanding them. We're constantly bombarded with stories about how much data there is in the world  but when it comes to big data and the challenges of interpreting it  size isn't everything. There's also the speed at which it moves  and the many varieties of data types  and here are just a few examples  images  text  video  audio. And what unites this disparate types of data is that they're created by people and they require context. Now  there's a group of data scientists out of the University of Illinois Chicago  and they're called the Health Media Collaboratory  and they've been working with the Centers for Disease Control to better understand how people talk about quitting smoking  how they talk about electronic cigarettes  and what they can do collectively to help them quit. The interesting thing is  if you want to understand how people talk about smoking  first you have to understand what they mean when they say  smoking.  And on Twitter  there are four main categories  number one  smoking cigarettes  number two  smoking marijuana  number three  smoking ribs  and number four  smoking hot women. So then you have to think about  well  how do people talk about electronic cigarettes  And there are so many different ways that people do this  and you can see from the slide it's a complex kind of a query. And what it reminds us is that language is created by people  and people are messy and we're complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this      in many  many languages  and then as soon as we figure it out  we change it up. So did these ads that the CDC put on  these television ads that featured a woman with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic and very disturbing  did they actually have an impact on whether people quit  And the Health Media Collaboratory respected the limits of their data  but they were able to conclude that those advertisements   and you may have seen them   that they had the effect of jolting people into a thought process that may have an impact on future behavior. And what I admire and  appreciate about this project  aside from the fact  including the fact that it's based on real human need  is that it's a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance. And so it's not just big data that causes challenges of interpretation  because let's face it  we human beings have a very rich history of taking any amount of data  no matter how small  and screwing it up. So many years ago  you may remember that former President Ronald Reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things. And it was a slip of the tongue  let's be fair. He actually meant to quote John Adams' defense of British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trials that facts are stubborn things. But I actually think there's a bit of accidental wisdom in what he said  because facts are stubborn things  but sometimes they're stupid  too. I want to tell you a personal story about why this matters a lot to me. I need to take a breath. My son Isaac  when he was two  was diagnosed with autism  and he was this happy  hilarious  loving  affectionate little guy  but the metrics on his developmental evaluations  which looked at things like  the number of words   at that point  none   communicative gestures and minimal eye contact  put his developmental level at that of a nine month old baby. And the diagnosis was factually correct  but it didn't tell the whole story. And about a year and a half later  when he was almost four  I found him in front of the computer one day running a Google image search on women  spelled  w i m e n.  And I did what any obsessed parent would do  which is immediately started  hitting the  back  button to see what else he'd been searching for. And they were  in order  men  school  bus and computer. And I was stunned  because we didn't know that he could spell  much less read  and so I asked him   Isaac  how did you do this   And he looked at me very seriously and said   Typed in the box.  He was teaching himself to communicate  but we were looking in the wrong place  and this is what happens when assessments and analytics overvalue one metric   in this case  verbal communication   and undervalue others  such as creative problem solving. Communication was hard for Isaac  and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know. And when you think about it  it makes a lot of sense  because forming a question is a really complex process  but he could get himself a lot of the way there by putting a word in a search box. And so this little moment had a really profound impact on me and our family because it helped us change our frame of reference for what was going on with him  and worry a little bit less and appreciate his resourcefulness more. Facts are stupid things. And they're vulnerable to misuse  willful or otherwise. I have a friend  Emily Willingham  who's a scientist  and she wrote a piece for Forbes not long ago entitled  The    Weirdest Things Ever Linked to Autism.  It's quite a list. The Internet  blamed for everything  right  And of course mothers  because. And actually  wait  there's more  there's a whole bunch in  the  mother  category here. And you can see it's a pretty  rich and interesting list. I'm a big fan of being pregnant near freeways  personally. The final one is interesting  because the term  refrigerator mother  was actually the original hypothesis for the cause of autism  and that meant somebody  who was cold and unloving. And at this point  you might be thinking   Okay  Susan  we get it  you can take data  you can  make it mean anything.  And this is true  it's absolutely true  but the challenge is that we have this opportunity to try to make meaning out of it ourselves  because frankly  data doesn't  create meaning. We do. So as businesspeople  as consumers  as patients  as citizens  we have a responsibility  I think  to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills. Why  Because at this point in our history  as we've heard many times over  we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed  and we have the potential to make bad decisions far more quickly  efficiently  and with far greater impact than we did in the past. Great  right  And so what we need to do instead is spend a little bit more time on things like the humanities and sociology  and the social sciences  rhetoric  philosophy  ethics  because they give us context that is so important for big data  and because they help us become better critical thinkers. Because after all  if I can spot a problem in an argument  it doesn't much matter whether it's expressed in words or in numbers. And this means teaching ourselves to find  those confirmation biases and false correlations and being able to spot a naked emotional appeal from    yards  because something that happens after something doesn't mean it happened  because of it  necessarily  and if you'll let me geek out on you for a second  the Romans called this   post hoc ergo propter hoc   after which therefore because of which. And it means questioning disciplines like demographics. Why  Because they're based on assumptions about who we all are based on our gender and our age and where we live as opposed to data on what  we actually think and do. And since we have this data  we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls and consumer opt in  and beyond that  we need to be clear about our hypotheses  the methodologies that we use  and our confidence in the result. As my high school algebra teacher used to say  show your math  because if I don't know what steps you took  I don't know what steps you didn't take  and if I don't know what questions you asked  I don't know what questions you didn't ask. And it means asking ourselves  really  the hardest question of all  Did the data really show us this  or does the result make us feel more successful and more comfortable  So the Health Media Collaboratory  at the end of their project  they were able to find that    percent of tweets about those very graphic and disturbing anti smoking ads expressed fear  but did they conclude that they actually made people stop smoking  No. It's science  not magic. So if we are to unlock the power of data  we don't have to go blindly into Orwell's vision of a totalitarian future  or Huxley's vision of a trivial one  or some horrible cocktail of both. What we have to do is treat critical thinking with respect and be inspired by examples like the Health Media Collaboratory  and as they say in the superhero movies  let's use our powers for good. Thank you. I experienced my first coup d' tat at the age of four. Because of the coup d' tat  my family had to leave my native home of Ghana and move to the Gambia. As luck would have it  six months after we arrived  they too had a military coup. I vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours to a safe house. For a week  we slept under our beds because we were worried that bullets might fly through the window. Then  at the age of eight  we moved to Botswana. This time  it was different. There were no coups. Everything worked. Great education. They had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had a fiber optic telephone system  long before it had reached Western countries. The only thing they didn't have is that they didn't have their own national television station  and so I remember watching TV from neighboring South Africa  and watching Nelson Mandela in jail being offered a chance to come out if he would give up the apartheid struggle. But he didn't. He refused to do that until he actually achieved his objective of freeing South Africa from apartheid. And I remember feeling how just one good leader could make such a big difference in Africa. Then at the age of     my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe. Initially  this too was amazing  growing economy  excellent infrastructure  and it seemed like it was a model for economic development in Africa. I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe and I went off to college. Six years later  I returned to the country. Everything was different. It had shattered into pieces. Millions of people had emigrated  the economy was in a shambles  and it seemed all of a sudden that    years of development had been wiped out. How could a country go so bad so fast  Most people would agree that it's all because of leadership. One man  President Robert Mugabe  is almost single handedly responsible for having destroyed this country. Now  all these experiences of living in different parts of Africa growing up did two things to me. The first is it made me fall in love with Africa. Everywhere I went  I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people  and at the time  I realized that I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to making this continent great. But I also realized that making Africa great would require addressing this issue of leadership. You see  all these countries I lived in  the coups d' tat and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia and in Zimbabwe  contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen in Botswana and in South  Africa of good leadership. It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall because of the quality of our leaders. Now  one might think  of course  leadership matters everywhere. But if there's one thing you take away from my talk today  it is this  In Africa  more than anywhere else in the world  the difference that just one good leader can make is much greater than anywhere  else  and here's why. It's because in Africa  we have weak institutions  like the judiciary  the constitution  civil society and so forth. So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in  When societies have strong institutions  the difference that one good leader can make is limited  but when you have weak institutions  then just one good leader can make or break that country. Let me make it a bit more concrete. You become the president of the United States. You think   Wow  I've arrived. I'm the most powerful man in the world.  So you decide  perhaps let me pass a law. All of a sudden  Congress taps you on the shoulder and says   No  no  no  no  no  you can't do that.  You say   Let me try this way.  The Senate comes and says   Uh uh  we don't think you can do that.  You say  perhaps   Let me print some money. I think the economy needs a stimulus.  The central bank governor will think you're crazy. You might get impeached for that. But if you become the president of Zimbabwe  and you say   You know  I really like this job. I think I'd like to stay in it forever.   Laughter  Well  you just can. You decide you want to print money. You call the central bank governor and you say   Please double the money supply.  He'll say   Okay  yes  sir  is there anything else I can do for you   This is the power that African leaders have  and this is why they make the most difference on the continent. The good news is that the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving. We've had three generations  of leaders  in my mind. Generation one are those who appeared in the '  s and '  s. These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania. The legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa. They freed us from colonialism  and let's give them credit for that. They were followed by generation two. These are people that brought nothing but havoc to Africa. Think warfare  corruption  human rights abuses. This is the stereotype of  the typical African leader that we typically think of  Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire  Sani Abacha from Nigeria. The good news is that most of these leaders have moved on  and they were replaced by generation three. These are people like the late Nelson Mandela and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today  like Paul Kagame and so forth. Now these leaders are by no means perfect  but the one thing they have done is that they have cleaned up much of the mess of generation two. They've stopped the fighting  and I call them the stabilizer generation. They're much more accountable to their people  they've improved macroeconomic policies  and we are seeing for the first time Africa's growing  and in  fact it's the second fastest growing economic region in the world. So these leaders are by no means perfect  but they are by and large the best leaders we've seen in the last    years. So where to from here  I believe that the next generation to come after this  generation four  has a unique opportunity to transform the continent. Specifically  they can do two things that previous generations have not done. The first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent. Why is prosperity so important  Because none of the previous generations have been able to tackle this issue of poverty. Africa today has the fastest growing population in the world  but also is the poorest. By       Africa will have a larger workforce than China  and by       it will have the largest workforce in the world. One billion people will need jobs in Africa  so if we don't grow our economies fast enough  we're sitting on a ticking time bomb  not just for Africa but for the entire world. Let me show you an example of one person who is living up to this legacy of creating prosperity  Laetitia. Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya who at the age of    had to drop out of school because her family couldn't  afford to pay fees for her. So she started her own business rearing rabbits  which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya that she's from. This business did so well that within a year  she was employing    women and was able to generate enough income that she was able to send herself to school  and through these women fund another    children to go to school. The profits that she generated  she used that to build a school  and today she educates     children in her community. And she's just turned   . Another example is Erick Rajaonary. Erick comes from the island of Madagascar. Now  Erick realized that agriculture would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of Madagascar  but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar. Madagascar has these very special bats that produce these droppings that are very high in nutrients. In       Erick quit his job  as a chartered accountant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat droppings. Today  Erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue  and he employs    people full time and another     people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most. Now  what I like about this story is that it shows that opportunities  to create prosperity can be found almost anywhere. Erick is known as the Batman. And who would have thought that you would have been able to build a multimillion dollar business employing so many people just from bat poo  The second thing that this generation needs to do is to create our institutions. They need to build these institutions such that we are never held to ransom again by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe. Now  all of this sounds great  but where are we going to get this generation four from  Do we just sit and hope that they emerge by chance  or that God gives them to us  No  I don't think so. It's too important an issue  for us to leave it to chance. I believe that we need to create African institutions  home grown  that will identify and develop these leaders in a systematic  practical way. We've been doing this for the last    years through the African Leadership Academy. Laetitia is one of our young leaders. Today  we have     of them  that are being groomed for the African continent  and over the next    years  we expect to create       of them. But one thing has been troubling me. We would get about       applications a year for     young leaders that we could take into this academy  and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed for this leadership training that we're offering. But we couldn't satisfy it. So today  I'm announcing for the first time in public an extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy. We're building    brand new universities in Africa that are going to cultivate this next generation of African leaders. Each campus will have        leaders at a time so we'll be educating and developing         leaders at any given time. Over the next    years  this institution will create three million transformative leaders for the continent. My hope is that half of them will become the entrepreneurs that we need  who will create these jobs that we need  and the other half will go into government and the nonprofit sector  and they will build the institutions that we need. But they won't just learn academics. They will also learn how to become leaders  and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs. So think of this as Africa's Ivy League  but instead of getting admitted because of your SAT scores or because of how much money you have or which family you come from  the main criteria for getting into this university will be what is the potential that you have for transforming Africa  But what we're doing is  just one group of institutions. We cannot transform Africa by ourselves. My hope is that many  many other home grown African institutions will blossom  and these institutions will all come together with a common vision of developing this next generation of African leaders  generation four  and they will teach them this common message  create jobs  build our institutions. Nelson Mandela once said   Every now and then  a generation is called upon to be great. You can be that great generation.  I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate the next generation of African leaders  then this generation four that is coming up will be the greatest generation that Africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen. Thank you. I suspect that every aid worker in Africa comes to a time in her career when she wants to take all  the money for her project   maybe it's a school or a training program   pack it in a suitcase  get on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country  and start throwing that money out the window. Because to a veteran aid worker  the idea of putting cold  hard cash into the hands of the poorest people on Earth doesn't sound crazy  it sounds really satisfying. I had that moment right about the    year mark  and luckily  that's also when I learned that this idea actually exists  and it might be just what the aid system needs. Economists call it an unconditional cash transfer  and it's exactly that  It's cash given with no strings attached. Governments in developing countries have been doing this for decades  and it's only now  with more evidence and new technology that it's possible to make this a model for delivering aid. It's a pretty simple idea  right  Well  why did I spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor  Honestly  I believed that I could do more good with money for the poor than the poor could do for themselves. I held two assumptions  One  that poor people are poor in part because they're uneducated and don't make good choices  two is that we then need people like me to figure out what they need and get it to them. It turns out  the evidence says otherwise. In recent years  researchers have been studying what happens when we give poor people cash. Dozens of studies show across the board that people use cash transfers to improve their own lives. Pregnant women in Uruguay buy better food and give birth to healthier babies. Sri Lankan men invest in their businesses. Researchers who studied our work in Kenya found that people invested in a range of assets  from livestock to equipment  to home improvements  and they saw increases in income from business and farming one year after the cash was sent. None of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people work less. In fact  they work more. Now  these are all material needs. In Vietnam  elderly recipients used their cash transfers to pay for coffins. As someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong  I find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs deeply humbling. I don't know if I would have chosen to give food or equipment or coffins  which begs the question  How good are we at allocating resources on behalf of the poor  Are we worth the cost  Again  we can look at empirical evidence on what happens when we give people stuff of our choosing. One very telling study looked at a program in India that gives livestock to the so called ultra poor  and they found that    percent of recipients had turned around and sold the livestock they had been given for cash. The real irony is  for every     dollars worth of assets this program gave someone  they spent another    dollars to do it. What if  instead  we use technology to put cash  whether from aid agencies or from any one of us directly into a poor person's hands. Today  three in four Kenyans use mobile money  which is basically a bank account that can run on any cell phone. A sender can pay a  .  percent fee and with the click of a button send money directly to a recipient's account with no intermediaries. Like the technologies that are disrupting industries in our own lives  payments technology in poor countries could disrupt aid. It's spreading so quickly that it's possible to imagine reaching billions of the world's poor this way. That's what we've started to do at GiveDirectly. We're the first organization dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor. We've sent cash to         people across rural Kenya and Uganda in one time payments of       dollars per family. So far  we've looked for the poorest people in the poorest villages  and in this part of the world  they're the ones living in homes made of mud and thatch  not cement and iron. So let's say that's your family. We show up at your door with an Android phone. We'll get your name  take your photo and a photo of your hut and grab the GPS coordinates. That night  we send all the data to the cloud  and each piece gets checked by an independent team using  for one example  satellite images. Then  we'll come back  we'll sell you a basic cell phone if you don't have one already  and a few weeks later  we send money to it. Something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we can now do efficiently and free of corruption. The more cash we give to the poor  and the more evidence we have that it works  the more we have to reconsider everything else we give. Today  the logic behind aid is too often  well  we do at least some good. When we're complacent with that as our bar  when we tell ourselves that giving aid is better than no aid at all  we tend to invest inefficiently  in our own ideas that strike us as innovative  on writing reports  on plane tickets and SUVs. What if the logic was  will we do better than cash given directly  Organizations would have to prove that they're doing more good for the poor than the poor can do for themselves. Of course  giving cash won't create public goods like eradicating disease or  building strong institutions  but it could set a higher bar for how we help individual families improve their lives. I believe in aid. I believe most aid is better than just throwing money out of a plane. I am also absolutely certain that a lot of aid today isn't better than giving directly to the poor. I hope that one day  it will be. Thank you. I have a confession to make. I am addicted to adventure  and as a young boy  I would rather look outside the window at the birds in the trees and the sky than looking at that two dimensional chalky blackboard where time stands still and even sometimes dies. My teachers thought there was something wrong with me because I wasn't paying attention in class. They didn't find anything  specifically wrong with me  other than being slightly  dyslexic because I'm a lefty. But they didn't test for curiosity. Curiosity  to me  is about our connection with the world  with the universe. It's about seeing what's  around that next coral head or what's around that next tree  and learning more not only about our environment but about ourselves. Now  my dream of dreams  I want to go explore the oceans of Mars  but until we can go there  I think the oceans still hold quite a few secrets. As a matter of fact  if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is and dissect it into a living space  the ocean represents over  .  billion cubic kilometers of volume  within which we've explored less than five percent. And I look at this  and I go  well  there are tools to go  deeper  longer and further  submarines  ROVs  even Scuba diving. But if we're going to explore the final frontier on this planet  we need to live there. We need to build a log cabin  if you will  at the bottom of the sea. And so there was a great curiosity in my soul when I went to go visit a TED  Prize winner  by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle. Maybe you've heard of her. Two years ago  she was staked out at the last undersea marine laboratory to try and save it  to try and petition for us not to scrap it and bring it back on land. We've only had about a dozen or so scientific labs at the bottom of the sea. There's only one left in the world  it's nine miles offshore and    feet down. It's called Aquarius. Aquarius  in some fashion  is a dinosaur  an ancient robot chained to the bottom  this Leviathan. In other ways  it's a legacy. And so with that visit  I realized  that my time is short if I wanted to experience what it was like to become an aquanaut. When we swam towards this after many moons of torture and two years of preparation  this habitat waiting to invite us was like a new home. And the point of going down to and living at this habitat was not to stay inside. It wasn't about living at something the size of a school bus. It was about giving us the luxury of time outside to wander  to explore  to understand more about this oceanic final frontier. We had megafauna come and visit us. This spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans. But why this is so important  why this picture is up  is because this particular animal brought his friends around  and instead of being the pelagic animals that they were  they started getting curious about us  these new strangers that were moving into the neighborhood  doing things with plankton. We were studying all sorts of animals and critters  and they got closer and closer to us  and because of the luxury of time  these animals  these residents of the coral reef  were starting to get used to us  and these pelagics that normal travel through stopped. This particular animal actually circled for    full days during our mission. So mission    wasn't so much about breaking records. It was about that human ocean connection. Because of the luxury of time  we were able to study animals such as sharks and grouper in aggregations that we've never seen before. It's like seeing dogs and  cats behaving well together. Even being able to commune with animals that are much larger than us  such as this endangered goliath grouper who only still resides in the Florida Keys. Of course  just like any neighbor  after a while  if they get tired  the goliath grouper barks at us  and this bark is so powerful that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all within a split second. For us  it's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone. Now  this wasn't just about adventure. There was actually a serious note to it. We did a lot of science  and again  because of the luxury of time  we were able to do over three years of science in    days. In this particular case  we were using a PAM  or  let me just see if I can get this straight  a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer. And our scientists from FIU  MIT  and from Northeastern were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do when we're not around. The Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer  or PAM  gauges the fluorescence of corals as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change related issues. We used all sorts of other cutting edge tools  such as this sonde  or what I like to call the sponge proctologist  whereby the sonde itself tests for metabolism rates in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge  or the redwoods of the  ocean . And this gives us a much better gauge of what's happening underwater with regard to climate change related issues  and how the dynamics of that affect us here on land. And finally  we looked at predator prey behavior. And predator prey behavior is an interesting thing  because as we take away some of the predators on these coral reefs around the world  the prey  or the forage fish  act very differently. What we realized is not only do they stop taking care of the reef  darting in  grabbing a little bit of algae and going back into their homes  they start spreading out and disappearing from those particular coral reefs. Well  within that    days  we were able to generate over    scientific papers on each one of these topics. But the point of adventure is not only to learn  it's to be able to share that  knowledge with the world  and with that  thanks to a  couple of engineers at MIT  we were able to use a prototype camera called the Edgertronic to capture slow motion video  up to        frames per second in a little box that's worth       dollars. It's available to every one of us. And that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye. Let me show you a quick video of what this camera does. You can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats. It gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for    days and never normally would have paid attention to  such as hermit crabs. Now  using a cutting edge piece of technology that's not really meant for the oceans is not always easy. We sometimes had to put the camera upside down  cordon it back to the lab  and actually man the trigger from the lab itself. But what this gives us is the foresight to look at and analyze in scientific and engineering terms some of the most amazing behavior that the human eye just can't pick up  such as this manta shrimp trying to catch its prey  within about .  seconds. That punch is as strong as a .   caliber bullet  and if you ever try to catch a bullet in mid flight with your eye  impossible. But now we can see things such as these Christmas tree worms pulling in and fanning out in a way that the eye just can't capture  or in this case  a fish throwing up grains of sand. This is an actual sailfin goby  and if you look at it in real time  it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion because it's so quick. One of the most precious gifts that we had underwater is that we had WiFi  and for    days straight we were able to connect with the world in real time  from the bottom of the sea and share all of these experiences. Quite literally right there I am Skyping in the classroom with one of the six continents and some of the         students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences. As a matter of fact  I'm showing a picture that I took with my smartphone from underwater of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom. We had never seen that before. And I dream of the day that we have underwater cities  and maybe  just maybe  if we push the boundaries of adventure and knowledge  and we share that knowledge with others out there  we can solve all sorts of problems. My grandfather used to say   People protect what they love.  My father   How can people protect what they don't understand   And I've thought about this my whole life. Nothing is impossible. We need to dream  we need to be creative  and we all need to have an adventure in order to create miracles in the darkest of times. And whether it's about climate change or eradicating poverty or giving back to future generations what we've taken for granted  it's about adventure. And who knows  maybe there will be underwater cities  and maybe some of you will become the future aquanauts. Thank you very much. George and Charlotte Blonsky  who were a married couple living in the Bronx in New York City  invented something. They got a patent in      for what they call   a device to assist women in giving birth.  This device consists of a large  round table and some machinery. When the woman is ready to deliver her child  she lies on her back  she is strapped down to the table  and the table is rotated at high speed. The child comes flying out through centrifugal force. If you look at their patent carefully  especially if you have any engineering background or talent  you may decide that you see one or two points where the design is  not perfectly adequate.  Laughter  Doctor Ivan Schwab in California is one of the people   one of the main people  who helped answer the question   Why don't woodpeckers get headaches   And it turns out the answer to that is because their brains are packaged inside their skulls in a way different from the way our brains  we being human beings  true  have our brains packaged. They  the woodpeckers  typically will peck  they will bang their head on a piece of wood thousands  of times every day. Every day  And as far as anyone knows  that doesn't bother them in the slightest. How does this happen  Their brain does not slosh around like ours does. Their brain is packed in very tightly  at least for blows coming  right from the front. Not too many people paid attention to this research until the last few years when  in this country especially  people are becoming curious about what happens to the brains of football players who bang their heads repeatedly. And the woodpecker maybe relates to that. There was a paper published in the medical journal The Lancet in England a few years ago called   A man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for   years.  Dr. Caroline Mills and her team received this patient and didn't  really know what to do about it. The man had cut his finger  he worked processing chickens  and then he started to smell really  really bad. So bad that when  he got in a room with the doctors and the nurses  they couldn't stand being  in the room with him. It was intolerable. They tried every drug  every other treatment they could think of. After a year  he still  smelled putrid. After two years  still smelled putrid. Three years  four years  still smelled putrid. After five years  it went away on its own. It's a mystery. In New Zealand  Dr. Lianne Parkin and her team tested an old  tradition in her city. They live in a city that has huge hills  San Francisco grade hills. And in the winter there  it gets very cold and very icy. There are lots of injuries. The tradition that they tested  they tested by asking people who were on their way to  work in the morning  to stop and try something out. Try one of two conditions. The tradition is that in the winter  in that city  you wear your socks on the outside of your boots. And what they discovered by experiment  and it was quite graphic when they saw it  was that it's true. That if you wear your socks on the  outside rather than the inside  you're much more likely  to survive and not slip and fall. Now  I hope you will agree with me that these things I've just described to you  each of them  deserves some kind of prize.  Laughter  And that's what they got  each of them got an Ig Nobel prize. In       I  together with bunch of other people  started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony. Every year we give out    prizes. The prizes are based on just  one criteria. It's very simple. It's that you've done something that  makes people laugh and then think. What you've done makes  people laugh and then think. Whatever it is  there's something about it that when people encounter it at first  their only possible reaction is to laugh. And then a week later  it's still rattling around in their heads and all they want to do  is tell their friends about it. That's the quality we look for. Every year  we get in the neighborhood of       new nominations  for the Ig Nobel prize. Of those  consistently between    percent and    percent of those nominations are people who nominate themselves. Those self nominees almost never win. It's very difficult  numerically   to win a prize if you want to. Even if you don't want to  it's very difficult numerically. You should know that when  we choose somebody to win an Ig Nobel prize  We get in touch with that person  very quietly. We offer them the chance to decline this great honor if they want to. Happily for us  almost everyone  who's offered a prize decides to accept. What do you get if you win an Ig Nobel prize  Well  you get several things. You get an Ig Nobel prize. The design is different every year. These are always handmade from extremely cheap materials. You're looking at a picture of the prize we gave last year      . Most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash  some money. We don't have any money  so we can't give them. In fact  the winners have to pay their own way to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony  which most of them do. Last year  though  we did manage to scrape up some money. Last year  each of the    Ig Nobel prize winners received from us    trillion dollars. A     trillion bill from Zimbabwe.  Laughter  You may remember that  Zimbabwe had a little adventure for a few years there of inflation. They ended up printing bills that were in denominations as large as     trillion dollars. The man responsible  who runs the national bank there  by the way  won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics. The other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony  which happens at Harvard University. And when you get there  you come to Harvard's biggest  meeting place and classroom. It fits       people  it's jammed to the gills  and up on the stage  waiting to shake your hand  waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize  are a bunch of Nobel prize winners. That's the heart of the ceremony. The winners are kept secret until that moment  even the Nobel laureates  who will shake their hand don't know who they are until they're announced. I am going to tell you  about just a very few of the other medical related prizes we've given. Keep in mind  we've given     prizes. There are lots of these people who walk among you. Maybe you have one. A paper was published about    years ago called  Injuries due to Falling Coconuts.  It was written by Dr. Peter Barss  who is Canadian. Dr. Barss came to the ceremony and explained that as a young doctor  he wanted to see the world. So he went to Papua New Guinea. When he got there  he went to work in a hospital  and he was curious what kinds of things happen to people that bring them to the hospital. He looked through the  records  and he discovered that a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling coconuts. One typical thing that happens is people will come from the highlands  where there are not many coconut trees  down to visit their relatives on the coast  where there are lots. And they'll think that a coconut tree is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down. A coconut tree that is    feet tall  and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time. A team of doctors in Europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies. You're all familiar with colonoscopies  one way or another. Or in some cases  one way and another. They  in these papers  explained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies  how to minimize the chance that when you perform a colonoscopy  your patient will explode.  Laughter  Dr. Emmanuel Ben Soussan one of the authors  flew in from Paris to the ceremony  where he explained the history of this  that in the     s  when colonoscopies were becoming a common technique for the first time  people were figuring out how to do it well. And there were some difficulties at first. The basic problem  I'm sure you're familiar with  that you're looking inside a  long  narrow  dark place. And so  you want to have a larger space. You add some gas to inflate it so you have room to look around. Now  that's added to the  gas  the methane gas  that's already inside. The gas that they used at first  in many cases  was oxygen. So they added oxygen to methane gas. And then they wanted to be able to see  they needed light  so they'd put in a light source  which in the     s was very hot. So you had methane gas  which is flammable  oxygen and heat. They stopped using oxygen pretty quickly.  Laughter  Now it's rare that patients will explode  but it does still happen. The final thing that I want  to tell you about is a prize we gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar. Dr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere that in an emergency can be quickly separated into a pair of protective face masks. One to save your life  one to save the life of some  lucky bystander.  Laughter  Why would someone do this  you might wonder. Dr. Bodnar came to the ceremony and she explained that  she grew up in Ukraine. She was one of the doctors who treated victims of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown. And they later discovered that a lot of the worst medical problems came from the particles people breathed in. So she was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere when the unexpected happens. Years later  she moved to America. She had a baby  One day she looked  and on the floor  her infant son had picked up her bra  and had her bra on his face. And that's where the idea came from. She came to the Ig Nobel ceremony with the first prototype of the bra and she demonstrated    Paul Krugman  Nobel laureate         in economics     Wolfgang Ketterle  Nobel  laureate        in physics   I myself own an emergency bra.  Laughter  It's my favorite bra  but I would be happy to  share it with any of you  should the need arise. Thank you. Let me tell you a story about a little girl named Naghma. Naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters. Every morning  her father would wake up in the hopes he'd be picked for construction work  and on a good month he would earn    dollars. The winter was very harsh  and unfortunately  Naghma's brother died and her mother became very ill. In desperation  her father went to a neighbor to borrow       dollars. After several months of waiting  the neighbor became very impatient  and he demanded that he be paid back. Unfortunately  Naghma's father didn't have the money  and so the two men agreed to a jirga. So simply put  a jirga is a form of mediation that's used in Afghanistan's  informal justice system. It's usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders  and jirgas are often used in rural countries like Afghanistan  where there's deep seated resentment against the formal system. At the jirga  the men sat together and they decided that the  best way to satisfy the debt would be if Naghma married the neighbor's    year old son. She was six. Now  stories like Naghma's unfortunately are all too common  and from the comforts of our home  we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women's rights. And if you watched Afghanistan on the news  you may have this view that it's a failed state. However  Afghanistan does have a legal system  and while jirgas are built on long standing tribal customs  even in jirgas  laws are supposed to be followed  and it goes without saying that giving a child to satisfy a debt is not only grossly immoral  it's illegal. In       I went to Afghanistan for a justice funded program  and I went there originally  on this nine month program to train Afghan lawyers. In that nine months  I went around the country and I talked to hundreds of people that were locked up  and I talked to many businesses that were also operating in Afghanistan. And within these conversations  I started hearing the connections between the businesses and the people  and how laws that were meant to protect them were being underused  while gross and illegal punitive measures were overused. And so this put me on a quest for justness  and what justness means to me is using laws for their intended purpose  which is to protect. The role of laws is to protect. So as a result  I decided to  open up a private practice  and I became the first foreigner to litigate in Afghan courts. Throughout this time  I also studied many laws  I talked to many people  I read up on many cases  and I found that the lack of justness is not just a problem in Afghanistan  but it's a global problem. And while I originally shied away from representing human rights cases because I was really concerned about how it would affect me both professionally and personally  I decided that the need for justness was so great that I couldn't continue to ignore it. And so I started representing people like Naghma pro bono also. Now  since I've been in Afghanistan and since I've been an attorney for over    years  I've represented from CEOs  of Fortune     companies to ambassadors to little girls like Naghma  and with much success. And the reason for my success is very simple  I work the system from the inside out and use the laws in the ways that they're intended to be used. I find that achieving justness in places like Afghanistan is difficult  and there's three reasons. The first reason is that simply put  people are very uneducated as to what their legal rights were  and I find that this is a global problem. The second issue is that even with laws on the books  it's often superseded or ignored by tribal customs  like in the first jirga that sold Naghma off. And the third problem with achieving justness is that even with good  existing laws on the books  there aren't people or lawyers  that are willing to fight for those laws. And that's what I do  I use existing laws  often unused laws  and I work those to the benefits of my clients. We all need to create a global culture of human rights and be investors in a global  human rights economy  and by working in this mindset  we can significantly improve justice globally. Now let's get back to Naghma. Several people heard about this story  and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the        debt. And it's not just that simple  you can't just throw money at this problem and think that it's going to disappear. That's not how it works in Afghanistan. So I told them I'd get involved  but in order to get involved   what needed to happen is a second jirga needed to be called  a jirga of appeals. And so in order for that to happen  we needed to get the village elders together  we needed to get the tribal leaders together  the religious leaders. Naghma's father needed to agree  the neighbor needed to agree  and also his son needed to agree. And I thought  if I'm going to  get involved in this thing  then they also need to agree  that I preside over it. So  after hours of talking and tracking them down  and about    cups of tea  they finally agreed that we could sit down for a second jirga  and we did. And what was different about the second jirga is this time  we put the law at the center of it  and it was very important for me that they all understood that Naghma had a right to be protected. And at the end of this jirga  it was ordered by the judge that the first decision was erased  and that the        debt was satisfied  and we all signed a written order where all the men acknowledged that what they did was illegal  and if they did it again  that  they would go to prison. Most   Thanks. And most importantly  the engagement was terminated and Naghma was free. Protecting Naghma and her right to be free protects us. Now  with my job  there's above average amount of risks that are involved. I've been temporarily detained. I've been accused of running a brothel  accused of being a spy. I've had a grenade thrown at my office. It didn't go off  though. But I find that with my job  that the rewards far outweigh the risks  and as many risks as I take  my clients take far greater risks  because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard  or worse  if they're penalized for having me as their lawyer. With every case that I take  I realize that as much as I'm standing behind my clients  that they're also standing behind me  and that's what keeps me going. Law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us. Journalists are very vital in making sure that that information is given to the public. Too often  we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given. This picture is a picture of the British press corps in Afghanistan. It was taken a couple of years ago by my friend David Gill. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists  since       there have been  thousands of journalists who have been threatened  injured  killed  detained. Too often  when we get this information  we forget who it affects or how that information is given to us. What many journalists do   both foreign and domestic  is very remarkable  especially in places like Afghanistan  and it's important that we never forget that  because what they're protecting is not only our right to receive that information but also the freedom of the press  which is vital to a democratic society. Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan. He works for The New York Times  and unfortunately  a few months ago he wrote an article that displeased people in the government. As a result  he was temporarily detained and he was illegally exiled out of the country. I represent Matt  and after dealing with the government  I was able to get legal acknowledgment that in fact he was illegally exiled  and that freedom of the press does exist in Afghanistan  and there's consequences if that's not followed. And I'm happy to say that as of a few days ago  the Afghan government formally invited him back into the country and they reversed their exile order of him. If you censor one journalist   then it intimidates others  and soon nations are silenced. It's important that we protect our journalists and freedom of the press  because that makes governments more accountable to us and more transparent. Protecting journalists and our right to receive information protects us. Our world is changing. We live in a different world now  and what were once individual problems are really now global problems for all of us. Two weeks ago  Afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of power and elected president Ashraf Ghani  which is huge  and I'm very optimistic about him  and I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan the changes that it needs  especially within the legal sector. We live in a different world. We live in a world where my  eight year old daughter only knows a black president. There's a great possibility that our next president will be a woman  and as she gets older  she may question  can a white guy be president  Our world is changing  and  we need to change with it  and what were once individual problems are problems for all of us. According to UNICEF  there are currently over     million boys and girls who are married under the age of   . Two hundred and eighty million. Child marriages prolong the vicious cycle of poverty  poor health  lack of education. At the age of     Sahar was married. She was forced into this marriage and sold by her brother. When she went to her in laws' house  they forced her into prostitution. Because she refused  she was tortured. She was severely beaten with metal rods. They burned her body. They tied her up in a basement and starved her. They used pliers to take out her fingernails. At one point  she managed to escape from this torture chamber to a neighbor's house  and when she went there  instead of protecting her  they dragged her back to her husband's house  and she was tortured even worse. When I met first Sahar  thankfully  Women for Afghan Women gave her a safe haven to go to. As a lawyer  I try to be very strong for all my clients  because that's very important to me  but seeing her  how broken and very weak as she was  was very difficult. It took weeks for us to really get to what happened to her when she was in that house  but finally she started opening up to me  and when she opened up  what I heard was she didn't know what her rights were  but she did know she had  a certain level of protection by her government that failed her  and so we were able to talk about what her legal options were. And so we decided to take this case to the Supreme Court. Now  this is extremely significant  because this is the first time that a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan was being represented by a lawyer  a law that's been on the  books for years and years  but until Sahar  had never been used. In addition to this  we also decided to sue for civil damages  again using a law that's never been used  but we used it for her case. So there we were at the Supreme Court arguing in front of    Afghan justices  me as an American female lawyer  and Sahar  a young woman who when I met her couldn't  speak above a whisper. She stood up  she found her voice  and my girl told them that she wanted justice  and she got it. At the end of it all  the court unanimously agreed that her in laws should be arrested for what they did to her  her fucking brother should also be arrested for selling her   and they agreed that she did have a right to civil compensation. What Sahar has shown us is that we can attack existing bad practices by using the laws in the ways that they're intended to be used  and by protecting Sahar  we are protecting ourselves. After having worked in Afghanistan for over six years now  a lot of my family and friends think that what I do looks like this. But in all actuality  what I do looks like this. Now  we can all do something. I'm not saying we should all buy a plane ticket and go to Afghanistan  but we can all be contributors to a global human rights economy. We can create a culture of transparency and accountability to the laws  and make governments more accountable to us  as we are to them. A few months ago  a South African lawyer visited me in my office and he said   I wanted to meet you. I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like.  The laws are ours  and no matter what your ethnicity  nationality  gender  race  they belong to us  and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity. Businesses also need to get with the program. A corporate investment in human rights is a capital gain on your businesses  and whether you're a business  an NGO  or a private citizen  rule  of law benefits all of us. And by working together with a concerted mindset  through the people  public and private sector  we can create a global human rights economy and all become global investors in human rights. And by doing this  we can achieve justness together. Thank you. I came here to show you the Fotokite. It's a tethered  flying camera. But before I do that  I want to tell you a bit about where it came from  what motivated it. So I was born in Russia  and three years ago  in       there were the Russian federal elections. There were massive irregularities reported  and people came out to protest  which was very unlikely for Russia. And no one really knew how significant these protests were  because  for whatever reason  the world media largely ignored it. Now  there was a group of photographers who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby   usually photographing things like the Sphinx  the Pyramids   who happened to be right around the corner  and they flew a camera and they took some snapshots  some panoramas of this demonstration. Just completely independent entity  completely random occurrence  and the image  when I saw it  it really struck me. Here's one of the panoramas. So in a single image  you can really see the scale of this event   just the number of people  the colors  the banners. You just can't consider this insignificant. All in a single image  which was really cool to me. And I think  in the future  journalism and many other professions  there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there  but I think  you wait a few months  a few years  and for many professions  it's really going to be a requirement. And it make sense. It's  such a unique perspective. Nothing really communicates  this scale  for example  in context  in a way that this does. But there are a few hurdles   and they are quite basic and quite fundamental. One is piloting. So for this image  they flew a camera  a five kilogram device with an SLR under it. It's quite heavy  lots of  spinning  sharp things. It's a bit uncomfortable to fly  probably also for the operator. In fact  you can see that on the  back of the pilot's shirt  it says   No questions until landing  in Russian and in English  because people are curious  and they'll go tap you  and then you lose your focus and things happen. And these guys are great. They're professionals  they're really careful in what they do. So in the protests  maybe you noticed  they flew over the river so it was quite safe. But this doesn't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions  so we really have to make piloting easier. The other problem is regulations  or rather  the lack of good regulation. For many good reasons  it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws to regulate flying cameras. So we already have cameras. Everyone here  I'm sure  has a smartphone with a camera  right  There are more and more of them. You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked. You hear about  actually  a drone pilot  a hobbyist  was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach. Here's some personal input I didn't expect. Just yesterday  I was attacked by a guy who claimed that I was filming him. I was checking my email right here   easy way to get input for your talk. But I think there are better solutions. I think we have to defuse the situation. We have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety  accountability issues but still give us that perspective. And this is one potential solution. So this is the Fotokite. Well  let me see  it's a quadrocopter  but what's kind of special  about it is there's a leash. It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient. And the neat thing about it is  to fly it  there's no joysticks  nothing like this. You just turn it on and you point in the direction that you want to fly. You give it a little twist. That's kind of the way you communicate. And there it goes. So the interaction is super simple. It's like a personal flying pet. It just always maintains a certain angle to you  and if I move around with it  it'll actually follow me naturally. And of course  we can build on top of this. So this leash has some additional electronics. You can turn it on. And now  it's like telling your dog to fly lower  if you have such a dog. So  I can press a button and manipulate it rather easily. So I just shifted its position. And it's really safe. I don't know about you guys in the front row   you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection. Live demos are hard  right  Things go wrong all the time. But no matter what  this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you. What's more  it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device. You don't have to look for someone controlling it. Now  I can tell you that it's easy a lot  but I think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one and launch it. And if I can do this on stage live  then I can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to  operate one of these devices. So now we have two eyes in the sky.  Applause  And now the trick is getting them back. So my question now to you is  well  it's a nice solution  it's very accessible  it's safe. What would you use it for  What would you use such a camera for in your life  Thank you. Humanity takes center stage at TED  but I would like to add  a voice for the animals  whose bodies and minds  and spirits shaped us. Some years ago  it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island not far from Vancouver. His name is Jimmy Smith  and he shared a story with me that is told among his people  who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw. Once upon a time  he told me  all animals on Earth were one. Even though they look different on the outside  inside  they're all the same  and from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity. When they arrived  they would all take off their skins. Raven shed his feathers  bear his fur  and salmon her scales  and then  they would dance. But one day  a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understand. Embarrassed  the animals fled  and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way. The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities  all animals are one  has been a powerful inspiration to me. I like to get past the fur  the feathers and the scales. I want to get under the skin. No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog  my goal is to connect us with them  eye to eye. You may wonder  do I ever photograph people  Sure. People are always present in my photos  no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions. You just have to learn how  to look past their disguise. As a photographer  I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing. When I use my camera  I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are. As animals blessed with the power of rational thought  we can marvel at the intricacies of life. As citizens of a planet in trouble  it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life. But as humans with hearts  we can all rejoice in the unity of life  and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave. Let's find a way to join the dance. Thank you. I just met you on a bus  and we would really like  to get to know each other  but I've got to get off at the next stop  so you're going to tell me  three things about yourself that just define you as a person  three things about yourself that will help me understand who you are  three things that just  get to your very essence. And what I'm wondering is  of those three things  is any one of them surviving some kind of trauma  Cancer survivor  rape survivor  Holocaust survivor  incest survivor. Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves by our wounds  And where I have seen this survivor identity have the most consequences is in the cancer community. And I've been around this  community for a long time  because I've been a hospice  and a hospital chaplain for almost    years. And in       I was working at a big cancer center when I received the news that my mother had breast cancer. And then five days later  I received the news that I had breast cancer. My mother and I can be competitive   but I was really not trying to compete with her on this one. And in fact  I thought  well  if you have to have cancer  it's pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it. But this is what I heard from  a lot of outraged people. What  You're the chaplain. You should be immune. Like  maybe I should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket  because I'm on the force. So I did get my treatment at the cancer center where I worked  which was amazingly convenient  and I had chemotherapy and a mastectomy  and a saline implant put in  and so before I say another word  let me just say right now  this is the fake one.  Laughter  I have found that I need to get that out of the way  because I'll see somebody go  Oh  I know it's this one.  And then I'll move or I'll  gesture and they'll go   No  it's that one.  So now you know. I learned a lot being a patient  and one of the surprising things was that only a small part of the cancer experience is about medicine. Most of it is about feelings and faith and losing and finding your identity and discovering strength and flexibility you never even knew you had. It's about realizing that the most important things in life are not things at all  but relationships  and it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty and learning that the way to get out of almost anything is to say   I have cancer.  So the other thing I learned was that I don't have to take on  cancer survivor  as my identity  but  boy  are there powerful forces pushing me to do just that. Now  don't  please  misunderstand me. Cancer organizations and the drive for early screening and cancer awareness and cancer research have normalized cancer  and this is a wonderful thing. We can now talk about cancer without whispering. We can talk about cancer and we can support one another. But sometimes  it feels like people go a little overboard and they start telling us how we're going to feel. So about a week after my surgery  we had a houseguest. That was probably our first mistake. And keep in mind that at this point in my life I had been a chaplain for over    years  and issues like dying and death and the meaning of life  these are all things I'd been  yakking about forever. So at dinner that night  our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head  and say   You know  Deb  now you're really going to learn what's important. Yes  you are going to make some big changes in your life  and now you're going to start thinking about your death. Yep  this cancer is your wakeup call.  Now  these are golden words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience  but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel  it's instant crap. The only reason I did not kill him with my bare hands was because I could not lift my right arm. But I did say a really bad word to him  followed by a regular word  that   made my husband say   She's on narcotics.  And then after my treatment  it just felt like everyone was telling me what my experience was going to mean.  Oh  this means you're going to be doing the walk.   Oh  this means you're coming to the luncheon.   This means you're going to be wearing the pink ribbon and the pink t shirt and the headband and the earrings and the bracelet and the panties.  Panties. No  seriously  google it. How is that raising awareness  Only my husband should be seeing my panties. He's pretty aware of cancer already. It was at that point where I felt like  oh my God  this is just taking over my life. And that's when I told myself   claim your experience. Don't let it claim you. We all know that the way to cope with trauma  with loss  with any life changing experience  is to find meaning. But here's the thing  No one can tell us what our experience means. We have to decide what it means. And it doesn't have to be some gigantic  extroverted meaning. We don't all have to start a foundation or an organization or write a book or make a documentary. Meaning can be quiet and introverted. Maybe we make one small decision about our lives that can bring about big change. Many years ago  I had a patient  just a wonderful young man who was loved by the staff  and so it was something of a shock to us to realize that he had no friends. He lived by himself  he would come in for chemotherapy by himself  he would receive his treatment  and then he'd walk home alone. And I even asked him. I said   Hey  how come you never bring a friend with you   And he said   I don't really have any friends.  But he had tons of friends on the infusion floor. We all loved him  and people were going in and out of his room all the time. So at his last chemo  we sang him the song and we put the crown on his  head and we blew the bubbles  and then I asked him  I said   So what are you going to do now   And he answered   Make friends.  And he did. He started volunteering  and he made friends there  and he began going to a church and he made friends there  and at Christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment  and the place was filled with his friends. Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you. He decided that the meaning of his experience was to know the joy of friendship  and then learn to make friends. So what about you  How are you going to find meaning in your crappy experience  It could be a recent one  or it could be one that you've been carrying around for a really long time. It's never too late to change what it means  because meaning is dynamic. What it means today may not be what it means a year from now  or    years from now. It's never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor. Hear how static that word sounds  Survivor. No movement  no growth. Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you  because if you do  I believe you will become trapped  you will not grow  you will not evolve. But of course  sometimes it's not outside pressures that cause us to take on that identity of survivor. Sometimes we just like the perks. Sometimes there's a payoff. But then we get stuck. Now  one of the first things I learned as a chaplain intern was the three C's of the chaplain's job  Comfort  clarify and  when necessary  confront or challenge. Now  we all pretty much love the comforting and the clarifying. The confronting  not so much. One of the other things that I loved about being a chaplain was seeing patients a year  or even several years after their treatment  because it was just really cool to see  how they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them. So I was thrilled one day to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic from a patient who I had seen the year before  and she was there with her two adult daughters  who I also knew  for her one year follow up exam. So I got down to the lobby  and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was NED  No Evidence of Disease. Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead. So they were ecstatic  we sat down to visit  and it was so weird  because within two minutes  she  started retelling me the story of her diagnosis and her  surgery and her chemo  even though  as her chaplain   I saw her every week  and so I knew this story. And she was using words like suffering  agony  struggle. And she ended her story with   I felt crucified.  And at that point  her two  daughters got up and said   We're going to go get coffee.  And they left. Tell me three things about yourself before the next stop. People were leaving the bus before she even got to number two or number three. So I handed her a tissue  and I gave her a hug  and then  because I really cared for this woman  I said   Get down off your cross.  And she said   What   And I repeated   Get down off your cross.  And to her credit  she could  talk about her reasons for embracing and then clinging to this identity. It got her a lot of attention. People were taking care of her for a change. But now  it was having the opposite effect. It was pushing people away. People kept leaving to get coffee. She felt crucified by her experience  but she didn't want to let that crucified self die. Now  perhaps you are thinking I was a little harsh with her  so I must tell you that I was speaking out of my own experience. Many  many years before  I had been fired from a job that I loved  and I would not stop talking about my innocence and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt  until finally  just like this woman  people were walking away from me  until I finally realized I wasn't just processing my feelings  I was feeding them. I didn't want to let that crucified self die. But we all know that with any resurrection story  you have to die first. The Christian story  Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb before he was resurrected. And I believe that for us  being in the tomb means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds and allowing ourselves to be healed. We have to let that crucified self die so that a new self  a truer self  is born. We have to let that old story go so that a new story  a truer story  can be told. Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you. What if there were no survivors  meaning  what if people decided to just claim their trauma as an experience instead of taking it on as an identity  Maybe it would be the end of being trapped in our wounds and the beginning of amazing self exploration and discovery and growth. Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves by who we have become and who we are becoming. So perhaps survivor was not one of the three things that you would tell me. No matter. I just want you all to know that I am really glad that we are on this bus together  and this is my stop. So this is Anna Hazare  and Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting edge digital activist in the world today. And you wouldn't know it by looking at him. Hazare is a    year old Indian  anticorruption and social justice activist. And in       he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in India  a topic that Indian elites love to ignore. So as part of this campaign  he was using all of the traditional tactics that a good Gandhian organizer would use. So he was on a hunger strike  and Hazare realized through his hunger that actually maybe this time  in the   st century  a hunger strike wouldn't be enough. So he started playing around  with mobile activism. So the first thing he did  is he said to people   Okay  why don't you send me a text message if you support my campaign against corruption   So he does this  he  gives people a short code  and about        people do it. Okay  that's pretty respectable. But then he decides   Let me tweak my tactics a little bit.  He says   Why don't you leave me a missed call   Now  for those of you who have lived in the global South  you'll know that missed calls are a really critical part of global mobile culture. I see people nodding. People leave missed calls all the time  If you're running late for a meeting and you just want to let them know that you're on the way  you leave them a missed call. If you're dating someone and  you just want to say  I miss you  you leave them a missed call. So a note for a dating tip here  in some cultures  if you want to please your lover  you call them and hang up.  Laughter  So why do people leave missed calls  Well  the reason of course is that they're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts. So when Hazare asked people  to leave him a missed call  let's have a little guess how  many people actually did this  Thirty five million. So this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history. It's remarkable. And this reflects the extraordinary strength  of the emerging Indian middle class and the power that their mobile phones bring. But he used that  Hazare ended up with this massive  CSV file of mobile phone numbers  and he used that to deploy real people power on the ground to get hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets in Delhi to make a national point of  everyday corruption in India. It's a really striking story. So this is me when I was    years old. I hope you see the resemblance. And I was also an activist  and I have been an activist all my life. I had this really funny childhood where I traipsed around the world meeting world leaders and  Noble prize winners  talking about Third World debt  as it was then called  and demilitarization. I was a very  very serious child.  Laughter  And back then  in the early '  s  I had a very cutting edge tech tool of my own  the fax. And the fax was the  tool of my activism. And at that time  it was the best way to get a message to a lot of people all at once. I'll give you one example of a fax campaign that I ran. It was the eve of the Gulf War and I organized a global campaign  to flood the hotel  the Intercontinental in Geneva  where James Baker and Tariq Aziz were meeting on the eve of the war  and I thought if I could  flood them with faxes  we'll stop the war. Well  unsurprisingly  that campaign was wholly unsuccessful. There are lots of reasons for that  but there's no doubt that  one sputtering fax machine in Geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint in terms of the ability to  get a message to lots of people. And so  I went on to  discover some better tools. I cofounded Avaaz  which uses the  Internet to mobilize people and now has almost     million members  and I now run Purpose  which  is a home for these kinds of technology powered movements. So what's the moral of this story  Is the moral of this story  you know what  the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone  This is another story of  tech determinism  Well  I would argue that there's  actually more to it than that. I'd argue that in the last    years  something more fundamental has changed than just new tech. I would argue that there has been a fundamental shift in the balance of power in the world. You ask any activist how  to understand the world  and they'll say   Look at where the power is  who has it  how it's shifting.  And I think we all sense that  something big is happening. So Henry Timms and I   Henry's a fellow movement builder   got talking one day and  we started to think  how can we make sense of this new world  How can we describe it and give it a framework that makes it more useful  Because we realized that many of the lessons that we were discovering in movements actually applied all over the world in many sectors of our society. So I want to introduce you to this framework  Old power  meet new power. And I want to talk to you about what new power is today. New power is the deployment of mass participation  and peer coordination   these are the two key elements   to create change and shift outcomes. And we see new power all around us. This is Beppe Grillo he was a populist Italian blogger who  with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools  won more than    percent of the vote in recent Italian elections. This is Airbnb  which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without owning a single square foot of real estate. This is Kickstarter  which we know has raised over a billion dollars from more than five million people. Now  we're familiar with all of these models. But what's striking is the commonalities  the structural features of  these new models and how they differ from old power. Let's look a little bit at this. Old power is held like a currency. New power works like a current. Old power is held by a few. New power isn't held by a few  it's made by many. Old power is all about download  and new power uploads. And you see a whole set of  characteristics that you can trace  whether it's in media or  politics or education. So we've talked a little bit  about what new power is. Let's  for a second  talk about  what new power isn't. New power is not your Facebook page. I assure you that having a  social media strategy can enable you to do just as much download as you used to do when you had the radio. Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad  I assure you that his Facebook page has not embraced the power of participation. New power is not inherently positive. In fact  this isn't an normative argument that we're making  there are many good things  about new power  but it can produce bad outcomes. More participation  more peer coordination  sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things  like things  for example   in the medical profession that we want new power  to get nowhere near. And thirdly  new power is not the inevitable victor. In fact  unsurprisingly  as many of these new power models get to scale  what you see is this massive pushback from the forces of old power. Just look at this really  interesting epic struggle going on right now between  Edward Snowden and the NSA. You'll note that only one of  the two people on this slide is currently in exile. And so  it's not at all clear that new power will be  the inevitable victor. That said  keep one thing in mind  We're at the beginning of a very steep curve. So you think about some of  these new power models  right  These were just like someone's garage idea a few years ago  and now they're disrupting  entire industries. And so  what's interesting about new power  is the way it feeds on itself. Once you have an experience of new power  you tend to expect and  want more of it. So let's say you've used a peer to peer lending platform like Lending Tree or Prosper  then you've figured out that you don't need the bank  and who wants the bank  right  And so  that experience tends  to embolden you it tends to make you want more participation across more aspects of your life. And what this gives rise to is a set of values. We talked about the models that new power has engendered   the Airbnbs  the Kickstarters. What about the values  And this is an early sketch at what new power values look like. New power values prize transparency above all else. It's almost a religious  belief in transparency  a belief that if you shine  a light on something  it will be better. And remember that in the   th  century  this was not at all true. People thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors and make comfortable agreements. New power values of informal  networked governance. New power folks would never  have invented the U.N. today  for better or worse. New power values participation  and new power is all about do it yourself. In fact  what's interesting  about new power is that it eschews some of  the professionalization and specialization that was all the rage in the   th century. So what's interesting about these new power values and these new power models is what they mean for organizations. So we've spent a bit of time thinking  how can we plot organizations on a two by two where  essentially  we look at new power values and new power models and see where different people sit  We started with a U.S. analysis  and let me show you  some interesting findings. So the first is Apple. In this framework  we actually described Apple as an old power company. That's because the ideology  the governing ideology of Apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in Cupertino. It's absolutely about that beautiful   perfect thing descending upon us in perfection. And it does not value  as a  company  transparency. In fact  it's very secretive. Now  Apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world. So this shows that you can still pursue a successful  old power strategy. But one can argue that there's  real vulnerabilites in that model. I think another interesting comparison is that of the Obama campaign versus the Obama presidency. Now  I like President Obama  but he ran with new  power at his back  right  And he said to people  we are the ones we've been waiting for. And he used crowdfunding to power a campaign. But when he got into office  he governed like more or less  all the other presidents did. And this is a really interesting trend  is when new power gets powerful  what happens  So this is a framework you  should look at and think about where your own organization sits on it. And think about where it should be in five or    years. So what do you do if you're old power  Well  if you're there  thinking  in old power  this won't happen to us. Then just look at the Wikipedia entry for Encyclop dia Britannica. Let me tell you  it's a very sad read. But if you are old power  the most important thing you  can do is to occupy yourself before others occupy you  before you are occupied. Imagine that a group of your biggest skeptics are camped in the heart of your organization asking the toughest questions and they can see everything inside of your organization. And ask them  would they  like what they see and should our model change  What about if you're new power  Is new power kind of just  riding the wave to glory  I would argue no. I would argue that there are some very real challenges to new power in this nascent phase. Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street example for a moment. Occupy was this incredible example  of new power  the purest example of new power. And yet  it failed to consolidate. So the energy that it created was great for the meme phase  but they were so committed to participation  that they never got anything done. And in fact that model means that the challenge for new power is  how do you use institutional power without being institutionalized  One the other end of the spectra is Uber. Uber is an amazing  highly scalable new power model. That network is getting denser and denser by the day. But what's really interesting  about Uber is it hasn't really adopted new power values. This is a real quote from  the Uber CEO recently  He says   Once we get rid of the dude  in the car    he means drivers    Uber will be cheaper.  Now  new power models live and die by the strength of their networks. By whether the drivers and the consumers who use the service actually believe in it. Because they're not an exercise  of top down perfectionism  they are about the network. And so  the challenge  and this is why it's in no way surprising  is that Uber's drivers  are now unionizing. It's extraordinary. Uber's drivers are turning on Uber. And the challenge for Uber   this isn't an easy situation for them   is that they are locked into a broader superstrcuture that is really old power. They've raised more than a billion  dollars in the capital markets. Those markets expect a financial return  and they way you get a financial return is by squeezing and squeezing your users and your drivers for more and more value and giving that value to your investors. So the big question about the future  of new power  in my view  is  Will that old power just emerge  So will new power elites just become old power and squeeze  Or will that new power base bite back  Will the next big Uber be co owned by Uber drivers  And I think this going  to be a very interesting structural question. Finally  think about new power being more than just an entity that scales things that make us have slightly  better consumer experiences. My call to action for new power is to not be an island. We have major structural problems in the world today that could benefit enormously from the kinds of mass participation and peer coordination that these new power players know so well how to generate. And we badly need them to  turn their energies and their power to big  what economists might call public goods problems  that are often beyond markets where investors can easily be found. And I think if we can do that  we might be able to fundamentally change not only human beings' sense of  their own agency and power   because I think that's the most wonderful thing about new power  is that people feel more powerful   but we might also be able to change the way we relate to each other and the way we relate to  authority and institutions. And to me  that's absolutely worth trying for. Thank you very much. Fifty four percent of the world's population lives in our cities. In developing countries  one third of that population is living in slums. Seventy five percent of global energy consumption occurs in our cities  and    percent of gas emissions that cause global warming come from our cities. So things that you and I might think about as global problems  like climate change  the energy crisis or poverty  are really  in many ways  city problems. They will not be solved unless people who live in cities  like most of us  actually start doing a better job  because right now  we are  not doing a very good one. And that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life  first  our citizens' willingness to engage with democratic institutions  second  our cities' ability to really include all of their residents  and lastly  our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives. When it comes to engagement  the data is very clear. Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '  s  and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before  and if those numbers are bad at the national level  at the level of our cities  they are just dismal. In the last two years  two of the world's most consolidated  oldest democracies  the U.S. and France  held nationwide municipal elections. In France  voter turnout hit a record low. Almost    percent of voters decided not to show up. In the U.S.  the numbers were even scarier. In some American cities  voter turnout was close to five percent. I'll let that sink in for a second. We're talking about democratic cities in which    percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders. The city of L.A.  a city of four million people  elected its mayor with just a bit over         votes. That was the lowest turnout the city had seen in     years. Right here  in my city of Rio  in spite of mandatory voting  almost    percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections. When it comes to inclusiveness  our cities are not the best cases of success either  and again  you don't need to look very far in order to find proof of that. The city of Rio is incredibly unequal. This is Leblon. Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood. And this is Complexo do Alem o. This is where over        of the city's poorest residents live. Leblon has an HDI  a Human Development Index  of .   . That is higher than Norway  Switzerland or Sweden. Complexo do Alem o has an HDI of .   . It sits somewhere in between the HDI of Algeria and Gabon. So Rio  like so many cities across the global South  is a place where you can go from northern Europe to sub Saharan Africa in the space of    minutes. If you drive  that is. If you take public transit  it's about two hours. And lastly  perhaps most importantly  cities  with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable  could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish. We like being around people. We are social animals. Instead  countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy. The United States population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the past three decades  and the main reason is this. The American way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many  many American cities  and as a result  they have seen a decline of relations  of the things that make us happy. Many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity  honesty  and social and civic participation. So how do we start building cities that make us care  Cities that value their most important asset  the incredible diversity of the people who live in them  Cities that make us happy  Well  I believe that if we want to change what our cities look like  then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results  that we have right now. We need a participation revolution  and we need it fast. The idea of voting as our  only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore. People are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it's time to delegate that power to someone else. If the protests that swept Brazil in June      have taught us anything  it's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context  we are beaten up  humiliated or arrested. And this needs to change  because when it does  not only will people re engage with the structures of representation  but also complement these structures with direct  effective  and  collective decision making  decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature  decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live. But there is a catch  obviously  Enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare  and there's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role  by making it easier for people to organize  communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time. Unfortunately for us  when it comes to fostering democratic processes  our city governments have not used technology to its full potential. So far  most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city  potholes  fallen trees or broken lamps. They have also  to a lesser extent  invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them  just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice  I had to be in bed by   p.m.  but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas. That's not participation  and in fact  governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters   the way we allocate our budget  the way we occupy our land  and the way we manage our natural resources. Those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest themselves in our cities. The good news is  and I do have good news to share with you  we don't need to wait for governments to do this. I have reason to believe that it's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation. Three years ago  I cofounded an organization called Meu Rio  and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio to organize around causes and places that they care about in their own city  and have an impact on those causes and places every day. In these past three years  Meu Rio grew to a network of         citizens of Rio. About    percent of those  members are young people aged    to   . That is one in every    young people of that age in Rio today. Amongst our members is this adorable little girl  Bia  to your right  and Bia was just    years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition. Her school actually ranks among the best public schools in the country  and it was going to be demolished by the Rio de Janeiro state government to build  I kid you not  a parking lot for the World Cup right before the event happened. Bia started a campaign  and we even watched her school      through webcam monitoring  and many months afterwards  the government changed their minds. Bia's school stayed in place. There's also Jovita. She's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about    years ago  and since then  she has been looking for her daughter. In that process  she found out that first  she was not alone. In the last year alone              people disappeared in the state of Rio. But she also found out that in spite of that  Rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases. In other Brazilian cities  those systems have helped solve up to    percent of missing persons cases. She started a campaign  and after the secretary of  security got        emails from people asking him to do this  he responded  and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases. It was open to the public at the end of last month  and Jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy. And then  there is Leandro. Leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in Rio  and he created a recycling project in the slum. At the end of last year  December     he received an eviction order by the Rio de Janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years. The plan was to hand it over to a developer  who planned to turn it into a construction site. Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools  the Pressure Cooker  the same one that Bia and Jovita used  and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve. These stories make me happy  but not just because they have happy endings. They make me happy because they are happy beginnings. The teacher and parent community at Bia's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further. Leandro has ambitious plans to take his model to other low income communities in Rio  and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created. Bia  Jovita and Leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city  governments around the world need to know  We are ready. As citizens  we are ready to decide on our common destinies  because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone  and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another  and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now. With the Our Cities network  the Meu Rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities. We have already started doing it in S o Paulo with incredible results  and want to take it to cities around the world through a network of citizen centric  citizen led organizations that can inspire us  challenge us  and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives. It is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking lots  community driven recycling projects or construction sites  loneliness or solidarity  cars or buses  and it is our responsibility to do that now  for ourselves  for our families  for the people who make our lives worth living  and for the incredible creativity  beauty  and wonder that make our cities  in spite of all of their problems  the greatest invention of our time. Obrigado. Thank you. You know  it's a big privilege for me to be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world  the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. These islands   Mauritius  Rodrigues  and R union   along with the island of Madagascar  they are blessed with unique plants found nowhere else in the world. And today I will tell you  about five of them and their particular features and why these plants are so unique. Take a look at this plant. I call it benjoin in the local vernacular  and the botanical name  is Terminalia bentzoe  subspecies bentzoe. This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius  and its particular feature is its heterophylly. What do I mean by heterophylly  It's that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes. Now  these plants have evolved very far away from the mainland  and within specific ecosystems. Often  these particular features have evolved as a response to the threat presented by the local fauna  in this case  grazing tortoises. Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight  and as such  they tend to avoid the plants they don't recognize. So this evolutionary  foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals  and protects it and of course  ensures its survival. Now the question you're  probably asking yourself is  why is she telling us all these stories  The reason for that is that we tend to overlook the diversity and the variety of the natural world. These particular habitats are unique and they are host to a whole lot of plants. We don't realize how valuable and how precious these resources are  and yet  through our insouciance  we keep on destroying them. We're all familiar with the macro impact of urbanization  climate change  resource exploitation  but when that one last plant   or animal for that matter   when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this Earth  we would have lost an entire subset of the Earth's biology  and with it  important plants  with medicinal potential or which could have ingredients that would speak to the cosmetic  nutrition  pharma  and even the ethno veterinary sectors  be gone forever. And here we have a very prime example of the iconic dodo  which comes from Mauritius  and  of course  we know is  now a symbol of extinction. We know plants have a  fundamental role to play. Well  first of all  they feed us and they also give us  the oxygen we breathe  but plants are also the source of important  biologically active ingredients that we should be studying very carefully  because human societies over the millennia  they have developed important knowledge  cultural traditions  and important plant based medicinal resources. Here's a data point   .  percent of the entire land surface is home to    percent of the species of higher plants     percent of the species of vertebrates  and this  .  percent represents the    biodiversity hotspots in the world  and this  .  percent of the entire land surface already provides for    percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on. And as you can see  the island of Mauritius where I work and where I live  belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot  and I study the unique plants on the island for their  biomedical applications. Now  let's go back again to that first plant I showed you  the one  of course  with  different shaped leaves and different sizes  Terminalia bentzoe  subspecies bentzoe  a plant only found in Mauritius. Now  the local people  they used a decoction of the leaves against infectious diseases. Now our work  that is  the scientific validation of  this traditional information  has shown that precisely that leaf extract shows activity  potent activity  against a wide range of bacteria that could be pathogenic to humans. Now  could this plant be the answer to antibiotic resistance  You know  antibiotic resistance is proving to be a big challenge globally. While we may not be sure  one thing is certain  we will not want this plant to disappear. But the harsh reality is that this particular plant is in fact considered to be vulnerable in its natural habitat. This brings me to another example. This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate in the local vernacular. The botanical name is Psiadia arguta. It's a plant which is rare  which is endemic to Mauritius. It used to grow on the mainland  but through the sheer  pressures of urbanization has been pushed out of the mainland  and we've managed to bring it back from the brink of extinction by developing in vitro plants which are now growing in the wild. Now  one thing I must  point out straightaway is that not all plants can be developed in vitro. While we humans  we are  happy in our comfort zone  these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved  and they don't react   endemic plants don't react to very harsh  changes in their ecosystem  and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change  for example  is posing to these plants. Now  the local people again use the leaves in traditional medicine against respiratory problems. Now  our preliminary labwork on the leaf extract has shown that precisely these  leaves contain ingredients that are very close   in terms of structures  chemical structures  to those medicines which are sold in the chemist's shop against asthma. So who knows what humanity will benefit from should this plant decide  to reveal all its secrets. Now  I come from the developing world where we are forever being  challenged with this issue of population explosion. Africa is the continent  which is getting younger  and whenever one talks  about population explosion  one talks about the issue of food security as being the other side of the same coin. Now this plant here  the baobab  could be part of the answer. It's an underutilized  neglected food plant. It defines the landscape of West Africa  where it is known as the tree of life  and later on I will tell you why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. Now interestingly  there are many legends which are associated with this plant. Because of its sheer size  it was meant to be lording over lesser plants  so God didn't like this arrogance  uprooted it  and planted it upside down  hence its particular shape. And if you look at this tree again within the African context  in West Africa  it's known  as the palaver tree  because it performs great social functions. Now if you have a problem in the community  meeting under the palaver tree with the chiefs or the tribesmen would be synonymous to trying to find a solution to that particular problem  and also to reinforce trust and respect among members of the community. From the scientific point of view  there are eight species of baobab in the world. There's one from Africa  one from Australia  and six are endemic to the island of Madagascar. The one I have showed you is the one from Africa  Adansonia digitata. Now  the flower  this  beautiful white flower  it opens at night  is pollinated by bats  and it gives rise to the fruit which is curiously known as the monkey apple. The monkeys are not stupid animals. They know what's good for them. Now  if you open the fruit of the baobab  you'll see a white  floury pulp  which is very rich in nutrients and has got protein  more protein than in human milk. Yes  you heard right  more protein than in human milk. And this is one of the reasons why the nutrition companies of this world  they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food. The seeds give an oil  a very stable oil which is sought after  by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body lotions  for example. And if you look at the trunk  the trunk  of course  safeguards water  which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler  and the leaves are used in traditional medicine against infectious disease. Now  you can see now why the Africans consider it to be the tree of life. It's a complete plant  and in fact  the sheer size of these trees is hiding a massive potential  not only for the pharma  nutrition  and the cosmetic industry. What I have showed you here is only the species from Africa  Adansonia digitata. We have six species yet in Madagascar  and we don't know what  is the potential of this plant  but one thing we know is that the flora is considered to be  threatened with extinction. Let me take you to Africa again  and introduce you to one of my very favorite  the resurrection plant. Now here you'll find that even Jesus has competition. Now  this plant here has developed remarkable tolerance to drought  which enables it to withstand up to    percent dehydration  over the period of a year without damage  and yet it can regenerate  itself almost completely overnight  over    hours  and flower. Now  us human beings  we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth. We don't want to get old  and rightly so. Why should we  especially if you can afford it  And this gives you an indication of what the plant looks like before. Now  if you are an inexperienced gardener  the first thing you'll do  when you visit the garden is to uproot this plant because it's dead. But if you water it  this is what you get. Absolutely amazing. Now  if you look at our aging process  the aging process is in fact the loss of water from the upper epidermis  resulting in wrinkling as we know it  especially women  we are so conscious of this. And this plant  in fact  is giving  the cosmetic chemists very important ingredients that are actually finding ways to slow down the aging process and at the same time reinforce the cells against the onslaught of environmental toxins. Now  these four examples I have just given you are just a very tiny reminder as to how our health and our survival are closely linked to the health and the resilience of our ecosystem  and why we should be very careful about preserving biodiversity. Every time a forest is cut down  every time a marsh is filled in  it is a potential lab that goes with it  and which we will never  ever recover. And I know what I'm talking about  coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo. Let me finish with just one last example. Conservation issues are normally guided towards rare  endemic plants  but what we call exotic plants  that is  the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world  they also need to be considered. You know why  Because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant. So let's take a look at this plant here  Centella asiatica. It's a weed. We call it a weed. Now  Centella asiatica  grows across the world in many different habitats    in Africa  in Asia   and this plant has been instrumental in providing a solution  to that dreadful disease called leprosy in Madagascar in the     s. Now  while Centella  grows across the world   in Africa  in Asia    the best quality Centella comes from Madagascar  because that Centella contains the three vital ingredients which are sought after by the pharma and the cosmetic companies. And the cosmetic companies  are already using it to make regenerating cream. Now  there is an ancient saying that for every disease known to mankind  there is a plant to cure it. Now  you may not  believe in ancient sayings. You may think they're obsolete now that our science and  technology are so powerful. So you may look on Centella as being an insignificant  humble weed  which  if destroyed  won't be missed. But you know  there is no such thing as a weed. It's a plant. It's a living biological lab that may well have answers to the question that we may have  but we have to ensure that it has the right to live. Thank you. I grew up diagnosed as phobically shy  and  like at least    other people in a room of this size  I was a stutterer. Do you dare raise your hand  And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us  because when we are treated that way  we feel invisible sometimes  or talked around and at. And as I started to look at people  which is mostly all I did  I noticed that some people really wanted attention and recognition. Remember  I was young then. So what did they do  What we still do perhaps too often. We talk about ourselves. And yet there are other people I observed who had what I called a mutuality mindset. In each situation  they found a way to talk about us and create that  us  idea. So my idea to reimagine the world is to see it one where we all become greater opportunity makers with and for others. There's no greater opportunity or call for action for us now than to become opportunity makers who use best talents together more often for the greater good and accomplish things we couldn't have done on our own. And I want to talk to you about that  because even more than giving  even more than giving  is the capacity for us to do something smarter together for the greater good that lifts us both up and that can scale. That's why I'm sitting here. But I also want to point something else out  Each one of you is better than anybody else at something. That disproves that popular notion that if you're the smartest person in the room  you're in the wrong room. So let me tell you about a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back  and I met this up and coming actress  and we were soon talking about something that we both felt passionately about  public art. And she had the fervent belief that every new building in Los Angeles should have public art in it. She wanted a regulation for it  and she fervently started   who is here from Chicago    she fervently started talking about these bean shaped reflective sculptures in Millennium Park  and people would walk up to it and they'd smile in the reflection of it  and they'd pose and they'd vamp and they'd take selfies together  and they'd laugh. And as she was talking  a  thought came to my mind. I said   I know someone you ought to meet. He's getting out of San Quentin  in a couple of weeks     and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect.  He spent five years in solitary  and I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin  and he's articulate and he's rather easy on  the eyes because he's buff. He had workout regime he did every day. I think she was following me at that point. I said   He'd be an unexpected ally.  And not just that. There's James. He's an architect and he's a professor  and he loves place making  and place making is when you have those mini plazas and those urban walkways and where they're dotted with art  where people draw and  come up and talk sometimes. I think they'd make good allies. And indeed they were. They met together. They prepared. They spoke in front of the  Los Angeles City Council. And the council members not only passed the regulation  half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards. They were startling   compelling and credible. You can't buy that. What I'm asking you to consider is what kind of opportunity  makers we might become  because more than wealth or fancy titles or a lot of contacts  it's our capacity to connect around each other's  better side and bring it out. And I'm not saying this is easy  and I'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with  but what I want to suggest is  this is an opportunity. I started thinking about it way back when I was a  Wall Street Journal reporter and I was in Europe and I was supposed to cover trends and trends that transcended business or politics or lifestyle. So I had to have contacts in different worlds very different than mine  because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends. And third  I had to write the story in a way stepping into the reader's shoes  so they could see how these  trends could affect their lives. That's what opportunity makers do. And here's a strange thing  Unlike an increasing number of Americans who are working and living  and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme  opportunity makers are actively seeking situations with people unlike them  and they're building relationships  and because they do that  they have trusted relationships where they can bring the right team in and recruit them to solve a  problem better and faster and seize more opportunities. They're not affronted by differences  they're fascinated by them  and that is a huge shift in mindset  and once you feel it  you  want it to happen a lot more. This world is calling out for us  to have a collective mindset  and I believe in doing that. It's especially important now. Why is it important now  Because things can be devised like drones and drugs and data collection  and they can be devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes and then  as we know from the news every day  they can be used for dangerous ones. It calls on us  each of us  to a higher calling. But here's the icing on the cake  It's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that's probably your greatest  as an institution or an individual. It's after you've had that experience and you trust each other. It's the unexpected things that you devise later on you never could have predicted. For example  Marty is the husband  of that actress I mentioned  and he watched them  when they were practicing  and he was soon talking to Wally  my friend the ex con  about that exercise regime. And he thought  I have a set of racquetball courts. That guy could teach it. A lot of people who work there are members at my courts. They're frequent travelers. They could practice in their hotel room  no equipment provided. That's how Wally got hired. Not only that  years later he was also teaching racquetball. Years after that  he was teaching the racquetball teachers. What I'm suggesting is  when  you connect with people around a shared interest and action  you're accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future  and I think that's what we're looking at. We open ourselves up to those opportunities  and in this room  are key players in technology  key players who are uniquely positioned to do this  to scale systems and projects together. So here's what I'm calling for you to do. Remember the three traits of opportunity makers. Opportunity makers keep honing their top strength and they become pattern seekers. They get involved in different  worlds than their worlds so they're trusted and they  can see those patterns  and they communicate to connect around sweet spots of shared interest. So what I'm asking you is  the world is hungry. I truly believe  in my firsthand experience  the world is hungry for us to unite together as opportunity makers and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do   I know that firsthand   and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own. Just remember  as Dave Liniger once said   You can't succeed coming to the potluck with only a fork.  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  If there's any power in design  that's the power of synthesis. The more complex the problem  the more the need for simplicity. So allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design's power of synthesis. Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization. It's a fact that people are moving towards cities. and even if counterintuitive  it's good news. Evidence shows that people are better off in cities. But there's a problem that I would call the   S  menace  The scale  speed  and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon has no precedence in history. For you to have an idea  out of the three billion  people living in cities today  one billion are under the line of poverty. By       out of the five billion people that will be living in cities  two billion are going to  be under the line of poverty. That means that we will have to build a one million person city per week with        dollars per family during the next    years. A one million person city per week with        dollars per family. If we don't solve this equation  it is not that people  will stop coming to cities. They will come anyhow  but they will live in slums  favelas and informal settlements. So what to do  Well  an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves. A clue could be in this  question we were asked    years ago. We were asked to accommodate     families that had been occupying illegally half a hectare in the center of the city of Iquique  in the north of Chile using a         subsidy with which we had to buy the land  provide the infrastructure  and build the houses that   in the best of the cases  would be of around    square meters. And by the way  they said  the cost of the land  because it's in the center of the city  is three times more than what social housing can normally afford. Due to the difficulty of the question  we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints  and we started a participatory design process  and testing what was  available there in the market. Detached houses     families could be accommodated. Row houses     families.       families   The only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height  and they threatened us to go on a hunger strike if we even dared to offer this as a solution  because they could not  make the tiny apartments expand. So the conclusion with the families   and this is important   not our conclusion   with the families  was that we had a problem. We had to innovate. So what did we do  Well  a middle class family lives reasonably well in around    square meters  but when there's no money  what the market does is to reduce the size of the house to    square meters. What we said was  what if  instead of thinking of    square meters as a small house  why don't we consider it half of a good one  When you rephrase the problem as half of a good house instead of a small one  the key question is  which half do we do  And we thought we had  to do with public money the half that families won't  be able to do individually. We identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half of a house  and we went back to the  families to do two things  join forces and split tasks. Our design was something in between a building and a house. As a building  it could pay for expensive  well located land  and as a house  it could expand. If  in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house  families kept their  network and their jobs  we knew that the expansion  would begin right away. So we went from this initial social housing to a middle class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks. This was our first project in Iquique    years ago. This is our last project in Chile. Different designs  same principle  You provide the frame  and from then on  families take over. So the purpose of design  trying to understand and  trying to give an answer to the   S  menace  scale  speed  and scarcity  is to channel people's own building capacity. We won't solve the one million people per week equation unless we use people's own power for building. So  with the right design  slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution. The second case is how design can contribute to sustainability. In       we entered the competition for the Angelini Innovation Center  and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation. It is accepted that for such an aim  knowledge creation  interaction among people   face to face contact  it's important  and we agreed on that. But for us  the question  of the right environment was a very literal question. We wanted to have a working space with the right light  with the right temperature  with the right air. So we asked ourselves  Does the typical office building help us in that sense  Well  how does that  building look  typically  It's a collection of floors  one on top of each other  with a core in the center with elevators  stairs   pipes  wires  everything  and then a glass skin on the outside that  due to direct sun radiation  creates a huge greenhouse effect inside. In addition to that  let's say a guy working on the seventh floor goes every single day  through the third floor  but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on. So we thought  well  maybe  we have to turn this scheme inside out. And what we did was  let's have an open atrium  a hollowed core  the same collection of floors  but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter  so that when the sun hits  it's not impacting directly glass  but a wall. When you have an open atrium inside  you are able to see what others are doing from within the building  and you have a better way to control light  and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter  then you are preventing direct sun radiation. You may also open those windows and get cross ventilation. We just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares  outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building. None of this is rocket science. You don't require sophisticated programming. It's not about technology. This is just archaic   primitive common sense  and by using common sense  we went from     kilowatts per square meter per year  which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower  to    kilowatts per square meter per year. So with the right design  sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common sense. Last case I would like  to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters. You may know that Chile  in       was hit by an  .  Richter scale earthquake and tsunami  and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the Constituci n  in the southern part of the country. We were given     days  three months  to design almost everything  from public buildings to public space  street grid  transportation  housing  and mainly how to protect the city against future tsunamis. This was new in Chilean urban design  and there were in the  air a couple of alternatives. First one  Forbid installation on ground zero. Thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation. This is exactly what's being discussed in Japan nowadays  and if you have a disciplined population like the Japanese  this may work  but we know that in Chile  this land is going to be  occupied illegally anyhow  so this alternative was  unrealistic and undesirable. Second alternative  build a big wall  heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves. This alternative was conveniently lobbied by big building companies  because it meant    million  dollars in contracts  and was also politically preferred  because it required no land expropriation. But Japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless. So this alternative was irresponsible. As in the housing process  we had to include the community in the way of finding a solution for this  and we started a participatory design process. Vote for Constituci n. Go to the Open House and express your options. Participate  Fisherman  I am a fisherman. Twenty five fishermen work for me. Where should I take them  To the forest  Man  So why can't we have a concrete defense  Done well  of course. Man    I am the history of Constituci n. And you come here to tell me that I cannot keep on living here  My whole family has lived here  I raised my children here  and my children will also  raise their children here. and my grandchildren  and everyone else will. But why are you imposing this on me  You  You are imposing this on me  In danger zone I am not authorized to build. He himself is saying that. Man    No  no  no  Nieves... Alejandro Aravena  I don't know if you were able to read the subtitles  but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie  romantic  let's all dream together about  the future of the city kind of thing. It is actually    Applause  It is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer. It is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question. There is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question. So it was pretty obvious after this process that  well  we chicken out here and go away because it's too tense  or we go even further in asking  what else is bothering you  What other problems do you have and you want us to take  care of now that the city will have to be rethought from scratch  And what they said was  look  fine to protect the city  against future tsunamis  we really appreciate  but the next one  is going to come in  what     years  But every single year  we have problems of flooding due to rain. In addition  we are in the middle of the forest region of the country  and our public space sucks. It's poor and it's scarce. And the origin of the city  our identity  is not really connected to the buildings that fell  it is connected to the river  but the river cannot be accessed publicly  because its shores are privately owned. So we thought that we had to produce a third alternative  and our approach was  against geographical threats  have geographical answers. What if  in between the city and the sea we have a forest  a forest that doesn't try to resist the energy of nature  but dissipates it by introducing friction  A forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding  That may pay the historical debt of public space  and that may provide  finally  democratic access to the river. So as a conclusion of the participatory design  the alternative was validated politically and socially  but there was still the problem of the cost     million dollars. So what we did was a survey in the public investment system  and found out that there  were three ministries with three projects in  the exact same place  not knowing of the existence  of the other projects. The sum of them     million dollars. So design's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities  which is not money but coordination. By doing so  we were able to save four million dollars  and  that is why the forest is today under construction. So be it the force of self construction  the force of common sense  or the force of nature  all these forces need to be translated into form  and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement  bricks  or wood. It is life itself. Design's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life. Thank you so much. Dre Urhahn  This theater  is built on Copacabana  which is the most famous  beach in the world  but    kilometers away from here in the North Zone of Rio lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro  and roughly        people live there. Now  the people here in Rio mostly know Vila Cruzeiro from the news  and unfortunately  news  from Vila Cruzeiro often is not good news. But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins. Jeroen Koolhaas  Ten years  ago  we first came to Rio to shoot a documentary  about life in the favelas. Now  we learned that favelas  are informal communities. They emerged over the years when immigrants from the countryside came to the cities looking for work  like cities within the cities  known for problems like crime  poverty  and the violent drug war between police and the drug gangs. So what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built  with their own hands  without a master plan and like a giant work in progress. Where we're from  in Holland  everything is planned. We even have rules for  how to follow the rules. DU  So the last day of  filming  we ended up in Vila Cruzeiro  and  we were sitting down and we had a drink  and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses  and most of these houses looked unfinished  and they had walls of bare brick  but we saw some of these houses which were plastered and painted  and suddenly we had this idea  what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted  And then we imagined one big design  one big work of art. Who would expect something like that in a place like this  So we thought  would that even be possible  So first we started to count the houses  but we soon lost count. But somehow the idea stuck. JK  We had a friend. He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro. His name was Nanko  and he also liked the idea. He said   You know  everybody here would pretty much love  to have their houses plastered and painted. It's when a house is finished.  So he introduced us to the right people  and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew. We picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here. We made a few designs  and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best. So we started painting   and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue  and we thought that looked  already pretty good. But they hated it. The people who lived there really hated it. They said   What did you do  You painted our house in  exactly the same color as the police station.  In a favela  that is not a good thing. Also the same color as the prison cell. So we quickly went ahead  and we painted the boy  and then we thought we were finished  we were really happy  but still  it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us  and they said   You know   there's a boy flying the kite  but where is his kite   We said   Uh  it's art. You know  you have to imagine the kite.  And they said   No  no  no   we want to see the kite.  So we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill  so that you could see  the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite. So the local news started writing about it  which was great  and then even The Guardian wrote about it   Notorious slum becomes open air gallery.  JK  So  encouraged by this success  we went back to Rio for a second project  and we stumbled upon this street. It was covered in concrete  to prevent mudslides  and somehow we saw a sort of river in it  and we imagined this river to be a river in Japanese style with koi carp swimming upstream. So we decided to paint that river  and we invited Rob Admiraal  who is a tattoo artist  and he specialized in the Japanese style. So little did we know that we would spend almost an entire year painting that river  together with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor  who lived nearby. And we even moved into the neighborhood when one of the guys that  lived on the street  Elias  told us that we could come  and live in his house  together with his family  which was fantastic. Unfortunately  during that time  another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs. We learned that during those times  people in communities  really stick together during these times of hardship  but we also learned a  very important element  the importance of barbecues.   Laughter  Because  when you throw a barbecue  it turns you from a guest into a host  so we decided to throw one almost every other week  and we got to know everybody  in the neighborhood. JK  We still had this  idea of the hill  though. DU  Yeah  yeah  we were talking about the scale of this  because this painting was incredibly big  and it was insanely detailed  and this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves. But we figured that maybe   during this process  all the time that we had  spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself. JK  So after all that time  this hill  this idea was still there  and we started to make sketches  models  and we figured something out. We figured that our ideas  our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time. And we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of Rio  which is called Santa Marta  and we made a design for this place which looked like this  and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if  your idea is ridiculously big  it's easier to get people to  go along with this.  Laughter  And the people of Santa Marta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this. And this image somehow  went all over the world. DU  So then we received  an unexpected phone call from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program  and they had this question if this idea  our approach  if this would actually  work in North Philly  which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States. So we immediately said yes. We had no idea how  but it seemed like a very  interesting challenge  so we did exactly the  same as we did in Rio  and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing. So the project took almost two years to complete  and we made individual designs for every single house on  the avenue that we painted  and we made these designs together with the local store owners   the building owners  and a team of about a dozen  young men and women. They were hired  and then they were trained as painters  and together they transformed their own neighborhood  the whole street  into a  giant patchwork of color. And at the end  the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment. JK  So now we had painted a whole street. How about we do this whole hill now  We started looking for funding  but instead  we just ran into questions  like  how many houses  are you going to paint  How many square meters is that  How much paint are you going to use  and how many people are you going to employ  And we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer  all those questions  but then we thought  in order to answer all those questions  you have to know exactly  what you're going to do before you actually get there and start. And maybe it's a mistake  to think like that. It would lose some of the  magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there  you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own. DU  So what we did is we decided to take this  plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea  which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art. And instead of looking for funding  we started a crowdfunding campaign  and in a little over a month  more than       people put together and donated over         dollars. So for us  this was an amazing  moment  because now   because now we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built  from the ground on up  bottom up  with no master plan. JK  So we went back   and we employed Angelo  and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro  very talented guy  and he knows almost everybody there  and then we employed Elias  our former landlord who invited us into his house  and he's a master of construction. Together with them  we decided where to start. We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro  and houses are being plastered as we speak. And the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next. They're even printing t shirts  they're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody  and talking to the press. This article about Angelo appeared. DU  So while this is happening  we are bringing this  idea all over the world. So  like the project we  did in Philadelphia  we are also invited to do workshops  for instance in Cura ao  and right now we're planning  a huge project in Haiti. JK  So the favela was not only the place where this idea started  it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan  because these communities are informal   this was the inspiration   and in a communal effort   together with the people  you can almost work like in an orchestra  where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony. DU  So we want to thank everybody who wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way  and we are looking at continuing. JK  Yeah. And so one day pretty soon  when the colors start  going up on these walls  we hope more people will join us  and join this big dream  and maybe one day  the  whole of Vila Cruzeiro will be painted. DU  Thank you. The first patient to ever be  treated with an antibiotic was a policeman in Oxford. On his day off from work  he was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden. That small scratch became infected. Over the next few days   his head was swollen with abscesses  and in fact his eye was so infected that they had to take it out  and by February of       this poor man was on the verge of dying. He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford  and fortunately for him  a small team of doctors led by a Dr. Howard Florey had managed to synthesize a very small amount of penicillin  a drug that had been discovered    years before by Alexander Fleming but had never actually been  used to treat a human  and indeed no one even  knew if the drug would work  if it was full of impurities  that would kill the patient  but Florey and his team figured if they had to use it   they might as well use it on someone who was going to die anyway. So they gave Albert Alexander  this Oxford policeman  the drug  and within    hours  he started getting better. His fever went down   his appetite came back. Second day  he was doing much better. They were starting to  run out of penicillin  so what they would do  was run with his urine across the road to re synthesize  the penicillin from his urine and give it back to him  and that worked. Day four  well on the way to recovery. This was a miracle. Day five  they ran out of penicillin  and the poor man died. So that story didn't end that well  but fortunately for  millions of other people  like this child who was treated  again in the early     s  who was again dying of a sepsis  and within just six days  you can see  recovered thanks to this  wonder drug  penicillin. Millions have lived  and global health has been transformed. Now  antibiotics have been used for patients like this  but they've also been  used rather frivolously in some instances  for treating someone  with just a cold or the flu  which they might not have  responded to an antibiotic  and they've also been  used in large quantities sub therapeutically  which means in small concentrations  to make chicken and hogs grow faster. Just to save a few pennies on the price of meat  we've spent a lot of  antibiotics on animals  not for treatment  not for sick animals  but primarily for growth promotion. Now  what did that lead us to  Basically  the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria that resistance is now a problem  because we've now selected for just the resistant bacteria. And I'm sure you've all read about this in the newspapers  you've seen this in every magazine that you come across  but I really want you to appreciate the significance of this problem. This is serious. The next slide I'm about to show you is  of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter. Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug  and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug. And you can see in      this is the pattern of resistance  mostly under about    percent across the United States. Now watch what happens  when we play the video. So I don't know where you live  but wherever it is  it certainly is a lot worse now than it was in       and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance. It's a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries  and at the heart of it   you might say  well  isn't this really just a medical issue  If we taught doctors how not  to use antibiotics as much  if we taught patients how  not to demand antibiotics  perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue  and maybe the pharmaceutical companies should be working harder to develop more antibiotics. Now  it turns out that there's something  fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs  which is that if I misuse antibiotics or I use antibiotics  not only am I affected but  others are affected as well  in the same way as if I  choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere  that the costs I impose on others through global climate change go everywhere  and I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration. This is what economists might  call a problem of the commons  and the problem of the commons is exactly what we face in the case  of antibiotics as well  that we don't consider   and we  including individuals  patients  hospitals  entire health systems   do not consider the costs  that they impose on others by the way antibiotics are actually used. Now  that's a problem that's similar to another area that we all know about  which is of fuel use and energy  and of course energy use both depletes energy as well as leads to local pollution  and climate change. And typically  in the case of energy  there are two ways in which you can deal with the problem. One is  we can make better use of the oil that we have  and that's analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics  and we can do this in a number of ways that we'll talk about in a second  but the other option is the   drill  baby  drill  option  which in the case of antibiotics  is to go find new antibiotics. Now  these are not separate. They're related  because if we invest heavily in new oil wells  we reduce the incentives  for conservation of oil in the same way that's going  to happen for antibiotics. The reverse is also going  to happen  which is that if we use our antibiotics appropriately  we don't necessarily have  to make the investments in new drug development. And if you thought that these two were entirely  fully balanced between these two options  you might consider the fact that this is really a game that we're playing. The game is really one of coevolution  and coevolution is  in  this particular picture  between cheetahs and gazelles. Cheetahs have evolved to run faster  because if they didn't run faster  they wouldn't get any lunch. Gazelles have evolved to run faster because if they don't run faster  they would be lunch. Now  this is the game we're playing against the bacteria  except we're not the cheetahs  we're the gazelles  and the bacteria would  just in the course of this little talk  would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant just by selection and trial and error  trying it over and over again. Whereas how do we stay  ahead of the bacteria  We have drug discovery processes  screening molecules  we have clinical trials  and then  when we think we have a drug  then we have the FDA regulatory process. And once we go through all of that  then we try to stay one step ahead of the bacteria. Now  this is clearly not a  game that can be sustained  or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead. We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down  and there are ideas that we  can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well. Now  if you think about how we deal with energy pricing  for instance  we consider emissions taxes  which means we're imposing  the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy. We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well  and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately. There are clean energy subsidies  which are to switch to fuels which don't pollute as much or perhaps don't need fossil fuels. Now  the analogy here is  perhaps we need to move away from using antibiotics  and if you think about it  what are  good substitutes for antibiotics  Well  turns out that anything that reduces the need for the antibiotic would really work  so that could include improving hospital infection control or vaccinating people  particularly against  the seasonal influenza. And the seasonal flu is probably the biggest driver of antibiotic use  both in this country as well as in many other countries  and that could really help. A third option might include something like tradeable permits. And these seem like faraway scenarios  but if you consider the  fact that we might not have antibiotics for many  people who have infections  we might consider the fact that we might want to allocate who actually gets to use some of these antibiotics over others  and some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need  but also on the basis of pricing. And certainly consumer education works. Very often  people overuse antibiotics or prescribe too much without necessarily knowing that they do so  and feedback mechanisms have been found to be useful  both on energy   When you tell someone that they're using a lot of energy during peak hour  they tend to cut back  and the same sort of example has been performed even in the case of antibiotics. A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up on a chart the names of surgeons in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used in the previous month  and this was purely an  informational feedback  there was no shaming  but essentially that provided  some information back to surgeons that maybe they could rethink how they were using antibiotics. Now  there's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well. If you look at the price of penicillin  the cost per day is about    cents. It's a fairly cheap drug. If you take drugs that have been introduced since then   linezolid or daptomycin   those are significantly more expensive  so to a world that has been used to paying    cents a day for antibiotics  the idea of paying     dollars per day seems like a lot. But what is that really telling us  That price is telling us that we should no longer take cheap  effective  antibiotics as a given into the foreseeable future  and that price is a signal to us that perhaps we need to be paying much more attention to conservation. That price is also a signal that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies  in the same way that  gasoline prices are a signal and an impetus  to  say  the development of electric cars. Prices are important signals and we need to pay attention  but we also need to consider the fact that although these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics  they're nothing compared to the price per day of some cancer drugs  which might save a patient's life only for a few months or perhaps a year  whereas antibiotics would potentially save a patient's life forever. So this is going to involve a whole new paradigm shift  and it's also a scary shift because in many parts of this country  in many parts of the world  the idea of paying     dollars for a day of antibiotic treatment is simply unimaginable. So we need to think about that. Now  there are backstop options  which is other alternative technologies that people are working on. It includes bacteriophages  probiotics  quorum sensing  synbiotics. Now  all of these are useful avenues to pursue  and they will become even more lucrative when the price of new  antibiotics starts going higher  and we've seen that the market does actually respond  and the government is now considering ways of subsidizing new  antibiotics and development. But there are challenges here. We don't want to just throw money at a problem. What we want to be able to do is invest in new antibiotics in ways that actually encourage appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics  and that really is the challenge here. Now  going back to these technologies  you all remember the line from that famous dinosaur film   Nature will find a way.  So it's not as if these are  permanent solutions. We really have to remember that  whatever the technology might be  that nature will find some  way to work around it. You might think  well   this is just a problem just with antibiotics and with bacteria  but it turns out that we  have the exact same identical problem in  many other fields as well  with multidrug resistant tuberculosis  which is a serious problem  in India and South Africa. Thousands of patients are dying because the second line drugs are so expensive  and in some instances  even those don't work and you have XDR TB. Viruses are becoming resistant. Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites. Right now  much of the world depends on one drug  artemisinin drugs  essentially to treat malaria. Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged  and if this were to become widespread  that puts at risk the single drug that we have to  treat malaria around the world in a way that's currently  safe and efficacious. Mosquitos develop resistance. If you have kids  you probably  know about head lice  and if you're from New York City  I understand that the  specialty there is bedbugs. So those are also resistant. And we have to bring an example from across the pond. Turns out that rats are  also resistant to poisons. Now  what's common  to all of these things is the idea that we've had these technologies to control nature only for  the last        or     years and essentially in a blink  we have squandered our ability to control  because we have not recognized that natural selection and  evolution was going to find a way to get back  and we need to completely rethink how we're going to use measures to control biological organisms  and rethink how we incentivize the development  introduction  in the case of antibiotics prescription  and use of these valuable resources. And we really now need to  start thinking about them as natural resources. And so we stand at a crossroads. An option is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do business. The alternative is a world in which even a blade of grass is a potentially lethal weapon. Thank you. On January          a young man delivered a report to the United States Congress that    years on  still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today  still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet. That young man wasn't a politician  he wasn't a businessman  a civil rights activist or a faith leader. He was that most unlikely of heroes  an economist. His name was Simon Kuznets and the report that  he delivered was called  National Income           .  Now  you might think this is a rather dry and dull report. And you're absolutely right. It's dry as a bone. But this report is the foundation of how  today  we judge the  success of countries  what we know best as Gross Domestic Product  GDP. GDP has defined and shaped our lives for the last    years. And today I want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries  a different way to define  and shape our lives for the next    years. But first  we have to understand how GDP came to dominate our lives. Kuznets' report was delivered at a moment of crisis. The U.S. economy was plummeting into the Great Depression and policy makers were  struggling to respond. Struggling because they didn't know what was going on. They didn't have data and statistics. So what Kuznet's report gave them was reliable data on what  the U.S. economy was producing  updated year by year. And armed with this information  policy makers were  eventually  able to find a way out  of the slump. And because Kuznets' invention was found to be so useful  it spread around the world. And now today  every country produces GDP statistics. But  in that first report  Kuznets himself delivered a warning. It's in the introductory chapter. On page seven he says   The welfare of a nation can  therefore  scarcely be inferred from a measurement of  national income as defined above.  It's not the greatest sound  bite in the world  and it's dressed up in the cautious  language of the economist. But his message was clear  GDP is a tool to help us measure economic performance. It's not a measure of our well being. And it shouldn't be a guide  to all decision making. But we have ignored Kuznets' warning. We live in a world where GDP is the benchmark of success in a global economy. Our politicians boast when GDP goes up. Markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries  are going down  all measured in GDP. Our societies have become engines to create more GDP. But we know that GDP is flawed. It ignores the environment. It counts bombs and prisons as progress. It can't count happiness or community. And it has nothing to say  about fairness or justice. Is it any surprise that our world  marching to the drumbeat of GDP  is teetering on the brink of environmental disaster and filled with anger and conflict  We need a better way to measure our societies  a measure based on the real  things that matter to real people. Do I have enough to eat  Can I read and write  Am I safe  Do I have rights  Do I live in a society where I'm not discriminated against  Is my future and the future of my children  prevented from environmental destruction  These are questions that GDP does not and cannot answer. There have  of course  been efforts in the past to move beyond GDP. But I believe that we're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution. We're ready because we've seen  in the financial crisis of       how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray. We've seen  in the Arab Spring  how countries like Tunisia were supposedly economic superstars  but they were societies that were seething with discontentment. We're ready  because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets. Today  I'd like to introduce you  to the Social Progress Index. It's a measure of the  well being of society  completely separate from GDP. It's a whole new way of looking at the world. The Social Progress Index begins by defining what it means to be a good society based around three dimensions. The first is  does everyone have the basic needs for survival  food  water  shelter  safety  Secondly  does everyone have access to the building blocks  to improve their lives  education  information  health and sustainable environment  And then third  does every  individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from obstacles  Do they have rights  freedom of choice  freedom from discrimination and access to the the world's most advanced knowledge  Together  these    components form the Social Progress framework. And for each of these    components  we have indicators to measure  how countries are performing. Not indicators of effort or intention  but real achievement. We don't measure how much a country spends on healthcare  we measure the length and  quality of people's lives. We don't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination  we measure whether people  experience discrimination. But what you want to know is who's top  don't you   Laughter  I knew that  I knew that  I knew that. Okay  I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you on this chart. So here we are  what I've done here is put on the  vertical axis social progress. Higher is better. And then  just for comparison  just for fun  on the horizontal axis is GDP per capita. Further to the right is more. So the country in the world with the highest social progress  the number one country on social progress is New Zealand. Well done  Never been  must go. The country with the least social progress  I'm sorry to say  is Chad. I've never been  maybe next year. Or maybe the year after. Now  I know what you're thinking. You're thinking   Aha  but New Zealand has a higher GDP than Chad   It's a good point  well made. But let me show you two other countries. Here's the United States   considerably richer than New Zealand  but with a lower level of social progress. And then here's Senegal   it's got a higher level of  social progress than Chad  but the same level of GDP. So what's going on  Well  look. Let me bring in the rest of  the countries of the world  the     we've been able to measure  each one represented by a dot. There we go. Lots of dots. Now  obviously I can't do all of them  so a few highlights for you  The highest ranked G  country is Canada. My country  the United Kingdom  is sort of middling  sort of dull  but who cares   at least we beat the French. And then looking at the  emerging economies  top of the BRICS   pleased to say  is Brazil. Come on  cheer  Go  Brazil  Beating South Africa  then Russia  then China and then India. Tucked away on the right hand side  you will see a dot of a  country with a lot of GDP but not a huge amount  of social progress   that's Kuwait. Just above Brazil is a social progress superpower   that's Costa Rica. It's got a level of social progress the same  as some Western European countries  with a much lower GDP. Now  my slide is getting  a little cluttered and I'd like to step back a bit. So let me take away these countries  and then pop in the regression line. So this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress. The first thing to notice  is that there's lots of noise around the trend line. And what this shows  what this empirically demonstrates  is that GDP is not destiny. At every level of GDP per capita  there are opportunities for more social progress  risks of less. The second thing to notice is that for poor countries  the curve is really steep. So what this tells us is that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra GDP  and if they reinvest that in doctors  nurses  water supplies  sanitation  etc.  there's a lot of social progress bang for your GDP buck. And that's good news  and that's what  we've seen over the last        years  with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries. But go on a bit further up the curve  and then we see it flattening out. Each extra dollar of GDP is buying less and less social progress. And with more and more of the world's population living on this part of the curve  it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development. I'll show you an example of Brazil. Here's Brazil  social progress of about    out of      GDP per capita about         dollars a year. And look  Brazil's above the line. Brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning GDP into social progress. But where does Brazil go next  Let's say that Brazil adopts a bold economic plan to double GDP in the next decade. But that is only half a plan. It's less than half a plan  because where does Brazil want to go on social progress  Brazil  it's possible to increase your growth  increase your GDP  while stagnating or going backwards on social progress. We don't want Brazil to become like Russia. What you really want is for Brazil to get ever more efficient at creating  social progress from its GDP  so it becomes more like New Zealand. And what that means is that Brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it's not just growth alone  it's growth with social progress. And that's what the Social  Progress Index does  It reframes the debate about development  not just about GDP alone  but inclusive  sustainable growth that brings real improvements  in people's lives. And it's not just about countries. Earlier this year  with our friends from the Imazon  nonprofit here in Brazil  we launched the first subnational  Social Progress Index. We did it for the Amazon region. It's an area the size of  Europe     million people  one of the most deprived  parts of the country. And here are the results  and this is broken down into nearly     different municipalities. And with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country  Imazon and other partners from government   business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people's lives  while protecting that  precious global asset that is the Amazon Rainforest. And this is just the beginning  You can create a Social Progress Index for any state  region   city or municipality. We all know and love TEDx  this is Social Pogress x. This is a tool for anyone to come and use. Contrary to the way we  sometimes talk about it  GDP was not handed down from  God on tablets of stone.  Laughter  It's a measurement tool invented in the   th century to address the challenges of the   th century. In the   st century  we face new challenges  aging  obesity  climate change  and so on. To face those challenges  we need new tools of measurement  new ways of valuing progress. Imagine if we could measure what nonprofits  charities  volunteers  civil society organizations really contribute to our society. Imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution  but on their contribution  to social progress. Imagine if we could hold  politicians to account for really improving people's lives. Imagine if we could work together   government  business   civil society  me  you   and make this century the  century of social progress. Thank you. What has the War on Drugs  done to the world  Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico  Central America  so many  other parts of the planet  the global black market estimated at     billion dollars a year  prisons packed in the  United States and elsewhere  police and military drawn  into an unwinnable war that violates basic rights   and ordinary citizens just hope they don't get  caught in the crossfire  and meanwhile  more people using more drugs than ever. It's my country's history  with alcohol prohibition and Al Capone  times   . Which is why it's  particularly galling to me as an American that we've  been the driving force behind this global drug war. Ask why so many countries criminalize drugs they'd never heard of  why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize criminalization over health  even why most of the money worldwide for dealing with drug abuse goes not to helping agencies but those that punish  and you'll find the good old U.S. of A. Why did we do this  Some people  especially in Latin America  think it's not really about drugs. It's just a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the U.S. But by and large  that's not it. We don't want gangsters and guerrillas funded with illegal drug money terrorizing and taking over other nations. No  the fact is  America really is crazy when it comes to drugs. I mean  don't forget  we're  the ones who thought that we could prohibit alcohol. So think about our global drug war not as any sort of rational policy  but as the international projection of a domestic psychosis. But here's the good news. Now it's the Russians leading the Drug War and not us. Most politicians in my country want to roll back the Drug War now  put fewer people behind bars  not more  and I'm proud to say as an American that we now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies. It's now legal for medical purposes in almost half our    states  millions of people can  purchase their marijuana  their medicine  in government  licensed dispensaries  and over half my fellow  citizens now say it's time to legally regulate and tax marijuana more or less like alcohol. That's what Colorado and  Washington are doing  and Uruguay  and others  are sure to follow. So that's what I do  work to end the Drug War. I think it all started growing up in a fairly religious  moral family  eldest son of a rabbi  going off to university where I smoked some marijuana and I liked it.  Laughter  And I liked drinking too  but it was obvious that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two  but my friends and I could get busted for smoking a joint. Now  that hypocrisy kept bugging me  so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation on international drug control. I talked my way into the State Department. I got a security clearance. I interviewed hundreds of DEA and other law enforcement agents all around Europe and the Americas  and I'd ask them   What do you think the answer is   Well  in Latin America  they'd say to me   You can't really cut off the supply. The answer lies back in the U.S.  in cutting off the demand.  So then I go back home and I talk to people involved in anti drug efforts there  and they'd say   You know  Ethan  you can't  really cut off the demand. The answer lies over there. You've got to cut off the supply.  Then I'd go and talk  to the guys in customs trying to stop drugs at the borders  and they'd say   You're  not going to stop it here. The answer lies over there  in cutting off supply and demand.  And it hit me  Everybody involved in this thought the answer lay in that area about which they knew the least. So that's when I started  reading everything I could about psychoactive drugs   the history  the science  the politics  all of it  and the more one read  the more it hit you how a thoughtful  enlightened  intelligent  approach took you over here  whereas the politics and laws of my country were taking you over here. And that disparity struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle. There's probably never been a drug free society. Virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain  increase  our energy  socialize  even commune with God. Our desire to alter our consciousness may be as fundamental as our desires for food  companionship and sex. So our true challenge is to learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible harm and in some cases the  greatest possible benefit. I'll tell you something else I learned  that the reason some drugs  are legal and others not has almost nothing to do  with science or health or the relative risk of drugs  and almost everything to do with who uses and who is perceived  to use particular drugs. In the late   th century  when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal  the principal consumers  of opiates in my country and others were middle aged white women  using them to alleviate aches and pains when few other analgesics were available. And nobody thought about  criminalizing it back then because nobody wanted to  put Grandma behind bars. But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese started showing up in my country  working hard on the railroads and the mines and then kicking back in the evening just like they had in the old country with a few puffs on that opium pipe  that's when you saw the  first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada  driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium addicted sex slaves. The first cocaine prohibition  laws  similarly prompted by racist fears of black men  sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in Southern society. And the first marijuana prohibition laws  all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest. And what was true in my country  is true in so many others as well  with both the origins of these laws and their implementation. Put it this way  and I exaggerate only slightly  If the principal smokers of cocaine were affluent older white men and the principal consumers of Viagra were poor young black men  then smokable cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor and selling Viagra would get you  five to    years behind bars. I used to be a professor teaching about this. Now I'm an activist  a human rights activist  and what drives me is my shame at living in an otherwise great nation that has less than five percent of the world's population but almost    percent of the world's incarcerated population. It's the people I meet  who have lost someone they love to drug related  violence or prison or overdose or AIDS because our drug policies emphasize criminalization over health. It's good people who have lost their jobs  their homes  their freedom   even their children to the state  not because they hurt anyone but solely because they chose to use one drug instead of another. So is legalization the answer  On that  I'm torn  three days a week I think yes  three days a week I think no  and on Sundays I'm agnostic. But since today is Tuesday  let me just say that legally  regulating and taxing most of the drugs that  are now criminalized would radically reduce  the crime  violence  corruption and black markets  and the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs  and improve public safety  and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes. I mean  look  the markets  in marijuana  cocaine  heroin and methamphetamine are global commodities markets just like the global markets  in alcohol  tobacco  coffee  sugar  and so many other things. Where there is a demand  there will be a supply. Knock out one source and another inevitably emerges. People tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents  the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void. Which is why putting criminal laws and police front and center in trying to control a dynamic global commodities market is a recipe for disaster. And what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground and regulate them as  intelligently as we can to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies. Now  with marijuana  that obviously means legally regulating and  taxing it like alcohol. The benefits of doing so are enormous  the risks minimal. Will more people use marijuana  Maybe  but it's not  going to be young people  because it's not going to  be legalized for them  and quite frankly  they already have the best access to marijuana. I think it's going to be older people. It's going to be people in their   s and   s and   s who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with  their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a  long term marriage.  Laughter  And that just might be a  net public health benefit. As for the other drugs  look at Portugal  where  nobody goes to jail for possessing drugs  and the government's made  a serious commitment to treating addiction as a health issue. Look at Switzerland   Germany  the Netherlands  Denmark  England  where people who have been addicted to heroin for many years and repeatedly tried to quit and failed can get pharmaceutical  heroin and helping services in medical clinics  and  the results are in  Illegal drug abuse and disease and overdoses and crime  and arrests all go down  health and well being improve  taxpayers benefit  and many drug users even put their addictions behind them. Look at New Zealand  which  recently enacted a law allowing certain recreational  drugs to be sold legally provided their safety had been established. Look here in Brazil  and some other countries  where a remarkable psychoactive substance  ayahuasca  can be legally  bought and consumed provided it's done so  within a religious context. Look in Bolivia and Peru  where all sorts of products  made from the coca leaf  the source of cocaine  are sold legally over the counter with no apparent harm to people's public health. I mean  don't forget  Coca Cola had cocaine in it until       and so far as we know was no more addictive than Coca Cola is today. Conversely  think about cigarettes  Nothing can both hook you  and kill you like cigarettes. When researchers ask heroin addicts what's the toughest drug to  quit  most say cigarettes. Yet in my country and many others  half of all the people who  were ever addicted to cigarettes have quit without anyone being  arrested or put in jail or sent to a  treatment program  by a prosecutor or a judge. What did it were higher taxes and time and place  restrictions on sale and use and effective anti smoking campaigns. Now  could we reduce smoking even more by making it totally illegal  Probably. But just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result. So the challenges we face today are twofold. The first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies  even as we need to get  better at regulating and living with the drugs  that are now legal. But the second challenge is tougher  because it's about us. The obstacles to reform  lie not just out there in the power of the  prison industrial complex or other vested interests  that want to keep things the way they are  but within each and every one of us. It's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands  in the way of real reform. And ultimately  I think that  boils down to the kids  and to every parent's desire to put our baby in a bubble  and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk. In fact  sometimes it  seems like the entire War on Drugs gets justified as one great big child protection act  which any young person  can tell you it's not. So here's what I say to teenagers. First  don't do drugs. Second  don't do drugs. Third  if you do do drugs  there's some things I want you to know  because my bottom line as your parent is  come home safely at the end of the night and grow up and lead a  healthy and good adulthood. That's my drug education  mantra  Safety first. So this is what I've dedicated my life to  to building an organization and a movement of people who believe we  need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug  policies grounded in science  compassion  health and human rights  where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well  where people who love our drugs  people who hate drugs  and people who don't give  a damn about drugs  but every one of us believes  that this War on Drugs  this backward  heartless   disastrous War on Drugs  has got to end. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Ethan  congrats   quite the reaction. That was a powerful talk. Not quite a complete standing O  though  and I'm guessing that some people here and maybe a few watching online  maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend or whatever who got sick  maybe died from some drug overdose. I'm sure you've had these people approach you before. What do you say to them  Ethan Nadelmann  Chris  the most amazing thing that's happened of late is that I've met a growing number of people who have actually  lost a sibling or a child to a drug overdose  and    years ago  those  people just wanted to say  let's line up all the drug  dealers and shoot them and that will solve it. And what they've come to understand is that the Drug War did  nothing to protect their kids. If anything  it made it more likely that those kids were put at risk. And so they're now becoming part of this drug policy reform movement. There's other people who have kids  one's addicted to alcohol  the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin  and they ask themselves the question  Why does this kid get to  take one step at a time and try to get better and that one's got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time  So everybody's understanding  the Drug War's not protecting anybody. CA  Certainly in the U.S.   you've got political gridlock on most issues. Is there any realistic chance of anything actually shifting on this  issue in the next five years  EN  I'd say it's quite remarkable.  I'm getting all these calls from journalists now who are saying to me   Ethan  it seems like the only two issues advancing politically in America right now are marijuana law reform and gay marriage. What are you doing right   And then you're looking at  bipartisanship breaking out with  actually  Republicans in the Congress and state legislatures  allowing bills to be enacted with majority Democratic support  so we've gone from being sort of the third rail  the most fearful issue of American politics  to becoming one of the most successful. CA  Ethan  thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal. EN  Chris  thanks so much. CA  Thank you. EN  Thank you.  Applause  They told me that I'm a traitor to my own profession  that I should be fired  have my medical license taken away  that I should go back to my own country. My email got hacked. In a discussion forum for other doctors  someone took credit for  Twitter bombing  my account. Now  I didn't know if this was a good or bad thing  but then came the response   Too bad it wasn't a real bomb.  I never thought that I would do something that would provoke this level of anger among other doctors. Becoming a doctor was my dream. I grew up in China  and my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital because I had such bad asthma that I was there nearly every week. I had this one doctor  Dr. Sam  who always took care of me. She was about the same age as my mother. She had this wild  curly hair  and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses. She was one of those doctors who  if you fell and you broke your arm  she would ask you why you weren't laughing because it's your humerus. Get it  See  you'd groan  but she'd always make you feel better after having seen her. Well  we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like  right  Well  I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam. When I was eight  my parents and I moved to the U.S.  and ours became the typical immigrant narrative. My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas so that I could pursue my dream. Well  eventually I learned enough English  and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service. But then one day  everything changed. My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well  she had a cough that wouldn't go away  she was short of breath and tired. Well  I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything. For her to tell me that something was the matter  I knew something had to be really wrong. And it was  We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer  cancer that by then had spread to her lungs  her bones  and her brain. My mother was brave  though  and she had hope. She went through surgery and radiation  and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book. She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet and she found it  but she found something else too. On several websites  he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company  and in fact often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her. She called me in a panic  and I didn't know what to believe. Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her  but maybe it wasn't. It made her scared and it made her doubt. When it comes to medicine  having that trust is a must  and when that trust is gone  then all that's left is fear. There's another side to this fear. As a medical student  I was taking care of this    year old who was biking back to his dorm when he got struck and hit  run over by an SUV. He had seven broken ribs  shattered hip bones  and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain. Now  imagine being his parents who flew in from Seattle        miles away  to find their son in a coma. I mean  you'd want to find out what's going on with him  right  They asked to attend our bedside rounds where we discussed his condition and his plan  which I thought was a reasonable request  and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared. The head doctor  though  said no. He gave all kinds of reasons. Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way. Maybe they'll stop students from asking questions. He even said   What if they see mistakes and sue us   What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear  and what I learned was that to become a doctor  we have to put on our white coats  put up a wall  and hide behind it. There's a hidden epidemic in medicine. Of course  patients are scared when they come to the doctor. Imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache  you go to the hospital  you're lying in this strange place  you're on this hospital gurney  you're wearing this flimsy gown  strangers are coming to poke and prod at you. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't even know if you're going to get the blanket you asked for    minutes ago. But it's not just patients who are scared  doctors are scared too. We're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about. And so what do we do  We put on our white coats and we hide behind them. Of course  the more we hide  the more people want to know what it is that we're hiding. The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care. We don't just have a fear of sickness  we have a sickness of fear. Can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do  Can we overcome the sickness of fear  Let me ask you differently  If hiding isn't the answer  what if we did the opposite  What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients  Last fall  I conducted a research study to find out what it is that people want to know about their healthcare. I didn't just want to study patients in a hospital  but everyday people. So my two medical students  Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns  literally took their research to the streets. They went to banks  coffee shops  senior centers  Chinese restaurants and train stations. What did they find  Well  when we asked people   What do you want to know about your healthcare   people responded with what they want to know about their doctors  because people understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors. When we asked   What do you want to know about your doctors   people gave three different answers. Some want to know that their doctor is competent and certified to practice medicine. Some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science  not on who pays them. Surprisingly to us  many people want to know something else about their doctors. Jonathan  a    year old law student  says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients and specializes in LGBT health. Serena  a    year old accountant  says that it's important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women's rights. Frank  a    year old hardware store owner  doesn't even like going to the doctor and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first  but who is comfortable with alternative treatments. One after another  our respondents told us that that doctor patient relationship is a deeply intimate one   that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets  they want to first understand their doctor's values. Just because doctors have to see every patient doesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor. People want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice. As a result of this  I formed a campaign  Who's My Doctor  that calls for total transparency in medicine. Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in  but also our conflicts of interest. We go beyond the Government in the Sunshine Act about drug company affiliations  and we talk about how we're paid. Incentives matter. If you go to your doctor because of back pain  you might want to know he's getting paid       dollars to perform spine surgery versus    dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist  or if he's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends. Then  we go one step further. We add our values when it comes to women's health  LGBT health  alternative medicine  preventive health  and end of life decisions. We pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you  so you have a right to know who we are. We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear. I thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn't  but I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue. Within one week of starting Who's My Doctor  Medscape's public forum and several online doctors' communities had thousands of posts about this topic. Here are a few. From a gastroenterologist in Portland   I devoted    years of my life to being a slave. I have loans and mortgages. I depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients.  Well  times may be hard for everyone  but try telling your patient making        dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch. From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte   I find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from. My patients don't disclose their incomes to me.  But your patients' sources of income don't affect your health. From a psychiatrist in New York City   Pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs  what model of car we drive  and what toilet paper we use.  Well  how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle won't affect your patients' health  but your views on a woman's right to choose and preventive medicine and end of life decisions just might. And my favorite  from a Kansas City cardiologist   More government mandated stuff  Dr. Wen needs to move back to her own country.  Well  two pieces of good news. First of all  this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory  and second of all  I'm American and I'm already here. Within a month  my employers were getting calls asking for me to be fired. I received mail at my undisclosed home address with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me. My friends and family urged me to quit this campaign. After the bomb threat  I was done. But then I heard from patients. Over social media  a TweetChat  which I'd learned what that was by then  generated  .  million impressions  and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue. They wrote with things like   If doctors are doing something they're that ashamed of  they shouldn't be doing it.   Elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions. Lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests. Why shouldn't doctors   And finally  many people wrote and said   Let us patients decide what's important when we're choosing a doctor.  In our initial trial  over     doctors have taken the total transparency pledge. What a crazy new idea  right  But actually  this is not that new of a concept at all. Remember Dr. Sam  my doctor in China  with the goofy jokes and the wild hair  Well  she was my doctor  but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street. I went to the same school as her daughter. My parents and I trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for  and she had no need to hide from us. Just one generation ago  this was the norm in the U.S. as well. You knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys  that he quit smoking a few years ago  that he says he's a regular churchgoer  but you see him twice a year  once at Easter and once when his mother in law comes to town. You knew what he was about  and he had no need to hide from you. But the sickness of fear has taken over  and patients suffer the consequences. I know this firsthand. My mother fought her cancer for eight years. She was a planner  and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die. Not only did she sign advance directives  she wrote a    page document about how she had suffered enough  how it was time for her to go. One day  when I was a resident physician  I got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit. By the time I got there  she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing machine.  But this is not what she wants   I said   and we have documents.  The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye  pointed at my then    year old sister  and said   Do you remember when you were that age  How would you have liked to grow up without your mother   Her oncologist was there too  and said   This is your mother. Can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don't do everything for her   I knew my mother so well. I understood what her directives meant so well  but I was a physician. That was the single hardest decision I ever made  to let her die in peace  and I carry those words of those doctors with me every single day. We can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do and what patients need. We can get there  because we've been there before  and we know that transparency gets us to that trust. Research has shown us that openness also helps doctors  that having open medical records  being willing to talk about medical errors  will increase patient trust  improve health outcomes  and reduce malpractice. That openness  that trust  is only going to be more important as we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease. Bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy  but for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices  to address issues like smoking cessation  blood pressure management and diabetes control  well  that requires us to establish trust. Here's what other transparent doctors have said. Brandon Combs  an internist in Denver   This has brought me closer to my patients. The type of relationship I've developed   that's why I entered medicine.  Aaron Stupple  an internist in Denver   I tell my patients that I am totally open with them. I don't hide anything from them. This is me. Now tell me about you. We're in this together.  May Nguyen  a family physician in Houston   My colleagues are astounded by what I'm doing. They ask me how I could be so brave. I said  I'm not being brave  it's my job.  I leave you today with a final thought. Being totally transparent is scary. You feel naked  exposed and vulnerable  but that vulnerability  that humility  it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine. When doctors are willing to step off our pedestals  take off our white coats  and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about  that's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear. That's when we establish trust. That's when we change the paradigm of medicine from one of secrecy and hiding to one that is fully open and engaged for our patients. Thank you. Vincent Moon  How can we use computers  cameras  microphones to represent the world in an alternative way  as much as possible  How  maybe  is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema  And actually  why do we record  Well  it is with such simple questions in mind that I started to make films    years ago  first with a friend  Christophe Abric. He had a website  La Blogoth que  dedicated to independent music. We were crazy about music. We wanted to represent  music in a different way  to film the music we love  the musicians we admired  as much as possible  far  from the music industry and far from the cliches attached to it. We started to publish every week sessions on the Internet. We are going to see a few extracts now. From Grizzly Bear in the shower to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe. From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower to Tom Jones in his  hotel room in New York. From Arcade Fire in an elevator in the Olympia to Beirut going down a staircase in Brooklyn. From R.E.M. in a car to The National around a table at night in the south of France. From Bon Iver playing with some friends in an apartment in Montmartre to Yeasayer having a long night  and many  many  many more unknown or very famous bands. We published all those films for free on the Internet  and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way. We wanted to create  another type of intimacy using all those new technologies. At the time     years ago actually  there was no such project on the Internet  and I guess that's why the project we  were making  the Take Away Shows  got quite successful  reaching millions of viewers. After a while  I got a bit   I wanted to go somewhere else. I felt the need to travel and to discover some other music  to explore the world  going to other corners  and actually it was also this idea of nomadic cinema  sort of  that I had in mind. How could the use of new technologies  and the road fit together  How could I edit my films in a bus crossing the Andes  So I went on five year travels around the globe. I started at the time in the digital film  and music label collection Petites Plan tes  which was also an homage to French filmmaker Chris Marker. We're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films. From the tecno brega diva of northern Brazil  Gaby Amarantos to a female ensemble in Chechnya. From experimental electronic music  in Singapore with One Man Nation to Brazilian icon Tom Z  singing on his rooftop in S o Paolo. From The Bambir  the great  rock band from Armenia to some traditional songs in a restaurant in Tbilisi  Georgia. From White Shoes  a great retro  pop band from Jakarta  Indonesia to DakhaBrakha  the revolutionary  band from Kiev  Ukraine. From Tomi Lebrero and his bandoneon and his friends in Buenos Aires  Argentina  to many other places and musicians around the world. My desire was to make it as a trek. To do all those films  it would have been impossible with a big company behind me  with a structure or anything. I was traveling alone with a backpack   computer  camera  microphones in it. Alone  actually  but  just with local people  meeting my team  which was absolutely not professional people  on the spot there  going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek. I really believed that cinema could be this very simple thing  I want to make a film and you're going  to give me a place to stay for the night. I give you a moment of cinema and you offer me a capirinha. Well  or other drinks  depending on where you are. In Peru  they drink pisco sour. Well  when I arrived in Peru  actually  I had no idea about what I would do there. And I just had one phone number  actually  of one person. Three months later  after traveling all around the  country  I had recorded    films  only with the help of local people  only with the help of people that I was asking all the  time the same question  What is important to record here today  By living in such a way  by working without any structure  I was able to react to the moment and to decide  oh  this is  important to make now. This is important to  record that whole person. This is important to create this exchange. When I went to Chechnya  the first person I met looked at me and was like   What are you doing here  Are you a journalist  NGO  Politics  What kind of problems  are you going to study   Well  I was there to research on Sufi rituals in Chechnya  actually   incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya  which is absolutely unknown  outside of the region. As soon as people understood that I would give them those films   I would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license  but I would also really  give them to the people and I would let them do  what they want with it. I just want to represent  them in a beautiful light. I just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather  and they're going to be like   Whoa  my grandfather is as  cool as Beyonc .   Laughter  It's a really important thing. It's really important  because that's the way people are going to look differently at  their own culture  at their own land. They're going to think about it differently. It may be a way to maintain  a certain diversity. Why you will record  Hmm. There's a really good quote by American thinker Hakim Bey which says   Every recording is a tombstone of a live performance.  It's a really good  sentence to keep in mind nowadays in an era saturated by images. What's the point of that  Where do we go with it  I was researching. I was still  keeping this idea in mind  What's the point  I was researching on music  trying to pull  trying to get closer to a certain origin of it. Where is this all coming from  I am French. I had no idea about what I would discover   which is a very simple thing  Everything was sacred  at first  and music was spiritual healing. How could I use my camera  my little tool  to get closer and maybe not only capture the trance but find an equivalent   a cine trance  maybe  something in complete harmony with the people  That is now my new research I'm doing on spirituality  on new  spirits around the world. Maybe a few more extracts now. From the Tana Toraja  funeral ritual in Indonesia to an Easter ceremony  in the north of Ethiopia. From jathilan  a popular trance ritual on the island of Java  to Umbanda in the north of Brazil. The Sufi rituals of Chechnya to a mass in the holiest  church of Armenia. Some Sufi songs in Harar  the holy city of Ethiopia  to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the Amazon of  Peru with the Shipibo. Then to my new project   the one I'm doing now here in Brazil  named  H bridos.  I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon. It's research on the new  spiritualities all around the country. This is my quest  my own little quest  of what I call experimental ethnography  trying to hybrid all  those different genres  trying to regain a certain complexity. Why do we record  I was still there. I really believe cinema teaches us to see. The way we show the world is going to change the  way we see this world  and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible  terrible job at representing the world  violence  extremists  only spectacular events  only simplifications of everyday life. I think we are recording to regain a certain complexity. To reinvent life today  we have to make new forms of images. And it's very simple. Muito obrigado. Bruno Giussani  Vincent  Vincent  Vincent. Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance  and I have a question for you  and the question is this  You show up in places like the  ones you just have shown us  and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome. You walk into sacred rituals  private moments in a village  a town  a group of people. How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens  VM  I think you break it with your body  more than with your knowledge. That's what it taught me to travel  to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain. The respect is stepping forward  not stepping backward  and I really think that by engaging your body in the moment  in the ceremony  in the places  people welcome you and understand your energy. BG  You told me that most of the videos you have made are  actually one single shot. You don't do much editing. I mean  you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length  etc. Otherwise  you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning  and so is that the case  It's correct  VM  My idea is that I think that as long as we don't cut  in a way  as long as we let the viewer watch  more and more viewers  are going to feel closer  are going to get closer to the moment  to that moment and to that place. I really think of that as a matter  of respecting the viewer  to not cut all the time from one place to another  to just let the time go. BG  Tell me in a few words  about your new project   H bridos   here in Brazil. Just before coming to  TEDGlobal  you have actually been traveling around  the country for that. Tell us a couple of things. VM   H bridos  is    I really believe Brazil  far from the cliches  is the greatest religious country in the world  the greatest country  in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities. And it's a big project I'm  doing over this year  which is researching in very different regions of Brazil  in very different forms of cults  and trying to understand  how people live together with spirituality nowadays. BG  The man who is going to  appear onstage momentarily  and Vincent's going to introduce him  is one of the subjects of  one of his past videos. When did you do a video with him  VM  I guess four years ago  four years in my first travel. BG  So it was one of  your first ones in Brazil. VM  It was amongst the  first ones in Brazil  yeah. I shot the film in Recife  in the place where he is from. BG  So let's introduce him.  Who are we waiting for  VM  I'll just make it very short. It's a very great honor for  me to welcome onstage one of the greatest Brazilian  musicians of all time. Please welcome Nan  Vasconcelos. BG  Nan  Vasconcelos  Nan  Vasconcelos  Let's go to the jungle. Picture this  It's Monday morning  you're at the office  you're settling in for the day at work  and this guy that you sort of  recognize from down the hall  walks right into your cubicle and he steals your chair. Doesn't say a word   just rolls away with it. Doesn't give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs  that are out there. Doesn't acknowledge the fact  that you might need your chair to get some work done today. You wouldn't stand for  it. You'd make a stink. You'd follow that guy back to his cubicle and you'd say   Why my chair   Okay  so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office  and a meeting invitation pops  up in your calendar. And it's from this woman who you  kind of know from down the hall  and the subject line references some  project that you heard a little bit about. But there's no agenda. There's no information about why you were invited to the meeting. And yet you accept the  meeting invitation  and you go. And when this highly  unproductive session is over  you go back to your desk  and you stand at your  desk and you say   Boy  I wish I had those two hours back  like I wish I had my chair back.  Every day  we allow our coworkers  who are otherwise very   very nice people  to steal from us. And I'm talking about something far  more valuable than office furniture. I'm talking about time. Your time. In fact  I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS  Mindless Accept Syndrome. The primary symptom of  Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar. It's an involuntary reflex   ding   click  bing   it's in your calendar   Gotta go  I'm already late  for a meeting.   Laughter  Meetings are important  right  And collaboration is key to  the success of any enterprise. And a well run meeting can yield  really positive  actionable results. But between globalization and pervasive information technology  the way that we work has really changed dramatically  over the last few years. And we're miserable.  Laughter  And we're miserable not because the  other guy can't run a good meeting  it's because of MAS  our  Mindless Accept Syndrome  which is a self inflicted wound. Actually  I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic. Let me tell you why. A couple of years ago  I put a video  on Youtube  and in the video  I acted out every terrible  conference call you've ever been on. It goes on for about five minutes  and it has all the things that we  hate about really bad meetings. There's the moderator who has  no idea how to run the meeting. There are the participants who  have no idea why they're there. The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck. And everybody leaves very angry. It's kind of funny. Let's take a quick look. As a group  we need to decide if   bloop bloop   Hi  who just joined  Hi  it's Joe. I'm working from home today. Hi  Joe. Thanks for  joining us today  great. I was just saying  we have a lot of people  on the call we'd like to get through  so let's skip the roll call and I'm gonna dive right in. Our goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal. As a group  we need to decide if   bloop bloop   Hi  who just joined  No  I thought I heard a beep.  Laughter  Sound familiar  Yeah  it sounds familiar  to me  too. A couple of weeks after I put that online          people in dozens of countries  I mean dozens of countries  watched this video. And three years later  it's still getting  thousands of views every month. It's close to about a million right now. And in fact  some of the biggest companies in the world  companies that you've  heard of but I won't name  have asked for my permission to use  this video in their new hire training to teach their new employees how  not to run a meeting at their company. And if the numbers   there are a million views and it's being used by all these companies   aren't enough proof that we have  a global problem with meetings  there are the many  many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up. Thousands of people wrote things like   OMG  that was my day today    That was my day every day    This is my life.  One guy wrote   It's funny because it's true. Eerily  sadly  depressingly true. It made me laugh until I cried. And cried. And I cried some more.  This poor guy said   My daily life until  retirement or death  sigh.  These are real quotes and it's real sad. A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief  that we are powerless to do anything other  than go to meetings and suffer through these  poorly run meetings and live to meet another day. But the truth is  we're  not powerless at all. In fact  the cure for MAS is right here in our hands. It's right at our fingertips  literally. It's something that I call  No MAS  Which  if I remember my  high school Spanish  means something like    Enough already  make it stop   Here's how No MAS  works. It's very simple. First of all  the next time you  get a meeting invitation that doesn't have a lot  of information in it at all  click the tentative button  It's okay  you're allowed   that's why it's there. It's right next to the accept button. Or the maybe button  or whatever button  is there for you not to accept immediately. Then  get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting. Tell them you're very excited  to support their work  ask them what the goal  of the meeting is  and tell them you're interested in learning  how you can help them achieve their goal. And if we do this often enough  and we do it respectfully  people might start to be  a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations. And you can make more thoughtful  decisions about accepting it. People might actually start  sending out agendas. Imagine  Or they might not have a conference call with    people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with. People just might start to change their  behavior because you changed yours. And they just might bring your chair back  too.  Laughter  No MAS  Thank you. The Earth needs no introduction. It needs no introduction in part  because the Apollo    astronauts  when they were hurtling  around the moon in       took this iconic image. It galvanized a whole  generation of human beings to realize that we're on  Spaceship Earth  fragile and finite as it is  and that we need  to take care of it. But while this picture is beautiful  it's static  and the Earth is constantly changing. It's changing on days' time scales with human activity. And the satellite imagery we  have of it today is old. Typically  years old. And that's important because you can't fix what you can't see. What we'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day. So  what's standing in our way  What's the problem  This is the problem  Satellites are big  expensive  and they're slow. This one weighs three tons. It's six meters tall  four meters wide. It took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it. One satellite  one rocket. It cost     million dollars. Satellites like these have  done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet. But if we want to understand  it much more regularly  we need lots of satellites  and this model isn't scalable. So me and my friends   we started Planet Labs to make satellites ultra compact and small and highly capable. I'm going to show you what  our satellite looks like  This is our satellite. This is not a scale model  this is the real size. It's    by    by    centimeters  it weighs four kilograms  and we've stuffed the latest  and greatest electronics and sensor systems into  this little package so that even though this is really small  this can take pictures    times the resolution of the big satellite here  even though it weighs one  thousandth of the mass. And we call this satellite   Dove    Thank you. We call this satellite  Dove   and we call it  Dove  because  satellites are typically named after birds  but normally birds of prey  like Eagle  Hawk  Swoop   Kill  I don't know  Kestrel  these sort of things. But ours have a  humanitarian mission  so we wanted to call them Doves. And we haven't just  built them  though. We've launched them. And not just one  but many. It all started in our garage. Yes  we built our first satellite prototype in our garage. Now  this is pretty normal for a Silicon Valley company that we are  but we believe it's the first time  for a space company. And that's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley. We rapidly prototype our satellites. We use  release early   release often  on our software. And we take a different  risk approach. We take them outside and test them. We even put satellites in space just to test the satellites  and we've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale. We've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them  I think for the first time. We call it agile aerospace  and that's what's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box. Now  what has bonded  our team over the years is the idea of democratizing access to satellite information. In fact  the founders of our  company  Chris  Robbie and I  we met over    years ago  at the United Nations when they were hosting a conference  about exactly that question  How do you use satellites  to help humanity  How do you use satellites to help  people in developing countries or with climate change  And this is what has bonded us. Our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity. You could say  we're space geeks  but not only do we care  about what's up there  we care about what's down here  too. I'm going to show you a video from just four weeks ago  of two of our satellites being launched from the International Space Station. This is not an animation  this is a video taken by the astronaut  looking out of the window. It gives you a bit of a sense of  scale of our two satellites. It's like some of the  smallest satellites ever are being launched from  the biggest satellite ever. And right at the end  the solar array glints in the sun. It's really cool. Wait for it. Boom  Yeah. It's the money shot. So we didn't just launch  two of them like this  we launched    of them. It's the largest constellation of Earth imaging satellites in human history  and it's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet. But that's just the beginning. You see  we're going to launch more than     of these satellites like these over the  course of the next year. It's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history. And this is what it's going to do  Acting in a single orbit plane that  stays fixed with respect to the sun  the Earth rotates underneath. They're all cameras pointed down  and they slowly scan across as  the Earth rotates underneath. The Earth rotates every    hours  so we scan every point on the  planet every    hours. It's a line scanner for the planet. We don't take a picture of  anywhere on the planet every day  we take a picture of every single place on the planet every day. Even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago  we've already got some initial imagery from the satellites and I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now. This is the very first picture taken by our satellite. It happened to be over  UC Davis' campus in California when we  turned the camera on. But what's even cooler is when we compare it to the previous latest image of that area  which was taken many months ago. And the image on the left  is from our satellite  and we see buildings are being built. The general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities  every day. Water as well. Thank you. We'll be able to see  the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water security. From water security  to food security. We'll see crops as they  grow in all the fields in every farmer's field around the planet every day. and help them to improve crop yield. This is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago when the  satellite was flying over Argentina. The general point is there are probably hundreds and  thousands of applications of this data  I've mentioned a few  but there's others  deforestation  the ice caps melting. We can track all of these things  every tree on the planet every day. If you took the difference between today's image and yesterday's image  you'd see much of the world news   you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes. And we have decided  therefore  that the  best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it. We want to ensure everyone can see it. Thank you.  Applause  We want to empower NGOs and  companies and scientists and journalists to be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet. We want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data. In short  we want to democratize access to information about our planet. Which brings me back to this. You see  this will be an entirely new global data set. And we believe that together  we can help to take care  of our Spaceship Earth. And what I would like to leave you with is the following question  If you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day  what would you do with that data  What problems would you solve  What exploration would you do  Well  I invite you to come and explore with us. Thank you very much. Well  good afternoon. How many of you took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge  Woo hoo  Well  I have to tell you  from  the bottom of our hearts  thank you so very  very much. Do you know to date the ALS Association has raised     million dollars  Woo hoo   Applause  It takes me back to the summer of     . My family  my kids had all grown up. We were officially empty nesters  and we decided  let's  go on a family vacation. Jenn  my daughter  and my son in law came down from New York. My youngest  Andrew  he came down from his home in Charlestown where he was working in Boston  and my son Pete  who had played at  Boston College  baseball  had played baseball  professionally in Europe  and had now come home and was selling group insurance  he also joined us. And one night  I found myself having a beer with Pete  and Pete was looking at  me and he just said   You know  Mom  I don't know  selling group insurance  is just not my passion.  He said   I just don't feel  I'm living up to my potential. I don't feel this is my mission in life.  And he said   You know   oh by the way  Mom  I have to leave early from vacation because my inter city league team  that I play for made the playoffs  and I have to get back to Boston  because I can't let my team down. I'm just not as passionate about my job as I am about baseball.  So off Pete went  and  left the family vacation   break a mother's heart   and he went  and we  followed four days later to see the next playoff game. We're at the playoff game   Pete's at the plate  and a fastball's coming in  and it hits him on the wrist. Oh  Pete. His wrist went completely limp  like this. So for the next six months  Pete went back to his home in Southie  kept working that unpassionate job  and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back. Six months later  in March  he called my husband  and me  and he said   Oh  Mom and Dad  we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist. Do you want to come with the doctor's appointment with me   I said   Sure  we'll come in.  That morning  Pete  John and I all got up  got dressed  got in our cars   three separate cars because we were going to go to work after the doctor's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist. We walked into the  neurologist's office  sat down  four doctors walk in  and the head neurologist sits down. And he says   Well  Pete  we've been looking at all the tests  and I have to tell you   it's not a sprained wrist  it's not a broken wrist  it's not nerve damage in the wrist  it's not an infection  it's not Lyme disease.  And there was this deliberate  elimination going up  and I was thinking to myself  where is he going with this  Then he put his hands on his knees  he looked right at my     year old kid  and said   I don't know how to  tell a    year old this  Pete  you have ALS.  ALS  I had had a friend whose     year old father had ALS. I looked at my husband  he looked at me  and then we looked at the  doctor  and we said   ALS  Okay  what treatment  Let's go. What do we do  Let's go.  And he looked at us  and he said   Mr. and Mrs. Frates  I'm sorry to tell you this  but there's no treatment  and there's no cure.  We were the worst culprits. We didn't even understand that it had been    years since Lou Gehrig and nothing had been done  in the progress against ALS. So we all went home  and Jenn and Dan flew home from Wall Street  Andrew came home from Charlestown  and Pete went to B.C. to pick up his then girlfriend Julie  and brought her home  and six hours later after diagnosis  we're sitting around  having a family dinner  and we're having small chat. I don't even remember  cooking dinner that night. But then our leader  Pete  set the vision  and talked to us just like  we were his new team. He said   There will be  no wallowing  people.  He goes   We're not looking back  we're looking forward. What an amazing opportunity  we have to change the world. I'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of ALS. We're going to move the needle  and I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates.  And that was it. We  were given our directive. So in the days and months that followed  within a week  we had  our brothers and sisters and our family come to us  that they were already  creating Team Frate Train. Uncle Dave  he was the webmaster  Uncle Artie  he was the accountant  Auntie Dana  she was the graphic artist  and my youngest son  Andrew  quit his job  left his  apartment in Charlestown and says   I'm going to take care  of Pete and be his caregiver.  Then all those people   classmates  teammates  coworkers that Pete had inspired throughout his whole life  the circles of Pete all started intersecting with one another  and made Team Frate Train. Six months after diagnosis  Pete was given an award at a  research summit for advocacy. He got up and gave a very eloquent speech  and at the end of the  speech  there was a panel  and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and I'm sitting there and  I'm listening to them and most of the content  went straight over my head. I avoided every science  class I ever could. But I was watching these people  and I was listening to them  and they were saying    I  I do this  I do that   and there was a real  unfamiliarity between them. So at the end of their talk  the panel  they had questions and answers  and boom  my hand went right up  and I get the microphone  and I look at them and I say   Thank you. Thank you so much for working in ALS. It means so very much to us.  I said   But I do have to tell you that I'm watching your body language and I'm listening to what you're saying. It just doesn't seem like there's a whole  lot of collaboration going on here. And not only that  where's the flip chart with the action items and the  follow up and the accountability  What are you going to do  after you leave this room   And then I turned around and there was about     pairs  of eyes just staring at me. And it was that point that I realized that I had talked about  the elephant in the room. Thus my mission had begun. So over the next couple of years  Pete   we've had our highs and our lows. Pete was put on a compassionate use drug. It was hope in a bottle for  the whole ALS community. It was in a phase III trial. Then six months later  the  data comes back  no efficacy. We were supposed to  have therapies overseas  and the rug was  pulled out from under us. So for the next two years  we just watched my son  be taken away from me  little by little every day. Two and a half years ago  Pete was hitting home  runs at baseball fields. Today  Pete's completely paralyzed. He can't hold his head up any longer. He's confined to a motorized wheelchair. He can no longer swallow or eat. He has a feeding tube. He can't speak. He talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device  and we're watching his lungs  because his diaphragm  eventually is going to give out and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not. ALS robs the human of all their physical  parts  but the brain stays intact. So July  th          th year of Lou Gehrig's  inspirational speech comes  and Pete is asked by MLB.com to write an article in the Bleacher Report. And it was very significant  because he  wrote it using his eye gaze technology. Twenty days later   the ice started to fall. On July   th  Pete's  roommate in New York City  wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt  signifying Pat Quinn  another  ALS patient known in New York  and B.C. shorts said   I'm taking the ALS  Ice Bucket Challenge   picked up the ice  put it over his head.  And I'm nominating ...   And he sent it up to Boston. And that was on July   th. Over the next couple  of days  our news feed was full of family and friends. If you haven't gone back  the nice thing about Facebook is that you have the dates  you can go back. You've got to see Uncle Artie's  human Bloody Mary. I'm telling you  it's one of the best ones  and that was probably in day two. By about day four  Uncle  Dave  the webmaster  he isn't on Facebook  and I get a text from him   and it says   Nancy  what the hell is going on   Uncle Dave gets a hit  every time Pete's website is gone onto  and his  phone was blowing up. So we all sat down and we realized  money is coming in   how amazing. So we knew awareness  would lead to funding  we just didn't know it would only take a couple of days. So we got together  put our best      c    s on Pete's website  and off we went. So week one  Boston media. Week two  national media. It was during week two  that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor  saying   I think you people might  need food in there.  Week three  celebrities    Entertainment Tonight  Access Hollywood. Week four  global   BBC  Irish Radio. Did anyone see  Lost In Translation   My husband did Japanese television. It was interesting. And those videos  the popular ones. Paul Bissonnette's  glacier video  incredible. How about the redemption nuns of Dublin  Who's seen that one  It's absolutely fantastic. J.T.  Justin Timberlake. That's when we knew  that  was a real A list celebrity. I go back on my texts  and I can see  JT  JT   My sister texting me. Angela Merkel  the chancellor of Germany. Incredible. And the ALS patients  you know what their favorite ones are  and their families'  All of them. Because this misunderstood and  underfunded  rare  disease  they just sat and watched people  saying it over and over   ALS  ALS.  It was unbelievable. And those naysayers  let's just talk a couple  of stats  shall we  Okay  so the ALS Association  they think by year end  it'll be     million dollars. ALS TDI in Cambridge  they raised three million dollars. Well  guess what  They had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing. It was on a three year track for funding. Two months. It's coming out starting in two months. And YouTube has reported that over     countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS. And Facebook   .  million videos  and I had the awesome adventure visiting the Facebook campus last week  and I said to them   I know what it was like in my house. I can't imagine what it  was like around here.  All she said was   Jaw dropping.  And my family's favorite video  Bill Gates. Because the night Pete was diagnosed  he told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates  and he did it. Goal number one  check. Now on to the treatment and cure. So okay  after all of this ice  we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of  ice water over your head  and I really would like to leave you with a couple of things that  I'd like you to remember. The first thing is  every morning when you wake up  you can choose to live your day in positivity. Would any of you blame me if I just was in the fetal position and pulled the covers  over my head every day  No  I don't think anybody would blame me  but Pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be  positive and proactive. I actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals  that's why they got ALS  and I was like   I don't think so   but I had to get away from the negativity. The second thing I want to leave you with is the person at the  middle of the challenge has to be willing to have  the mental toughness to put themselves out there. Pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his  teammates in the dugout  and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages. You'll see the kids  they're  up there hanging it up.  Pete  is that okay    Yup.  And then they put it  right into his stomach. Because he wants them to see what the reality of this is  and how he's never  ever going to give up. And the third thing I  want to leave you with  If you ever come across a situation that you see as so unacceptable  I want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it. Thank you. I know that I'm running over  but I've got to leave you with this  the gifts that my son has given me. I have had    years of having the honor of being the mother of Pete Frates. Pete Frates has been inspiring  and leading his whole life. He's thrown out kindness  and all that kindness  has come back to him. He walks the face of the Earth  right now and knows why he's here. What a gift. The second thing that my son has given me is he's given me my mission in life. Now I know why I'm here. I'm going to save my son  and if it doesn't happen in time for him  I'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what I'm going through. And the third thing   and last but not least gift that my son has given me  as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of August       That girlfriend that he went to get on  the night of diagnosis is now his wife  and Pete and Julie have given me my  granddaughter  Lucy Fitzgerald Frates. Lucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early as the exclamation point on August   st      . And so   And so let me leave you with  Pete's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates  coworkers and teammates. Be passionate. Be genuine. Be hardworking. And don't forget to be great. Thank you.  Applause  I want you guys to imagine  that you're a soldier running through the battlefield. Now  you're shot in the leg with a bullet  which severs your femoral artery. Now  this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less  than three minutes. Unfortunately  by the time that a medic actually gets to you  what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more  with the application of pressure  to stop that type of bleed. Now  this problem is  not only a huge problem for the military  but it's  also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout  the entire medical field  which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body  So now  what I've been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials  which are actually materials that will work with the body  helping it to heal and helping it to allow the  wounds to heal normally. So now  before we do this  we  have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work. So now  everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells. So the cell is the most basic unit of life. But not many people know what else. But it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers  proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix. So now  the ECM is actually this mesh that  holds the cells in place  provides structure for your tissues  but it also gives the cells a home. It allows them to feel what they're doing  where they are  and tells them how to act and how to behave. And it actually turns out that  the extracellular matrix is different from every  single part of the body. So the ECM in my skin is different than the ECM in my liver  and the ECM in different  parts of the same organ actually vary  so it's very difficult to be able to have a product that will react to the  local extracellular matrix  which is exactly what we're trying to do. So now  for example   think of the rainforest. You have the canopy   you have the understory  and you have the forest floor. Now  all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants  and different animals call them home. So just like that  the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions. On top of that  the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing  so if you imagine cutting the body  you actually have to rebuild this very complex ECM in order to get it to form again  and a scar  in fact  is actually poorly formed extracellular matrix. So now  behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix. So as you see  your cells sit  in this complicated mesh and as you move throughout the tissue  the extracellular matrix changes. So now every other piece  of technology on the market can only manage a two  dimensional approximation of the extracellular matrix  which means that it doesn't fit in with the tissue itself. So when I was a freshman at NYU  what I discovered was  you could actually take small pieces of plant derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound. So if you have a bleeding  wound like the one behind me  you can actually put  our material onto this  and just like Lego blocks  it'll reassemble into the local tissue. So that means if you put it onto liver  it turns into something  that looks like liver  and if you put it onto skin  it turns into something  that looks just like skin. So when you put the gel on  it actually reassembles  into this local tissue. So now  this has a whole  bunch of applications  but basically the idea is  wherever you put this product  you're able to reassemble  into it immediately. Now  this is a simulated arterial bleed   blood warning   at twice human artery pressure. So now  this type of bleed  is incredibly traumatic  and like I said before   would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop. Now  in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself  our material is able to stop that bleed  and it's because it actually  goes on and works with the body to heal  so it reassembles into this piece of meat  and then the blood actually recognizes that that's happening   and produces fibrin  producing a very fast clot in less than    seconds. So now this technology   Thank you. So now this technology  by January  will be in the hands of veterinarians  and we're working very diligently to  try to get it into the hands of doctors  hopefully within the next year. But really  once again  I  want you guys to imagine that you are a soldier running  through a battlefield. Now  you get hit in the leg with a bullet  and instead of bleeding  out in three minutes  you pull a small pack  of gel out of your belt  and with the press of a button  you're able to stop your own bleed and you're on your way to recovery. Thank you very much. I haven't told many people this  but in my head  I've got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time. I am also autistic. People tend to diagnose autism with really specific  check box descriptions  but in reality  it's a whole variation as to what we're like. For instance  my little brother  he's very severely autistic. He's nonverbal. He can't talk at all. But I love to talk. People often associate autism with liking maths and  science and nothing else  but I know so many autistic people who love being creative. But that is a stereotype  and the stereotypes of things are often  if not always  wrong. For instance  a lot of people think autism and think   Rain Man  immediately. That's the common belief  that every single autistic  person is Dustin Hoffman  and that's not true. But that's not just with  autistic people  either. I've seen it with LGBTQ people  with women  with POC people. People are so afraid of variety that they try to fit everything  into a tiny little box with really specific labels. This is something that actually happened to me in real life  I googled  autistic people are ...  and it comes up with suggestions as to what you're going to type. I googled  autistic people are ...  and the top result was  demons.  That is the first thing that people think when they think autism. They know. One of the things I can do  because I'm autistic   it's an ability rather than a disability   is I've got a very  very vivid imagination. Let me explain it to you a bit. It's like I'm walking in two  worlds most of the time. There's the real world   the world that we all share  and there's the world in my mind  and the world in my mind  is often so much more real than the real world. Like  it's very easy for  me to let my mind loose because I don't try and fit  myself into a tiny little box. That's one of the best  things about being autistic. You don't have the urge to do that. You find what you want to do  you find a way to do it   and you get on with it. If I was trying to fit myself into a box  I wouldn't be here  I  wouldn't have achieved half the things that I have now. There are problems  though. There are problems with being autistic  and there are problems with having too much imagination. School can be a problem in general  but having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull and you are secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in  which you are not in that lesson  that adds to your list of problems. Also  when my imagination takes hold  my body takes on a life of its own. When something very exciting happens in my inner world  I've just got to run. I've got to rock backwards and forwards  or sometimes scream. This gives me so much energy  and I've got to have an  outlet for all that energy. But I've done that ever  since I was a child  ever since I was a tiny little girl. And my parents thought it was  cute  so they didn't bring it up  but when I got into school  they didn't really agree that it was cute. It can be that people  don't want to be friends with the girl that starts  screaming in an algebra lesson. And this doesn't normally  happen in this day and age  but it can be that people don't want  to be friends with the autistic girl. It can be that people  don't want to associate with anyone who won't  or can't fit themselves into a box that's labeled normal. But that's fine with me  because it sorts the wheat from the chaff  and I can find which people  are genuine and true and I can pick these people as my friends. But if you think about it  what is normal  What does it mean  Imagine if that was the best  compliment you ever received.  Wow  you are really normal.  But compliments are   you are extraordinary  or  you step outside the box.  It's  you're amazing.  So if people want to be these things  why are so many people  striving to be normal  Why are people pouring their  brilliant individual light into a mold  People are so afraid of variety  that they try and force everyone  even people who don't want  to or can't  to become normal. There are camps for LGBTQ people or autistic people to try and  make them this  normal   and that's terrifying that people  would do that in this day and age. All in all  I wouldn't trade my autism and my imagination for the world. Because I am autistic  I've presented documentaries to the BBC  I'm in the midst of writing a book  I'm doing this   this is fantastic   and one of the best  things that I've achieved  that I consider to have achieved  is I've found ways of communicating with my little brother and sister  who as I've said are nonverbal.  They can't speak. And people would often write off someone who's nonverbal  but that's silly  because  my little brother and sister are the best siblings that  you could ever hope for. They're just the best   and I love them so much and I care about them  more than anything else. I'm going to leave you with one question  If we can't get inside the person's minds  no matter if they're autistic or not  instead of punishing anything that strays from normal  why not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination  Thank you. Now  I'm an ethnobotanist. That's a scientist who  works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants. I've been doing this for a long time  and I want to tell you  these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will. But also  these cultures  these indigenous cultures  are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves. And the greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon Rainforest is not the jaguar  it's not the harpy eagle  it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. Now four years ago  I injured my  foot in a climbing accident and I went to the doctor. She gave me heat  she gave me cold  aspirin  narcotic painkillers  anti inflammatories  cortisone shots. It didn't work. Several months later  I was in the northeast Amazon  walked into a village  and the shaman said   You're limping.  And I'll never forget this as long as I live. He looked me in the face and he said   Take off your shoe and give  me your machete.  He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern  threw it in the fire  applied it to my foot  threw it in a pot of water  and had me drink the tea. The pain disappeared for seven months. When it came back  I went to see the shaman again. He gave me the same treatment  and I've been cured for three years now. Who would you rather be treated by  Now  make no mistake   Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised  but there's plenty of holes in it. Where's the cure for breast cancer  Where's the cure for schizophrenia  Where's the cure for acid reflux  Where's the cure for insomnia  The fact is that these people can sometimes  sometimes  sometimes cure things we cannot. Here you see a medicine man in the northeast Amazon treating leishmaniasis  a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts    million people around the world. Western treatment are injections of antimony. They're painful  they're expensive  and they're probably not good for your heart  it's a heavy metal. This man cures it with three plants from the Amazon Rainforest. This is the magic frog. My colleague  the late great Loren McIntyre  discoverer of the source  lake of the Amazon  Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes  was lost on the Peru Brazil border about    years ago. He was rescued by a group of  isolated Indians called the Mats s. They beckoned for him to follow them into the forest  which he did. There  they took out palm leaf baskets. There  they took out these green monkey frogs   these are big suckers  they're like this   and they began licking them. It turns out  they're highly hallucinogenic. McIntyre wrote about this and it was read  by the editor of High Times magazine. You see that ethnobotanists have  friends in all sorts of strange cultures. This guy decided he would go down to the Amazon and give it a whirl  or give it a lick  and  he did  and he wrote   My blood pressure went through the roof  I lost full control of my bodily functions  I passed out in a heap  I woke up in a hammock six hours later  felt like God for two days.  An Italian chemist read this and said   I'm not really interested in the theological  aspects of the green monkey frog. What's this about the change in blood pressure   Now  this is an Italian chemist who's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog  and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug resistant Staph aureus. How ironic if these isolated  Indians and their magic frog prove to be one of the cures. Here's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest Amazon  in the middle of a yage ceremony. I took him to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture. This fellow looked at the medicine man  and he said   You didn't go to  medical school  did you   The shaman said   No  I did not.  He said   Well  then what can you know about healing   The shaman looked at him and he said   You know what  If you have  an infection  go to a doctor. But many human afflictions are diseases  of the heart  the mind and the spirit. Western medicine can't  touch those. I cure them.  But all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines. This is a viper from Brazil  the venom of which was studied at the Universidade de S o Paulo here. It was later developed into ACE inhibitors. This is a frontline treatment for hypertension. Hypertension causes over    percent of all deaths on the planet every day. This is a    billion industry based on venom from a Brazilian snake  and the Brazilians did not get a nickel. This is not an acceptable way of doing business. The rainforest has been called the  greatest expression of life on Earth. There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love   The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask.  But as you all know  it's rapidly disappearing. Here in Brazil  in the Amazon  around the world. I took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the Xingu indigenous reserve in the state of Mato Grosso to the northwest of here. The top half of the picture  you see where the Indians live. The line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve. Top half Indians  bottom half white guys. Top half wonder drugs  bottom half just a bunch of skinny ass cows. Top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs  bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it's driving climate change. In fact  the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere is forest destruction. But in talking about destruction  it's important to keep in mind that the Amazon is the mightiest landscape of all. It's a place of beauty and wonder. The biggest anteater in the world lives in the rain forest  tips the scale at    pounds. The goliath bird eating spider is the world's largest spider. It's found in the Amazon as well. The harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet. And the black cayman   these monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton. They're known to be man eaters. The anaconda  the largest snake  the capybara  the largest rodent. A specimen from here in Brazil tipped the scale at     pounds. Let's visit where these creatures live  the northeast Amazon  home to the Akuriyo tribe. Uncontacted peoples hold a  mystical and iconic role in our imagination. These are the people who  know nature best. These are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature. By our standards  some would dismiss these people as primitive.  They don't know how to make fire  or they didn't when they were first contacted.  But they know the forest far better than we do. The Akuriyos have    words for honey  and other Indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm. Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay. When I was a teenager rocking out to the Rolling Stones in my hometown of New Orleans  Pohnay was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the northeast Amazon in a small band  looking for game  looking for medicinal plants  looking for a wife  in other small nomadic bands. But it's people like these that know things that we don't  and they have lots of  lessons to teach us. However  if you go into most of the forests of the Amazon  there are no indigenous peoples. This is what you find  rock carvings which indigenous peoples  uncontacted peoples  used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe. These cultures that once danced  made love  sang to the gods  worshipped the forest  all that's left is an imprint in stone  as you see here. Let's move to the western Amazon  which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples. Each of these dots represents a small  uncontacted tribe  and the big reveal today is we believe there are    or    isolated groups in the Colombian Amazon alone. Why are these people isolated  They know we exist  they know there's an outside world. This is a form of resistance. They have chosen to remain isolated  and I think it is their human right to remain so. Why are these the tribes that hide from man  Here's why. Obviously  some of this  was set off in     . But at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade. The demand for natural rubber  which came from the Amazon  set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush. Rubber for bicycle tires  rubber for automobile tires  rubber for zeppelins. It was a mad race to get that rubber  and the man on the left  Julio Arana  is one of the true thugs of the story. His people  his company  and other companies like them killed  massacred  tortured  butchered Indians like the Witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide. Even today  when people come out of the forest  the story seldom has a happy ending. These are Nukaks. They were contacted in the '  s. Within a year  everybody over    was dead. And remember  these are preliterate societies. The elders are the libraries. Every time a shaman dies  it's as if a library has burned down. They have been forced off their lands. The drug traffickers have taken over the Nukak lands  and the Nukaks live as beggars in public parks in eastern Colombia. From the Nukak lands  I want to  take you to the southwest  to the most spectacular  landscape in the world  Chiribiquete National Park. It was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues  it has now expanded. It's bigger than the state of Maryland. It is a treasure trove of botanical diversity. It was first explored botanically in      by my mentor  Richard Schultes  seen here atop the Bell Mountain  the sacred mountains of the Karijonas. And let me show you what it looks like today. Flying over Chiribiquete  realize that these lost world mountains are still lost. No scientist has been atop them. In fact  nobody has been atop the Bell Mountain since Schultes in '  . And we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain just to the east of the picture. Let me show you what it looks like today. Not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity  not only is it home to three isolated tribes  but it's the greatest treasure trove of pre Colombian art in the world  over         paintings. The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen described this as the Sistine Chapel of the Amazon Rainforest. But move from Chiribiquete down to the southeast  again in the Colombian Amazon. Remember  the Colombian Amazon is bigger than New England. The Amazon's a big forest  and Brazil's got a big part of it  but not all of it. Moving down to these two national parks  Cahuinari and Pur  in the Colombian Amazon   that's the Brazilian border to the right   it's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples. To the trained eye  you can look at the roofs of these malocas  these longhouses  and see that there's cultural diversity. These are  in fact  different tribes. As isolated as these areas are  let me show you how the  outside world is crowding in. Here we see trade and transport increased in Putumayo. With the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia  the outside world is showing up. To the north  we have illegal gold mining  also from the east  from Brazil. There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes. We see illegal logging coming from the south  and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into Brazil. This  in the past  is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians. And if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry  here's why. This looks like    Applause  This looks like a hangar from the Brazilian Amazon. This is an art exhibit in Havana  Cuba. A group called Los Carpinteros. This is their perception of why you  shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians. But the world is changing. These are Mashco Piros on the Brazil Peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners and timber people. And in Peru  there's a very nasty business. It's called human safaris. They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture. Of course  when you give them  clothes  when you give them tools  you also give them diseases. We call these  inhuman safaris.  These are Indians again  on the Peru border  who were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries. They want to get in there and turn them into Christians. We know how that turns out. What's to be done  Introduce technology to the contacted tribes  not the uncontacted tribes  in a culturally sensitive way. This is the perfect marriage of  ancient shamanic wisdom and   st century technology. We've done this now with over    tribes  mapped  managed and increased protection of over    million acres of ancestral rainforest. So this allows the Indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny. They also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out. These are Indians  trained as indigenous park rangers  patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay. This is a picture of actual contact. These are Chitonahua Indians on the Brazil Peru border. They've come out of the jungle asking for help. They were shot at  their malocas  their  longhouses  were burned. Some of them were massacred. Using automatic weapons to  slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and  disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today  and it has to stop. But let me conclude by saying  this work can be spiritually rewarding  but it's difficult and it can be dangerous. Two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash of a small plane. They were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes. So the question is  in conclusion  is what the future holds. These are the Uray people in Brazil. What does the future hold for them  and what does the future hold for us  Let's think differently. Let's make a better world. If the climate's going to change  let's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse. Let's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation  in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation  can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose. Let's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs. Thanks again. Vision is the most important and prioritized sense that we have. We are constantly looking at the world around us  and quickly we identify and make sense of what it is that we see. Let's just start with an example of that very fact. I'm going to show you a photograph of a person  just for a second or two  and I'd like for you to identify what emotion is on his face. Ready  Here you go. Go with your gut reaction. Okay. What did you see  Well  we actually surveyed over     individuals  and the results were mixed. People did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face. Maybe you saw discomfort. That was the most frequent response that we received. But if you asked the person on your left  they might have said regret or skepticism  and if you asked somebody on your right  they might have said something entirely different  like hope or empathy. So we are all looking at the very same face again. We might see something entirely different  because perception is subjective. What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye. Of course  there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind's eye. I'm going to give you just a few. So dieters  for instance  see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories. Softball players see the ball as smaller if they've just come out of a slump  compared to people who  had a hot night at the plate. And actually  our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people  including politicians. So my research team and I decided to test this question. In       Barack Obama was running for president for the very first time  and we surveyed hundreds of Americans one month before the election. What we found in this survey was that some people  some Americans  think photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks. Of these people     percent voted for Obama in the actual election. Other people  though  thought photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks.    percent of these people voted for McCain. We presented many photographs of Obama one at a time  so people did not realize that what we were changing from one photograph to the next was whether we had artificially lightened or darkened his skin tone. So how is that possible  How could it be that when I look at a person  an object  or an event  I see something very different than somebody else does  Well  the reasons are many  but one reason requires that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work. So vision scientists know that the amount of information that we can see at any given point in time  what we can focus on  is actually relatively small. What we can see with great sharpness and clarity and accuracy is the equivalent of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm. Everything else around that is blurry  rendering much of what is presented to our eyes as ambiguous. But we have to clarify and make sense of what it is that we see  and it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap. As a result  perception is a subjective experience  and that's how we end up seeing through our own mind's eye. So  I'm a social psychologist  and it's questions like these that really intrigue me. I am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye. Why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full  and somebody literally sees it as half empty  What is it about what one person is thinking and feeling that leads them to see the world in an entirely different way  And does that even matter  So to begin to tackle these questions  my research team and I decided to delve deeply into an issue that has received international attention  our health and fitness. Across the world  people are struggling to manage their weight  and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off. For instance  we set the best of intentions to exercise after the holidays  but actually  the majority of Americans find that their New Year's resolutions are broken by Valentine's Day. We talk to ourselves in very encouraging ways  telling ourselves this is our year to get back into shape  but that is not enough to bring us back to our ideal weight. So why  Of course  there is no simple answer  but one reason  I argue  is that our mind's eye might work against us. Some people may literally see exercise as more difficult  and some people might literally see exercise as easier. So  as a first step to testing these questions  we gathered objective measurements of individuals' physical fitness. We measured the  circumference of their waist  compared to the  circumference of their hips. A higher waist to hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit than a lower waist to hip ratio. After gathering these measurements  we told our participants that they would walk to a finish line while carrying extra weight in a sort of race. But before they did that  we asked them to estimate the distance to the finish line. We thought that the physical states of their body might change how they perceived the distance. So what did we find  Well  waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance. People who were out of shape and unfit actually saw the distance to the finish line as significantly greater than people who were in better shape. People's states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment. But so too can our mind. In fact  our bodies and our minds work in tandem to change how we see the world around us. That led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations. So to test whether motivations affect our perceptual experiences in this way  we conducted a second study. Again  we gathered objective measurements of people's physical fitness  measuring the circumference of their waist and the circumference of their hips  and we had them do a  few other tests of fitness. Based on feedback that we gave them  some of our participants told us they're not motivated to exercise any more. They felt like they already met their fitness goals and they weren't going to do anything else. These people were not motivated. Other people  though   based on our feedback  told us they were highly  motivated to exercise. They had a strong goal to make it to the finish line. But again  before we had them walk to the finish line  we had them estimate the distance. How far away was the finish line  And again  like the previous study  we found that waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance. Unfit individuals saw the distance as farther  saw the finish line as farther away  than people who were in better shape. Importantly  though  this only happened for people who were not motivated to exercise. On the other hand  people who were highly motivated to exercise saw the distance as short. Even the most out of shape individuals saw the finish line as just as close  if not slightly closer  than people who were in better shape. So our bodies can change how far away that finish line looks  but people who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easier. That led us to wonder  is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help change their perceptions of the distance  help them make exercise look easier  So we turned to the vision science literature to figure out what should we do  and based on what we read  we came up with a strategy that we called   Keep  your eyes on the prize.  So this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster. It's an actual directive for how to look around your environment. People that we trained in this strategy  we told them to focus their attention on the finish line  to avoid looking around  to imagine a spotlight was shining on that goal  and that everything around it was blurry and perhaps difficult to see. We thought that this strategy would help make the exercise look easier. We compared this group to a baseline group. To this group we said  just look around the environment as you naturally would. You will notice the finish line  but you might also notice the garbage can off to the right  or the people and the  lamp post off to the left. We thought that people who used this strategy would see the distance as farther. So what did we find  When we had them estimate the distance  was this strategy successful for changing their perceptual experience  Yes. People who kept their eyes on the prize saw the finish line as    percent closer than people who looked around as they naturally would. We thought this was great. We were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier  but the big question was  could this help make exercise actually better  Could it improve the quality of exercise as well  So next  we told our participants  you are going to walk to the finish line while wearing extra weight. We added weights to their ankles that amounted to    percent of their body weight. We told them to lift their knees up high and walk to the finish line quickly. We designed this exercise in particular to be moderately challenging but not impossible  like most exercises that actually improve our fitness. So the big question  then  Did keeping your eyes on the prize and narrowly focusing on the finish line change their experience of the exercise  It did. People who kept their eyes on the prize told us afterward that it required    percent less exertion for them to do this exercise than people who looked around naturally. It changed their subjective experience of the exercise. It also changed the objective nature of their exercise. People who kept their eyes on the prize actually moved    percent faster than people who looked around naturally. To put that in perspective  a    percent increase is like trading in your      Chevy Citation for a      Chevrolet Corvette. We were so excited by this  because this meant that a strategy that costs nothing  that is easy for people to use  regardless of whether they're in shape or struggling to get there  had a big effect. Keeping your eyes on the prize made the exercise look and feel easier even when people were working harder because they were moving faster. Now  I know there's more to good health than walking a little bit faster  but keeping your eyes on the prize might be one additional strategy that you can use to help promote a healthy lifestyle. If you're not convinced yet that we all see the world through our own mind's eye  let me leave you with one final example. Here's a photograph of a beautiful  street in Stockholm  with two cars. The car in the back looks much larger than the car in the front. However  in reality  these cars are the same size  but that's not how we see it. So does this mean that our eyes have gone haywire and that our brains are a mess  No  it doesn't mean that at all. It's just how our eyes work. We might see the world in a different way  and sometimes that might not line up with reality  but it doesn't mean that one of us is right and one of us is wrong. We all see the world through our mind's eye  but we can teach ourselves to see it differently. So I can think of days that have gone horribly wrong for me. I'm fed up  I'm grumpy  I'm tired  and I'm so behind  and there's a big black cloud hanging over my head  and on days like these  it looks like everyone around me is down in the dumps too. My colleague at work looks annoyed when I ask for an extension on a deadline  and my friend looks frustrated when I show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long  and at the end of the day  my husband looks disappointed because I'd rather go to  bed than go to the movies. And on days like these  when everybody looks upset and angry to me  I try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them. Perhaps my colleague was confused  perhaps my friend was concerned  and perhaps my husband was  feeling empathy instead. So we all see the world through our own mind's eye  and on some days  it might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place  but it doesn't have to look that way all the time. We can teach ourselves to see it differently  and when we find a way to make the world look nicer and easier  it might actually become so. Thank you. I'm a lifelong traveler. Even as a little kid  I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California. So  from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole  just to go to school. And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly  so the very week after I graduated from high school  I got a job mopping tables so that I could spend every season of my   th year on a different continent. And then  almost inevitably  I became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one. And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet or to wander along the seafronts in Havana with music passing all around you  you could bring those sounds  and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home  and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life. Except  as you all know  one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it. You take an angry man to the Himalayas  he just starts complaining about the food. And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes was  oddly  by going nowhere  just by sitting still. And of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives  a break. But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past. And so  to my great surprise  I found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba. And by going nowhere  I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season  or even  as some people do  a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most  to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions. And of course  this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us. It's an old idea. More than       years ago   the Stoics were reminding us it's not our experience that makes our lives  it's what we do with it. Imagine a hurricane suddenly  sweeps through your town and reduces every last thing to rubble. One man is traumatized for life. But another  maybe even his brother  almost feels liberated  and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew. It's exactly the same event  but radically different responses. There is nothing either good or bad  as Shakespeare told us in  Hamlet   but thinking makes it so. And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler. Twenty four years ago I took  the most mind bending trip across North Korea. But the trip lasted a few days. What I've done with it sitting still  going back to it in my head  trying to understand it  finding a place for it in my thinking  that's lasted    years already and will probably last a lifetime. The trip  in other words  gave me some amazing sights  but it's only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights. And I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads  in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation  that if I really want to change my life I might best begin by changing my mind. Again  none of this is new  that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago  but Shakespeare never had to face     emails in a day. The Stoics  as far as I know  were not on Facebook. We all know that in our on demand lives  one of the things that's most on demand is ourselves. Wherever we are  any time of night or day  our bosses  junk mailers  our parents can get to us. Sociologists have actually found that in recent years Americans are working fewer hours than    years ago  but we feel as if we're working more. We have more and more time saving devices  but sometimes  it seems  less and less time. We can more and more easily  make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet  but sometimes in that process we lose contact with ourselves. And one of my biggest surprises  as a traveler has been to find that often it's exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere who are intent on going nowhere. In other words  precisely those beings who have created the technologies that override so many of the limits of old  are the ones wisest about the need for limits  even when it comes to technology. I once went to the Google headquarters and I saw all the things many of you have heard about  the indoor tree houses  the trampolines  workers at that time enjoying    percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering. But what impressed me even more was that as I was waiting for my digital I.D.  one Googler was telling me about the program that he was about to start to teach the many  many Googlers who practice yoga to become trainers in it  and the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write on the inner search engine  and the ways in which science has empirically shown that sitting still  or meditation  can lead not just to better  health or to clearer thinking  but even to emotional intelligence. I have another friend in Silicon Valley who is really one  of the most eloquent spokesmen for the latest technologies  and in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine  Kevin Kelly. And Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home. And like many in Silicon Valley  he tries really hard to observe what they call an Internet sabbath  whereby for    or    hours every week they go completely offline in order to gather the sense of direction and proportion they'll need  when they go online again. The one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology. And when you speak of the sabbath  look at the Ten Commandments    there's only one word there for which the adjective  holy  is used  and that's the Sabbath. I pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah    its longest chapter  it's on the Sabbath. And we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries  the empty space. In many a piece of music   it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape. And I know I as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe. Now  in the physical domain   of course  many people  if they have the resources  will try to get a place in the country  a second home. I've never begun to have those resources  but I sometimes remember that any time I want  I can get a second home in time  if not in space  just by taking a day off. And it's never easy because  of course   whenever I do I spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that's going to crash down on me the following day. I sometimes think I'd rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails. And every season I do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a friend's birthday party. But as soon as I get to a place of real quiet  I realize that it's only by going there that I'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends. Otherwise  really  I'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness  which is no blessing at all. And so when I was     I decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere. One evening I was coming back from the office  it was after midnight  I was in a taxi driving through Times Square  and I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much I could never catch up with my life. And my life then  as it happened  was pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy. I had really interesting friends and colleagues  I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and   th Street. I had  to me  a fascinating job  writing about world affairs  but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think    or really  to understand if I was truly happy. And so  I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto  Japan  which was the place that had long exerted a strong  really mysterious gravitational pull on me. Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it  I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it. But it's also  as you all know  a beautiful city encircled by hills  filled with more than       temples and shrines  where people have been sitting still for     years or more. And quite soon after I moved there  I ended up where I still am with my wife  formerly our kids  in a two room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle  no car  no TV I can understand  and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist  so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion. But I realized that it gives me what I prize most  which is days and hours. I have never once had to use a cell phone there. I almost never have to look at the time  and every morning when I wake up  really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow. And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises  as it will  more than once  when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression  or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway  I know  in my bones  that it's the time I've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island. I'll always be a traveler    my livelihood depends on it    but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world. I once got on a plane in Frankfurt  Germany  and a young German woman  came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about    minutes  and then she just turned around and sat still for    hours. She didn't once turn on her video monitor  she never pulled out a book  she didn't even go to sleep  she just sat still  and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me. I've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives. Some people go to black hole resorts where they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival. Some people I know  just before they go to sleep  instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube  just turn out the lights and listen to some music  and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed. I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high  dark mountains behind Los Angeles  where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full time monk in the Mount Baldy Zen Center. And I wasn't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of     to which he gave the deliberately  unsexy title of  Old Ideas   went to number one in the charts  in    nations in the world  hit the top five in nine others. Something in us  I think  is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that. who take the time and trouble to sit still. And I think many of us have the sensation  I certainly do  that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen  and it's noisy and it's crowded and it's changing with every second  and that screen is our lives. And it's only by stepping back  and then further back  and holding still  that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture. And a few people do that for us by going nowhere. So  in an age of acceleration  nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow. And in an age of distraction  nothing is so luxurious as paying attention. And in an age of constant movement  nothing is so urgent as sitting still. So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Hawaii  or New Orleans  I bet you'll have a wonderful time. But  if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope  in love with the world  I think you might want to try considering going nowhere. Thank you. I would like to start with the story of Mary  a woman from an African village. Her first memories are of her family fleeing violent riots orchestrated by  the ruling political party. Her brother was murdered by the state sponsored militia  and she was raped more than once just because she belonged to the wrong party. One morning  a month before the election  Mary's village was called  to another intimidation meeting. In this meeting  there is a man standing in front of them  telling them   We know who you are  we know who you will vote for  and if you're not going to drop the right paper  we're going to take revenge.  But for Mary  this meeting is different. She feels different. This time  she's waiting for this meeting  because this time  she's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress  a camera that nobody else can see. Nobody is allowed to film in these meetings. You risk your life if you do. Mary knows that  but she also knows that the only way to stop them and to protect herself and her community is to expose their intimidation  to make sure they understand somebody is following them  to break the impunity they feel. Mary and her friends were filming for months  undercover  the intimidation of the ruling political party. Man  We are now going to speak about the upcoming elections. Nothing can stop us  from doing what we want. If we hear you are with  The Opposition  we will not forgive you.   Militia intimidation rally    The Party  can torture you at any time. The youth can beat you.   Disruption of political meeting   For those who lie  saying they  are back with  The Party   your time is running out.   Party youth militia   Some have died because they rebelled. Some have lost their homes. If you don't work together  with  The Party   you will lead a very bad life. Oren Yakobovich  These images were broadcast all over the world  but more importantly  they have been broadcast back to the community. The perpetrators saw them too. They understood somebody is following them. They got scared. Impunity was broken. Mary and her friends forced the ruling political party not to use violence during the election  and saved hundreds of lives. Mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped  to document human rights violations using cameras. My background should have led me to a different direction. I was born in Israel to a right wing family  and as long as I remember myself  I wanted to join the Israeli army to serve my country and prove what I believed  was our right for the whole land. I joined the Israeli army  just after the first intifada  the first Palestinian uprising  and I served in one of the hard minded  toughest  aggressive infantry units  and I got the biggest gun in my platoon. Quite fast  I became an officer and got soldiers under my command  and as time passed  I started serving in the West Bank  and I saw these images. I didn't like what I saw. It took me a while  but eventually I refused to serve in the West Bank and had to spend time in jail. It was a bit   It was not that bad  I have to say. It was a bit like being in a hotel  but with very shitty food. In jail  I kept thinking  that I need people to know. I need people to understand what the reality in the West Bank looks like. I need them to hear what I heard  I need them to see what I saw  but I also understood  we need  the Palestinians themselves  the people that are suffering  to be able to tell their own stories  not journalists or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation. I joined a human rights organization  an Israeli human rights  organization called B'Tselem. Together  we analyzed the West Bank and picked     families that are living in the most risky places  close to checkpoints  near army bases  side by side with settlers. We gave them cameras and training. Quite fast  we started getting very disturbing images about how the settlers  and the soldiers are abusing them. I would like to share with you two clips from this project. Both of them were broadcast in Israel  and it created a massive debate. And I have to warn you  some of you might  find them quite explicit. The masked men you  will see in the first clips are Jewish settlers. Minutes before the camera was turned on  they approached a Palestinian family that was working their land and told them that they have to leave the land  because this land belongs to the Jewish settlers. The Palestinians refused. Let's see what happened. The masked men that are approaching are Jewish settlers. They are approaching the Palestinian family. This is a demonstration in the West Bank. The guy in green is Palestinian. He will be arrested in a second. Here you see him blindfolded and handcuffed. In a few seconds  he regrets  he came to this demonstration. He's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet. He is okay. Not all the settlers and the soldiers are acting this way. We're talking about a tiny minority  but they have to be brought to justice. These clips  and others like them  forced the army and the police to start investigations. They've been shown in Israel  of course  and the Israeli public was exposed to them also. This project redefined the struggle for human rights in the occupied territories  and we managed to reduce the number  of violent attacks in the West Bank. The success of this project got me thinking how I can take the same methodology to other places in the world. Now  we tend to believe that today  with all of the technology  the smartphones and the Internet  we are able to see and understand most of what's happening in the world  and people are able to tell their story   but it's only partly true. Still today  with all the technology we have  less than half of the world's population has access to the Internet  and more than three billion people   I'm repeating the number   three billion people are consuming news that is censored by those in power. More or less around the same time  I'm approached by a great guy named Uri Fruchtmann. He's a filmmaker and an activist. We understood we were thinking along the same lines  and we decided to establish Videre  our organization  together. While building the organization in London  we've been traveling undercover to places where a community  was suffering from abuses  where mass atrocities were happening  and there was a lack of reporting. We tried to understand how we can help. There were four things that I learned. The first thing is that we have to engage with communities that are living in rural areas  where violations are happening far from the public eye. We need to partner with them  and we need to understand which images are not making it out there and help them to document them. The second thing I learned is that we have to enable them  to film in a safe way. Security has to be the priority. Where I used to work before  in the West Bank  one can take a camera out  most likely not going to get shot  but in places we wanted to work  just try to pull a phone out  and you're dead   literally dead. This is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary  and use mostly hidden cameras. Unfortunately  I can't show you the hidden cameras we're using today   for obvious reasons   but these are cameras we used before. You can buy them off the shelf. Today  we're building  a custom made hidden camera  like the one that Mary was wearing in her dress to film the intimidation meeting of the ruling political party. It's a camera that nobody can see  that blends into the environment  into the surroundings. Now  filming securities go beyond using hidden cameras. Being secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on. To keep our partners safe  we work to understand the risk of every location and of every shot before it's happened  building a backup plan if something goes wrong  and making sure  we have everything in place before our operations start. The third thing I learned is the importance of verification. You can have an amazing shot of atrocity  but if you can't verify it  it's worth nothing. Recently  like in the ongoing war  in Syria or the war in Gaza  we've seen images that are staged  or brought from a different conflict. This misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source  and it's harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources. We use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information and we can trust the material. It starts with vetting the partners  understanding who they are  and working with them very intensively. How do you film a location  You film road signs  you film watches  you film newspapers. We are checking maps  looking at maps  double checking the information  and looking also at  the metadata of the material. Now  the fourth and the most important thing I learned is how you use images  to create a positive change. To have an effect  the key thing is how you use the material. Today  we're working with hundreds of activists filming undercover. We work with them both to understand  the situation on the ground and which images  are missing to describe it  who are the ones that are  influencing the situation  and when to release the material to advance the struggle. Sometimes  it's about putting it in the media  mostly local ones  to create awareness. Sometimes it's working with decision makers  to change laws. Sometimes  it's working with lawyers to use as evidence in court. But more than often  the most effective way to create a social change is to work within the community. I want to give you one example. Fatuma is part of a network of women that are fighting abuses in Kenya. Women in her community have been harassed constantly on their way to school and on their way to work. They are trying to change  the behavior of the community from inside. In the next clip  Fatuma is taking us with her on her journey to work. Her voice is superimposed on images that she filmed herself using hidden cameras. I'm    years old  a mother  And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home. Each morning  I ride the mini bus Number   . But instead of a peaceful journey to work  each day begins with fear. Come with me now and use my eyes to feel what I feel. As I walk  I think to myself  Will I be touched  Grabbed  Violated by this conductor again  Even the men inside the way they look at me touch my body  rub against me  grab me  and now  as I sit in my seat I only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day  my dreams  my children at school  but instead I worry about the moment when we will arrive and I will be violated again. OY  Today  there is a new front in the fight for human rights. I used to carry a big gun. Now  I am carrying this. This is a much more powerful and much  much more effective weapon. But we have to use its power wisely. By putting the right images in the right hands at the right time  we can truly create an impact. Thank you. Thank you. So in the oasis of  intelligentsia that is TED  I stand here before you this evening as an expert in dragging heavy stuff around cold places. I've been leading polar expeditions  for most of my adult life  and last month  my teammate  Tarka L'Herpiniere and I finished the most ambitious  expedition I've ever attempted. In fact  it feels like I've been transported straight here from four months in the middle of nowhere  mostly grunting and swearing   straight to the TED stage. So you can imagine that's a transition that hasn't been entirely seamless. One of the interesting side effects seems to be that my short term memory is entirely shot. So I've had to write some notes to avoid too much grunting and swearing in the next    minutes. This is the first talk I've given about this expedition  and while we weren't sequencing genomes or building space telescopes  this is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something that hadn't been done before. So I hope in that you might  find some food for thought. It was a journey  an  expedition in Antarctica  the coldest  windiest  driest and highest altitude continent on Earth. It's a fascinating place. It's a huge place. It's twice the size of Australia  a continent that is the same size as China and India put together. As an aside  I have experienced an interesting phenomenon in the last few days  something that I expect Chris Hadfield may get at TED in a few years' time  conversations that go something like this   Oh  Antarctica. Awesome. My husband and I did Antarctica with Lindblad for our anniversary.  Or   Oh cool  did you go there for the marathon   Our journey was  in fact     marathons back to back in     days  an       mile round trip on foot from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again. In the process  we broke the record for the longest human powered polar journey in history by more than     miles. For those of you from the Bay Area  it was the same as walking from  here to San Francisco  then turning around and walking back again. So as camping trips go  it was a long one  and one I've seen summarized  most succinctly here on the hallowed pages  of Business Insider Malaysia.   Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition  That Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted   Chris Hadfield talked so eloquently about fear and about the odds of success  and indeed the odds of survival. Of the nine people in history that had attempted this journey before us  none had made it to the pole and back  and five had died in the process. This is Captain Robert Falcon Scott. He led the last team to attempt this expedition. Scott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton  over the space of a decade  both led expeditions battling to become the first to reach the South Pole  to chart and map the interior of Antarctica  a place we knew less about  at the time  than the surface of the moon  because we could see the moon through telescopes. Antarctica was  for the most part  a century ago  uncharted. Some of you may know the story. Scott's last expedition  the  Terra Nova Expedition in       started as a giant siege style approach. He had a big team using ponies  using dogs  using petrol driven tractors  dropping multiple  pre positioned depots of food and fuel through which Scott's final team of five would travel to the Pole  where they would turn around and ski  back to the coast again on foot. Scott and his final team of five arrived at the South Pole  in January      to find they had been beaten to it by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen  who rode on dogsled. Scott's team ended up on foot. And for more than a century this journey has remained unfinished. Scott's team of five died  on the return journey. And for the last decade  I've been asking myself why that is. How come this has remained  the high water mark  Scott's team covered       miles on foot. No one's come close to that ever since. So this is the high water mark  of human endurance  human endeavor   human athletic achievement in arguably the harshest climate on Earth. It was as if the marathon record has remained unbroken since     . And of course some strange and  predictable combination of curiosity  stubbornness  and probably hubris led me to thinking I might be the man to try to finish the job. Unlike Scott's expedition  there were just two of us  and we set off from the coast of Antarctica in October last year  dragging everything ourselves  a process Scott called  man hauling.  When I say it was like walking from here to San Francisco and back  I actually mean it was like dragging something that weighs a shade more than the heaviest ever NFL player. Our sledges weighed     kilos  or     pounds each at the start  the same weights that the weakest of Scott's ponies pulled. Early on  we averaged  .  miles per hour. Perhaps the reason no one had  attempted this journey until now  in more than a century  was that no one had been quite stupid enough to try. And while I can't claim we were exploring in the genuine Edwardian sense of the word   we weren't naming any mountains or mapping any uncharted valleys   I think we were stepping into uncharted territory in a human sense. Certainly  if in the future we learn there is an area of the human brain that lights up when one curses oneself  I won't be at all surprised. You've heard that the average American spends    percent of their time indoors. We didn't go indoors for nearly four months. We didn't see a sunset either. It was    hour daylight. Living conditions were quite spartan. I changed my underwear  three times in     days and Tarka and I shared     square feet on the canvas. Though we did have some technology that Scott could never have imagined. And we blogged live every evening from the tent via a laptop and a custom made satellite transmitter  all of which were solar powered  we had a flexible photovoltaic panel over the tent. And the writing was important to me. As a kid  I was inspired by the  literature of adventure and exploration  and I think we've all seen here this week the importance and  the power of storytelling. So we had some   st century gear  but the reality is that the  challenges that Scott faced were the same that we faced  those of the weather and of  what Scott called glide  the amount of friction between the sledges and the snow. The lowest wind chill  we experienced was in the    s  and we had zero visibility  what's called white out  for much of our journey. We traveled up and down one of the largest and most dangerous glaciers in the world  the Beardmore glacier. It's     miles long  most of its surface is what's called blue ice. You can see it's a beautiful   shimmering steel hard blue surface covered with thousands  and thousands of crevasses  these deep cracks in the glacial ice  up to     feet deep. Planes can't land here  so we were at the most risk  technically  when we had the slimmest chance of being rescued. We got to the South Pole after    days on foot  with one day off for bad weather  and I'm sad to say  it was something of an anticlimax. There's a permanent American base  the Amundsen Scott South Pole Station at the South Pole. They have an airstrip  they have a canteen  they have hot showers  they have a post office  a tourist shop  a basketball court that doubles as a movie theater. So it's a bit different these days  and there are also acres of junk. I think it's a marvelous thing that humans can exist     days of the year with hamburgers and hot showers and movie theaters  but it does seem to produce a lot of empty cardboard boxes. You can see on the left of  this photograph  several square acres of junk waiting to be flown out from the South Pole. But there is also a pole at the South Pole  and we got there on foot  unassisted  unsupported  by the hardest route      miles in record time  dragging more weight than anyone in history. And if we'd stopped there  and flown home  which would have been the eminently sensible thing to do  then my talk would end here and it would end something like this. If you have the right team around you  the right tools  the right technology  and if you have enough self belief and enough determination  then anything is possible. But then we turned around  and this is where things get interesting. High on the Antarctic plateau  over        feet  it's very windy  very cold  very dry  we were exhausted. We'd covered    marathons  we were only halfway  and we had a safety net  of course  of ski planes and satellite phones and live     hour tracking beacons that didn't exist for Scott  but in hindsight  rather than making our lives easier  the safety net actually allowed us to cut things very fine indeed  to sail very close to our absolute limits as human beings. And it is an exquisite form of torture to exhaust yourself to the point of starvation day after day while dragging a sledge full of food. For years  I'd been writing glib lines in sponsorship proposals about pushing the limits of human endurance  but in reality  that was  a very frightening place to be indeed. We had  before we'd got to the Pole  two weeks of almost permanent headwind  which slowed us down. As a result  we'd had several days of eating half rations. We had a finite amount of food in the sledges to make this journey  so we were trying to string that out by reducing our intake to half  the calories we should have been eating. As a result  we both became increasingly hypoglycemic   we had low blood sugar  levels day after day   and increasingly susceptible to the extreme cold. Tarka took this photo of me one evening after I'd nearly passed out with hypothermia. We both had repeated bouts of hypothermia  something I hadn't experienced before  and it was very humbling indeed. As much as you might like to think  as I do  that you're the kind of person who doesn't quit  that you'll go down swinging  hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice. You become utterly incapacitated. It's like being a drunk toddler. You become pathetic. I remember just wanting to lie down and quit. It was a peculiar  peculiar feeling  and a real surprise to me to be debilitated to that degree. And then we ran out of food completely     miles short of the first of the depots that we'd laid on our outward journey. We'd laid    depots of food  literally burying food and fuel  for our return journey   the fuel was for a cooker so you could melt snow to get water   and I was forced to make the decision to call for a resupply flight  a ski plane carrying eight days of food to tide us over that gap. They took    hours to reach us from the other side of Antarctica. Calling for that plane was one of  the toughest decisions of my life. And I sound like a bit of a fraud standing here now with a sort of belly. I've put on    pounds in the last three weeks. Being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar  which is that I've been hoovering up every hotel buffet that I can find. But we were genuinely quite hungry  and in quite a bad way. I don't regret calling for that plane for a second  because I'm still standing here alive  with all digits intact   telling this story. But getting external assistance like that was never part of the plan  and it's something my ego is still struggling with. This was the biggest dream I've ever had  and it was so nearly perfect. On the way back down to the coast  our crampons   they're  the spikes on our boots that we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier   broke on the top of the Beardmore. We still had     miles to go downhill on very slippery rock hard blue ice. They needed repairing almost every hour. To give you an idea of scale  this is looking down towards the mouth of the Beardmore Glacier. You could fit the entirety of Manhattan in the gap on the horizon. That's    miles between Mount Hope and Mount Kiffin. I've never felt as small  as I did in Antarctica. When we got down to the mouth of the glacier  we found fresh snow had obscured the dozens of deep crevasses. One of Shackleton's men described crossing this sort of terrain as like walking over the glass roof of a railway station. We fell through more times than I can remember  usually just putting a ski or a boot through the snow. Occasionally we went in all  the way up to our armpits  but thankfully never deeper than that. And less than five weeks ago  after     days  we crossed this oddly  inauspicious finish line  the coast of Ross Island  on the New Zealand side of Antarctica. You can see the ice in the foreground and the sort of rubbly rock behind that. Behind us lay an unbroken  ski trail of nearly       miles. We'd made the longest ever polar journey on foot  something I'd been dreaming  of doing for a decade. And looking back  I still stand by all the things I've been saying for years about the importance of goals and determination and self belief  but I'll also admit that I hadn't given much thought to what happens when you reach the all consuming goal that you've dedicated  most of your adult life to  and the reality is that I'm  still figuring that bit out. As I said  there are very few superficial signs that I've been away. I've put on    pounds. I've got some very faint  probably  covered in makeup now  frostbite scars. I've got one on my nose  one on  each cheek  from where the goggles are  but inside I am a very  different person indeed. If I'm honest  Antarctica challenged me and humbled me so deeply that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to put it into words. I'm still struggling to piece together my thoughts. That I'm standing here  telling this story is proof that we all can  accomplish great things  through ambition  through passion  through sheer stubbornness  by refusing to quit  that if you dream something  hard enough  as Sting said  it does indeed come to pass. But I'm also standing here  saying  you know what  that cliche about the journey being  more important than the destination  There's something in that. The closer I got to my finish line  that rubbly  rocky coast of Ross Island  the more I started to realize that the biggest lesson that this very long  very hard walk might be teaching me is that happiness is not a finish line  that for us humans  the perfection that so many of us seem to dream of might not ever be truly attainable  and that if we can't feel content here  today  now  on our journeys amidst the mess and the striving that we all inhabit  the open loops   the half finished to do lists  the could do better next times  then we might never feel it. A lot of people have asked me  what next  Right now  I am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets. But as Bob Hope put it  I feel very humble  but I think I have the strength of character to fight it.  Laughter  Thank you.      is a very special year for me     years as a consultant     years of marriage  and I'm turning    in one month. That means I was born in      in a small town in Germany. It was a gray November day  and I was overdue. The hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day. As a matter of fact       was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany  more than  .  million. Last year  we just hit over          so half of my number. What you can see here is the German age pyramid  and there  the small black point at the top  that's me. In red  you can see the potential working age population  so people over    and under     and I'm actually only interested in this red area. Now  let's do a simple simulation of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years. As you can see  the peak is moving to the right  and I  with many other baby boomers  will retire in     . By the way  I don't need any forecasts of birth rates for predicting this red area. The red area  so the potential working age population in       is already set in stone today  except for much higher migration rates. And if you compare this red area in      with the red area in       it is much  much smaller. So before I show you the rest of the world  what does this mean for Germany  So what we know from this picture is that the labor supply  so people who provide labor  will go down in Germany  and will go down significantly. Now  what about labor demand  That's where it gets tricky. As you might know  the consultant's favorite answer to any question is   It depends.  So I would say it depends. We didn't want to forecast the future. Highly speculative. We did something else. We looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany over the last    years  and calculated the following scenario  if Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth  we could directly calculate how many people Germany would need to support this growth. And this is the green line  labor demand. So Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly. Eight million people are missing  which is more than    percent of our current workforce  so big numbers  really big numbers. And we calculated several scenarios  and the picture always looked like this. Now  to close the gap  Germany has to significantly increase migration  get many more women in the workforce  increase retirement age   by the way  we just lowered it this year   and all these measures at once. If Germany fails here  Germany will stagnate. We won't grow anymore. Why  Because the workers are not there who can generate this growth. And companies will look for talents somewhere else. But where  Now  we simulated labor supply and labor demand for the largest    economies in the world  representing more than    percent of world GDP  and the overall picture looks like this by     . Blue indicates a labor surplus  red indicates a labor shortfall  and gray are those countries which are borderline. So by       we still see a labor surplus in some countries  like Italy  France  the U.S.  but this picture will change dramatically by     . By       we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies  including three out of the four BRIC countries. China  with its former one child policy  will be hit  as well as Brazil and Russia. Now  to tell the truth  in reality  the situation will be even more challenging. What you can see here are average numbers. We de averaged them and broke them down into different skill levels  and what we found were even higher shortfalls for high skilled people and a partial surplus for low skilled workers. So on top of an overall labor shortage  we will face a big skill mismatch in the future  and this means huge challenges in terms of education  qualification  upskilling for governments and companies. Now  the next thing we looked into was robots  automation  technology. Will technology change this picture and boost productivity  Now  the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology. A long answer would go like this. Let's take Germany again. The Germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity. In the '  s  I worked in our Boston office for almost two years  and when I left  an old senior partner told me  literally   Send me more of these Germans  they work like machines.  That was     . Sixteen years later  you'd probably say the opposite.  Send me more of these machines. They work like Germans.  Technology will replace a lot of jobs  regular jobs. Not only in the production industry  but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced by robots  artificial intelligence  big data  or automation. So the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs  but when  how fast  and to what extent  Or in other words  will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis  Yes and no. This is a more sophisticated version of  it depends.  Let's take the automotive industry as an example  because there  more than    percent of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place. In       less than    percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts. Today  this number is more than    percent and it will grow to more than    percent by     . And these new electronic parts and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs  like the cognitive systems engineer who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system. In       no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist. As a matter of fact  the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades  in spite of robots and automation. So what does this mean  Yes  technology will replace a lot of jobs  but we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon  and that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch. And this kind of de averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses. So people  high skilled people  talents  will be the big thing in the next decade. If they are the scarce resource  we have to understand them much better. Are they actually willing to work abroad  What are their job preferences  To find out  this year we conducted a global survey among more than         job seekers from     countries. Migration is certainly one key measure to close a gap  at least in the short term  so we asked about mobility. More than    percent of these         job seekers are willing to work abroad. For me  a surprisingly high number. If you look at the employees aged    to     this number is even higher. If you split this number up by country  yes  the world is mobile  but only partly. The least mobile countries are Russia  Germany and the U.S. Now where would these people like to move  Number seven is Australia  where    percent could imagine moving. Then France  Switzerland  Germany  Canada  U.K.  and the top choice worldwide is the U.S. Now  what are the job preferences of these         people  So  what are they looking for  Out of a list of    topics  salary is only number eight. The top four topics are all around culture. Number four  having a great relationship with the boss  three  enjoying a great work life balance  two  having a great relationship with colleagues  and the top priority worldwide is being appreciated for your work. So  do I get a thank you  Not only once a year with the annual bonus payment  but every day. And now  our global workforce crisis becomes very personal. People are looking for recognition. Aren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs  Now  let me connect the dots. We will face a global workforce crisis which consists of an overall labor shortage plus a huge skill mismatch  plus a big cultural challenge. And this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast. Right now  we are just at the turning point. So what can we  what can governments  what can companies do  Every company  but also every country  needs a people strategy  and to act on it immediately  and such a people strategy consists of four parts. Number one  a plan for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills. Workforce planning will become  more important than financial planning. Two  a plan for how to attract great people  generation Y  women  but also retirees. Three  a plan for how to educate and upskill them. There's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us. And four  for how to retain the best people  or in other words  how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture. However  one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes. Employees are resources  are assets  not costs  not head counts  not machines  not even the Germans. Thank you. Ten years ago  I got a phone call that changed my life. At the time  I was  cardiologist at UCLA  specializing in cardiac  imaging techniques. The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo. An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she'd had a stroke. They asked if I'd  come to the zoo and image the animal's heart to look for a possible cardiac cause. Now  to be clear  North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified   board certified veterinarians who take outstanding  care of their animal patients. But occasionally  they do reach into  the human medical community  particularly for some  speciality consultation  and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help. I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gorilla  didn't have a torn aorta  evaluate this macaw for a heart murmur  make sure that this California sea lion's paricardium wasn't inflamed  and in this picture  I'm listening to the heart of a lion after a lifesaving   collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained     cc's of  fluid from the sac in which this lion's  heart was contained. And this procedure  which I have done on many human patients  was identical  with the exception of that paw and that tail. Now most of the time  I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians  discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients  but some of the time  I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians  discussing  symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients. And occasionally  on  the very same day  I went on rounds at  UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo. And here's what started coming into very clear focus for me. Physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their  animal and human patients  congestive heart failure  brain tumors  leukemia  diabetes   arthritis  ALS  breast cancer  even psychiatric syndromes like depression  anxiety  compulsions  eating disorders and self injury. Now  I've got a confession to make. Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad    I had even written my senior  thesis on Darwinian theory    learning about the  significant overlap between the disorders of  animals and humans  it came as a much needed  wake up call for me. So I started wondering  with all of these overlaps  how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian  or consult the veterinary literature  for insights into one  of my human patients  Why had I never  nor had any of my  physician friends and colleagues whom I asked  ever attended  a veterinary conference  For that matter  why was  any of this a surprise  I mean  look  every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans. Every medication that we prescribe or that we've taken ourselves or we've given to our families has first been tested on an animal. But there's something very different about giving an animal a  medication or a human disease and the animal developing  congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer  on their own. Now  maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban. You know  we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant. Well  today's human hospitals  increasingly  are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology. And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles. But I think there's an  even deeper reason. Physicians and scientists  we accept intellectually that our species  Homo sapiens  is merely  one species  no more unique or special than any other. But in our hearts  we don't  completely believe that. I feel it myself when I'm  listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the  Mars Rover on my MacBook. I feel that tug of  human exceptionalism  even as I recognize the  scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species  apart. Well  I'm trying these days. When I see a human patient now  I always ask  what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don't know  And  might I be taking better  care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient  Here are a few examples of the  kind of exciting connections that this kind of  thinking has led me to. Fear induced heart failure. Around the year       human cardiologists  discovered  emotionally induced heart failure. It was described in a gambling father  who had lost his life's savings with a roll of the dice  in a bride who'd been left at the alter. But it turns out  this   new  human diagnosis was neither new  nor was it uniquely human. Veterinarians had been diagnosing   treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos  from to deer to rabbits  since the     s. How many human lives  might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.R. docs and cardiologists  Self injury. Some human patients  harm themselves. Some pluck out patches of hair  others actually cut themselves. Some animal patients  also harm themselves. There are birds that  pluck out feathers. There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed. But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self injury in their self injuring animals. Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and  parents and patients struggling with self injury  Postpartum depression and  postpartum psychosis. Sometimes  soon after giving birth  some women become depressed  and sometimes they become seriously  depressed and even psychotic. They may neglect their newborn  and in some extreme cases  even harm the child. Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally  a mare  soon after giving birth  will neglect the foal  refusing to nurse  and in some instances  kick the foal  even to death. But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing  oxytocin in the mare. Oxytocin is the bonding hormone  and this leads to renewed interest  on the part of the mare  in her foal. Shouldn't this information be put into the hands of ob gyn's and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis  Well  despite all of this promise  unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large. To explain it  I'm afraid I'm going  to have to air some dirty laundry. Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D.'s. I'm talking about dentists and  optometrists and psychologists  but maybe especially animal doctors. Of course  most physicians don't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school  and that when we go  to medical school  we learn everything  there is to know about one species  Homo sapiens  but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals  amphibians  reptiles  fish and birds. So I don't blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession's condescension and ignorance. But here's one from the vets  What do you call a veterinarian who can only take  care of one species  A physician.  Laughter  Closing the gap has become  a passion for me  and I'm doing this  through programs like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA  where we're bringing animal experts  and evolutionary biologists and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and our residents. And through Zoobiquity conferences  where we bring medical schools  together with veterinary schools for collabortive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients. At Zoobiquity conferences  participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher  how understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor  with painful periods  and how better understanding the  treatment of separation anxiety in a high strung Sheltie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school. In the United States and now  internationally  at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check  their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come  together as colleagues  as peers  as doctors. After all  we humans  are animals  too  and it's time for us physicians to embrace our patients' and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species spanning approach to health. Because it turns out  some of the best and  most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human. And one of the best ways  we can take care of the human patient is by  paying close attention to how all the other  patients on the planet live  grow  get sick and heal. Thank you. So  I thought a lot about the first word I'd say today  and I decided to say  Colombia.  And the reason  I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia  but Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil. It's a beautiful country with extraordinary people  like me and others     Laughter     and it's populated with incredible fauna  flora. It's got water  it's got everything to be the perfect place. But we have a few problems. You may have heard of some of them. We have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world. It's been around for over    years  which means that in my lifetime  I have never lived one day  of peace in my country. This guerrilla    and the main group is the FARC guerrillas  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia    they have financed their war by kidnapping  by extortion  by getting into the drug trade  by illegal mining. There has been terrorism. There have been random bombs. So it's not good. It's not really good. And if you look at the human cost of this war over    years  we have had more than  .  million displaced population. It's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world  and this conflict has cost over         lives. So it's a little bit like the Bol var wars again. It's a lot of people who have died unnecessarily. We are now in the middle of peace talks  and we've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully  and as part of that  we decided to try something completely lateral and different  Christmas lights. So Christmas lights  and you're saying  what the hell is this guy going to talk about  I am going to talk about gigantic trees that we put in nine strategic  pathways in the jungle covered with Christmas lights. These trees helped us  demobilize     guerrillas  roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time. These trees were lit up at night  and they had a sign beside them that said   If Christmas can come to the jungle  you can come home. Demobilize. At Christmas  everything is possible.  So how do we know these trees worked  Well  we got      which is okay  but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them  but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them  and we know this because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas. So let me take you back four years before the trees. Four years before the trees  we were approached by the government to help them come up with a communications strategy to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle. The government had a military strategy  it had a legal strategy  it had a political strategy  but it said   We don't really have a communications strategy  and it probably would be a good thing to have   so we decided to immediately jump into this  because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict with the things that we do  with the tools that we have. But we didn't know very much about it. We didn't understand in Colombia   if you live in the cities  you're very far away from where  the war is actually happening  so you don't really understand it  and we asked the government  to give us access to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible. And we talked to about    of them before we felt we fully understood the problem. We talked about    they told us why  they had joined the guerrillas  why the left the guerrillas  what their dreams were  what their frustrations were  and from those conversations came the underlying insight that has guided this whole campaign  which is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations as the people they hold hostage. And at the beginning  we were so touched by these stories  we were so amazed by these stories  that we thought that maybe  the best way to talk to the guerrillas was to have them talk to themselves  so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year  and we put them on the radio and television so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories  their stories  or stories similar to theirs  and when they heard them  they decided to go out. I want to tell you one of these stories. This person you see here  is Giovanni Andres. Giovanni Andres is    when we took that picture. He had been seven years in the guerrilla  and he had demobilized very recently. His story is the following  He was recruited when he was     and sometime later  in his squadron  if you will  this beautiful girl was recruited  and they fell in love. Their conversations were about what their family was going to be like  what their kids' names would be  how their life would be when they left the guerrilla. But it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla  so their romance was discovered and they were separated. He was sent very far away  and she was left behind. She was very familiar with the territory  so one night  when she was on guard  she just left  and she went to the army  she demobilized  and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to  and we were really touched by this story  so we made a radio spot  and it turns out  by chance  that far away  many   many kilometers north  he heard her on the radio  and when he heard her on the radio  he said   What am I doing here  She had the balls to get out. I need to do the same thing.  And he did. He walked for two days and two nights  and he risked his life and he got out  and the only thing he wanted was to see her. The only thing that was in his mind was to see her. The story was  they did meet. I know you're wondering if they did meet. They did meet. She had been recruited when she was     and she left when she was     so there were a lot of other complications  but they did eventually meet. I don't know if they're together now  but I can find out.  Laughter  But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working. The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla. It was not working with the commanders  the people that are more difficult to replace  because you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders. So we thought  well  we'll use the same strategy. We'll have commanders talking to commanders. And we even went as far as asking ex commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them   There is a better life out there    I'm doing good    This is not worth it   etc. But  as you can all imagine  it was very easy to counteract  because what was the guerrilla going to say   Yeah  right  if he doesn't do that  he's going to get killed.  So it was easy  so we were suddenly left with nothing  because the guerrilla were spreading the word that all of those things are done because if they don't do it   they're in danger. And somebody  some brilliant person in our team  came back and said   You know what I noticed  I noticed that around Christmastime  there have been peaks of demobilization since this war has started.  And that was incredible  because that led us to think  that we needed to talk to the human being and not to the soldier. We needed to step away from talking from government to army  from army to army  and we needed to talk about the universal values  and we needed to talk about humanity. And that was when the Christmas tree happened. This picture that I have here  you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees  and that man you see there with the three stars  he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez. Captain Valdez was the first  high ranking official to give us the helicopters  and the support we needed to put these Christmas trees up  and he said in that meeting something that I will never forget. He said   I want to do this because being generous makes me stronger  makes my men feel stronger.  And I get very emotional when I remember him because he was killed later in combat and we really miss him  but I wanted you all to see him  because he was really  really important. He gave us all the support to put up the first Christmas trees. What happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the Christmas tree  operation and all of that said   That's really good  Christmas trees are really cool  but you know what  We really don't walk anymore. We use rivers.  So rivers are the highways of the jungle  and this is something we learned  and most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages. So we went to these river villages  and we asked the people  and probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas. We asked them   Can you send guerrillas a message   We collected over       messages. Some of them were notes saying  get out. Some of them were toys. Some of them were candy. Even people took off their jewelry  their little crosses and religious things  and put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers so that they could be picked up at night. And we sent thousands of these down the rivers  and then picked them up later if they weren't. But lots of them were picked up. This generated  on average  a demobilization every six hours  so this was incredible and it was about  Come home at Christmas. Then came the peace process  and when the peace process started  the whole mindset of the guerrilla changed. And it changed because it makes you think   Well  if there's a peace process  this is probably going to be over. At some point I'm going to get out.  And their fears completely changed  and their fears were not about   Am I going to get killed   Their fears were   Am I going to be rejected  When I get out of this  am I going to be rejected   So the past Christmas   what we did was we asked    we found    mothers of guerrillas  and we asked them to give us  pictures of their children  when they only could recognize themselves  so as not to put their lives in danger  and we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get  which is   Before you were a guerrilla  you were my child  so come home  I'm waiting for you.  You can see the pictures here. I'll show you a couple. Thank you. And these pictures were placed in many different places  and a lot of them came back  and it was really  really beautiful. And then we decided to work with society. So we did mothers around Christmastime. Now let's talk about the rest of the people. And you may be aware of this or not  but there was a World Cup this year  and Colombia played really well  and it was a unifying moment for Colombia. And what we did was tell the guerrillas   Come  get out of the jungle. We're saving a place for you.  So this was television  this was  all different types of media saying   We are saving a place for you.  The soldier here in the commercial says   I'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter so that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the World Cup.  Ex football players  radio announcers  everybody was saving a place for the guerrilla. So since we started this work a little over eight years ago         guerrillas have demobilized. I do not     Applause  Thank you. I don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do  but what I do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization  and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision. If that is true  advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change that we have available. And I speak not only my behalf  but on behalf of all the colleagues I see here who work in advertising  and of all the team that has worked with me to do this  that if you want to change the world  or if you want to achieve  peace  please call us. We'd love to help. Thank you. When I arrived in Kiev  on February   this year  Independence Square was under siege  surrounded by police loyal to the government. The protesters who occupied Maidan  as the square is known  prepared for battle  stockpiling homemade weapons and mass producing improvised body armor. The Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of       after the president of Ukraine  Viktor Yanukovych  rejected a far reaching accord with the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia. In response  tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance. As the months passed  confrontations between police and civilians intensified. I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street. There  I photographed the fighters against a black curtain  a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop of fire  ice and smoke. In order to tell the individual human stories here  I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media. What I was witnessing was not only news  but also history. With this realization  I was free from the photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine. Oleg  Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men  with ordinary lives from ordinary towns. But the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary. I say the word  costume  because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone. They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissioned military equipment  irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police. I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves  this outward expression of masculinity  the ideal of the warrior. I worked slowly  using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter. The process is old fashioned. It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them  in silence  while they look back at me. Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on February     which became known as Bloody Thursday. Snipers  loyal to the government  started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street. Many were killed in a very short space of time. The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue. There were lines of bodies laid in the street. And there was blood all over the pavements. The following day  President Yanukovych fled Ukraine. In all  three months of protests resulted in more than     confirmed dead and many more missing. History unfolded quickly  but celebration remained elusive in Maidan. As the days passed in Kiev's central square  streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people  filling the streets in an act of collective mourning. Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead. They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers. Sadness enveloped Maidan. It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing. I hadn't heard that before. I stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture. Most women cried when I photographed them. On the first day  my fixer  Emine  and I cried with almost every woman who visited our studio. There had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point. And the color of their pastel coats  their shiny handbags  and the bunches of red carnations  white tulips and yellow roses that they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there. It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other. They are about men and women and the way we are    not the way we look  but the way we are. They speak about different gender roles in conflict  not only in Maidan  and not only in Ukraine. Men fight most wars and women mourn them. If the men showed the ideal of the warrior  then the women showed the implications of such violence. When I made these pictures  I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine. But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning. Today  the death toll stands around        while hundreds of thousands have been displaced. I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago. In Maidan  the barricades have been dismantled  and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced  so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square. The fighters  the women and the flowers are gone. A huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field covers the burned out shell of the trade union's building and proclaims   Glory to Ukraine. Glory to heroes.  Thank you. Thank you. I have only got    minutes to explain something  that lasts for hours and days  so I'd better get started. Let's start with a clip from Al Jazeera's Listening Post. Richard Gizbert  Norway is a country that  gets relatively little media coverage. Even the elections this past week passed without much drama. And that's the Norwegian media in a nutshell  not much drama. A few years back  Norway's public TV channel NRK decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven hour train ride    seven hours of simple footage  a train rolling down the tracks. Norwegians  more than a million of them according to the ratings  loved it. A new kind of reality TV show was born  and it goes against all the rules of TV engagement. There is no story line  no script  no drama  no climax  and it's called Slow TV. For the past two months  Norwegians have been watching  a cruise ship's journey up the coast  and there's a lot of fog on that coast. Executives at Norway's National Broadcasting Service are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide. On the surface  it sounds boring  because it is  but something about this TV experiment has gripped Norwegians. So we sent the Listening Post's Marcela Pizarro to Oslo to find out what it is  but first a warning  Viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing. Thomas Hellum  And then follows an eight minute story on Al Jazeera about some strange TV programs in little Norway. Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there  We have to go back to       when one of my colleagues got a great idea. Where do you get your ideas  In the lunchroom. So he said  why don't we make a radio program marking the day of the German invasion of Norway in     . We tell the story at the exact time during the night. Wow. Brilliant idea  except this was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day. So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed what other stories can you tell as they evolve  What other things take a really long time  So one of us came up with a train. The Bergen Railway had its      year anniversary that year It goes from western Norway to eastern Norway  and it takes exactly the same time as it did    years ago  over seven hours.  Laughter  So we caught our commissioning editors  in Oslo  and we said  we want to make a documentary about the Bergen Railway  and we want to make it in full length  and the answer was   Yes  but how long will the program be    Oh   we said   full length.   Yes  but we mean the program.  And back and forth. Luckily for us  they met us with laughter  very  very good laughter  so one bright day in September  we started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes. Actually  it turned out to be seven hours and    minutes due to a signal failure at the last station. We had four cameras  three of them pointing out to the beautiful nature. Some talking to the guests  some information. TH  And that's about it  but of course  also the     tunnels gave us the opportunity to do some archives. Narrator  in Norwegian   Then a bit of flirting while the food is digested. The last downhill stretch before we reach our destination. We pass Mj lfjell Station. Then a new tunnel. TH  And now we thought  yes  we have a brilliant program. It will fit for the       train spotters in Norway. We brought it on air in November     . But no  this was far more attractive. This is the five biggest TV channels in Norway on a normal Friday  and if you look at NRK  over here  look what happened when they put on the Bergen Railway show   .  million Norwegians watched part of this program. And another funny thing  When the host on our main channel  after they have got news for you  she said   And on our second channel  the train has now nearly reached Myrdal station.  Thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this.  Laughter  This was also a huge success in terms of social media. It was so nice to see all the thousands of Facebook and Twitter users discussing the same view  talking to each other as if they were on the same train together. And especially  I like this one. It's a    year old man. He's watched all the program  and at the end station  he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage  and his head hit the curtain rod  and he realized he is in his own living room. So that's strong and living TV. Four hundred and thirty six minute by minute on a Friday night  and during that first night  the first Twitter message came  Why be a chicken  Why stop at     when you can expand that to        minute by minute  and do the iconic journey in Norway  the coastal ship journey Hurtigruten from Bergen to Kirkenes  almost       kilometers  covering most of our coast. It has     year old  very interesting history  and literally takes part in life and death along the coast. So just a week after the Bergen Railway  we called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show. We wanted to do something different. The Bergen Railway was a recorded program. So when we sat in our editing room  we watched this picture    it's all  l Station    we saw this journalist. We had called him  we had spoken to him  and when we left the station  he took this picture of us and he waved to the camera  and we thought  what if more people knew that we were on board that train  Would more people show up  What would it look like  So we decided our next project  it should be live. We wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time. So this is not the first time NRK had been on board a ship. This is back in       when the technical managers have suits and ties and NRK rolled all its equipment on board a ship  and     meters out of the shore  transmitting the signal back  and in the machine room  they talked to the machine guy  and on the deck  they have splendid entertainment. So being on a ship   it's not the first time. But five and a half days in a row  and live  we wanted some help. And we asked our viewers out there  what do you want to see  What do you want us to film  How do you want this to look  Do you want us to make a website  What do you want on it  And we got some answers from you out there  and it helped us a very lot to build the program. So in June          of us went on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship and we set off. I have some really strong memories from that week  and it's all about people. This guy  for instance  he's head of research at the University in Troms  And I will show you a piece of cloth  this one. It's the other strong memory. It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen. And it's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program  and together with thousands of others along the route  they made the program what it became. They made all the stories. This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade. It says   I will be a little late for school tomorrow.  He was supposed to be in the school at   a.m. He came at   a.m.  and he didn't get a note from his teacher  because the teacher had watched the program. How did we do this  Yes  we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten. We turned it into a complete TV control room. We made it all work  of course  and then we took along    cameras. This is one of them. This is my sketch from February  and when you give this sketch to professional people in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK  you get some cool stuff back. And with some very creative solutions. This is Norway's most important drill right now. It regulates the height of a bow camera in NRK's live production  one of    that capture great shots from the MS Nord Norge. Eight wires keep the camera stable. Cameraman  I work  on different camera solutions. They're just tools used in a different context. TH  Another camera is this one. It's normally used for sports. It made it possible for us to take close up pictures of people     kilomteres away  like this one.  Laughter  People called us and asked  how is this man doing  He's doing fine. Everything went well. We also could take pictures of people waving at us  people along the route  thousands of them  and they all had a phone in their hand. And when you take a picture of them  and they get the message   Now we are on TV  dad   they start waving back. This was waving TV  for five and a half days  and people get so extremely happy when they can send a warm message to their loved ones. It was also a great success on social media. On the last day  we met Her Majesty the Queen of Norway  and Twitter couldn't quite handle it. And we also  on the web  during this week we streamed more than     years of video to     nations  and the websites are still there and they will be forever  actually  because Hurtigruten was selected to be part of the Norwegian UNESCO list of documents  and it's also in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest documentary ever. Thank you. But it's a long program  so some watched part of it  like the Prime Minister. Some watched a little bit more. It says   I haven't used my bed for five days.  And he's    years old  and he hardly slept. He kept watching because something might happen  though it probably won't.  Laughter  This is the number of viewers along the route. You can see the famous Trollfjord and a day after  all time high for NRK . If you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June       they will look like this  and as a TV producer  it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it. It looks like this   .  million Norwegians watched part of this program  and we are only five million here. Even the passengers on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship    they chose to watched the telly instead of turning    degrees and watching out the window. So we were allowed to be  part of people's living room with this strange TV program  with music  nature  people. And Slow TV was now a buzzword  and we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about. So we could either take something long and make it a topic  like with the railway and the Hurtigruten  or we could take a topic and make it long. This is the last project. It's the peep show. It's    hours of birdwatching on a TV screen  actually    days on the web. We have made    hours of live salmon fishing. It actually took three hours before we got the first fish  and that's quite slow. We have made    hours of boat ride into the beautiful Telemark Canal  and we have made another train ride with the northern railway  and because this we couldn't do live  we did it in four seasons just to give the viewer another experience on the way. So our next project got us some attention outside Norway. This is from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central. called  National Firewood Night   which consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods  and then eight hours of a fire  burning in a fireplace.  Laughter  It destroyed the other  top Norwegian shows  like  So You Think You Can Watch Paint Dry  and  The Amazing Glacier Race.  And get this  almost    percent of the Norwegian population tuned in     percent. TH  So  when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting  why not knitting  So on our next project  we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater  and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show  he liked that. and after all that  the knitters actually failed to break the world record. They did not succeed  but remember the old Norwegian saying  it's not whether you win or lose that counts. In fact  nothing counts   and death is coming for us all. TH  Exactly. So why does this stand out  This is so completely different to other TV programming. We take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time  and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there  actually being on the train  on the boat  and knitting together with others  and the reason I think why they're doing that is because we don't edit the timeline. It's important that we don't edit the timeline  and it's also important that what we make Slow TV about is something that we all can relate to  that the viewer can relate to  and that somehow has  a root in our culture. This is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks. And of course this is a lot of planning  this is a lot of logistics. So this is the working plan for     people last summer  but more important is what you don't plan. You don't plan what's going to happen. You have to just take your cameras with you. It's like a sports event. You rig them and you see what's happening. So this is actually the whole running order for Hurtigruten      hours  just written on one page. We didn't know anything more when we left Bergen. So you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves  and I'll give you an example of that. This is from last summer  and as a TV producer  it's a nice picture  but now you can cut to the next one. But this is Slow TV  so you have to keep this picture until  it really starts hurting your stomach  and then you keep it a little bit longer  and when you keep it that long  I'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow. Some of you have seen the flag. Some of you start wondering  is the farmer at home  Has he left  Is he watching the cow  And where is that cow going  So my point is  the longer you keep a picture like this  and we kept it for    minutes  you start making the stories in your own head. That's Slow TV. So we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story  and we think that we can continue doing it  not too often  once or twice a year  so we keep the feeling of an event  and we also think that the good Slow TV idea  that's the idea when people say   Oh no  you can't put that on TV.  When people smile  it might be a very good slow idea  so after all  life is best when it's a bit strange. Thank you. The shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson  Missouri  in the wake of the police  shooting of Michael Brown  underscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment  designed for the battlefield  are making their way to small town police departments across the United States. Although much tougher to observe  this same thing is happening  with surveillance equipment. NSA style mass  surveillance is enabling local police departments  to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible. Location information can  be very sensitive. If you drive your car around the United States  it can reveal if you go  to a therapist  attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting  if you go to church  or if you don't go to church. And when that  information about you is combined with the same information about everyone else  the government can gain  a detailed portrait of how private citizens interact. This information used to be private. Thanks to modern technology  the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors. And local police departments make decisions about who they think you are based on this information. One of the key technologies  driving mass location tracking is the innocuous sounding Automatic License Plate Reader. If you haven't seen one  it's probably because you didn't know what to look for    they're everywhere. Mounted on roads or  on police cars  Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing. But more than that  increasingly  local police departments  are keeping records not just of people wanted for wrongdoing  but of every plate that  passes them by  resulting in the collection of mass quantities of data about where Americans have gone. Did you know this was happening  When Mike Katz Lacabe asked his local police department for information about the plate reader data they had on him  this is what they got  in addition to the date   time and location  the police department had  photographs that captured where he was going and  often who he was with. The second photo from the top is a picture of Mike and his two daughters getting out of their car in their own driveway. The government has  hundreds of photos like this about Mike going about his daily life. And if you drive a car  in the United States  I would bet money  that they have photographs like this of you going about your daily life. Mike hasn't done anything wrong. Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information  The reason it's happening is because  as the cost of storing this data has plummeted  the police departments simply hang on to it  just in case it could be useful someday. The issue is not just that one police department is gathering this information in isolation or even that multiple police  departments are doing it. At the same time  the federal government is collecting all of these individual pots of data  and pooling them together  into one vast database with hundreds of millions of hits  showing where Americans have traveled. This document from the  Federal Drug Enforcement Administration  which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this  is one of several that reveal  the existence of this database. Meanwhile  in New York City  the NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers past mosques in order to figure out who is attending. The uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States. In the U.K.  the police department put    year old John Kat on a plate reader watch list after he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations where he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees. License plate readers aren't the only mass location tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today. Through a technique known as a cell tower dump  law enforcement agents can uncover who was using one or more cell towers at a particular time  a technique which has been known to reveal the location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people. Also  using a device known as a StingRay  law enforcement agents can send tracking signals inside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there. And if they don't know which house to target  they've been known  to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods. Just as the police in Ferguson possess high tech military weapons and equipment  so too do police departments across the United States possess high tech surveillance gear. Just because you don't see it  doesn't mean it's not there. The question is  what should we do about this  I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat. History has shown that once the police  have massive quantities of data  tracking the movements of innocent people  it gets abused  maybe for blackmail  maybe for political advantage  or maybe for simple voyeurism. Fortunately  there are steps we can take. Local police departments can  be governed by the city councils  which can pass laws requiring the police to dispose of the data  about innocent people while allowing the legitimate uses of the technology to go forward. Thank you. When we think about mapping cities  we tend to think about roads and streets and buildings  and the settlement narrative that led to their creation  or you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer  but there's other ways to think about mapping cities and how they got to be made. Today  I want to show you a new kind of map. This is not a geographic map. This is a map of the relationships  between people in my hometown of Baltimore  Maryland  and what you can see here is that each dot represents a person  each line represents a relationship between those people  and each color represents a community within the network. Now  I'm here on the green side  down on the far right where the geeks are  and TEDx also is down  on the far right.  Laughter  Now  on the other side of the network  you tend to have primarily African American and Latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are  but just to give some sense  the green part of the network  we call Smalltimore  for those of us that inhabit it  because it seems as though we're living in a very small town. We see the same people over and over again  but that's because we're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city. On the other end of the network  you have folks who are interested in things like hip hop music and they even identify with living in the DC Maryland Virginia area over  say  the Baltimore city designation proper. But in the middle  you see that there's something that connects the two communities together  and that's sports. We have the Baltimore Orioles  the Baltimore Ravens football team  Michael Phelps  the Olympian. Under Armour  you may have heard of  is a Baltimore company  and that community of sports acts as the only bridge between these two ends of the network. Let's take a look at San Francisco. You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco. On the one hand  you do have the media  politics and news lobe that tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities  but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network  and there's even a group that's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as Twitter employees  next to the geeks  in between the gamers and the geeks  at the opposite end of the hip hop spectrum. So you can see  though  that the tensions that we've heard about in San Francisco in terms of people being concerned about gentrification and all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth and settlement into the city are real  and you can actually see that documented here. You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well  the arts community  the music community. And so it leads to things like this.   Evict Twitter   Somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago  and it shows what is happening on the ground in San Francisco  and I think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this. Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro. I spent the last few weeks gathering data about Rio  and one of the things that stood out to me about this city is that everything's really kind of mixed up. It's a very heterogenous city in a way  that Baltimore or San Francisco is not. You still have the lobe of people involved with government  newspapers  politics  columnists. TEDxRio is down in the lower right  right next to bloggers and writers. But then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music. Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here. Other boy bands  country singers  gospel music  funk and rap and stand up comedy  and there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes. How cool is that  And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here. So you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music  but it's represented in a very different way  and I think that maybe fits with our understanding of Rio as being a very multicultural  musically diverse city. So we have all this data. It's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now  maybe even richer than any data set that we've ever had before. So what can we do with it  Well  I think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct. It's something that we choose to do  and we could choose not to do it  and if you kind of think about it  what we're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city and looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria  and seeing how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart. Well maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit. The other thing that we start to realize is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity. We've got people represented from all different types of races across the entire map here    only looking at race doesn't really contribute to our development of diversity. So if we're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems  we need to start to think  about diversity in a new way. And lastly  we have the ability to create interventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way  and I believe that if we have that capability  we may even bear some responsibility to do so. So what is a city  I think some might say that it is a geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings  but I believe that a city  is the sum of the relationships of the people that live there  and I believe that if we can start to document those relationships in a real way then maybe we have a real shot at creating those kinds of cities that we'd like to have. Thank you. I was on a long road trip this summer  and I was having a wonderful time listening to the amazing Isabel Wilkerson's  The Warmth of Other Suns.  It documents six million black folks fleeing the South from      to      looking for a respite from all the brutality and trying to get to a better opportunity up North  and it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance of African Americans  and it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors and the humility  and all the humiliations. It was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men. And I said   You know  this is a little deep. I need a break. I'm going to turn on the radio.  I turned it on  and there it was  Ferguson  Missouri  Michael Brown     year old black man  unarmed  shot by a white police officer  laid on the ground dead  blood running for four hours while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror  and I thought  here it is again. This violence  this brutality against black men has been going on for centuries. I mean  it's the same story. It's just different names. It could have been Amadou Diallo. It could have been Sean Bell. It could have been Oscar Grant. It could have been Trayvon Martin. This violence  this brutality  is really something that's part of our national psyche. It's part of our collective history. What are we going to do about it  You know that part of us that still crosses the street  locks the doors  clutches the purses  when we see young black men  That part. I mean  I know we're not shooting people down in the street  but I'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents are in us. We've been schooled in them as well. I believe that we can stop these types of incidents  these Fergusons from happening  by looking within and being willing to change ourselves. So I have a call to action for you. There are three things that I want to offer us today to think about as ways to stop Ferguson from happening again  three things that I think will help us reform our images of young black men  three things that I'm hoping will not only protect them but will open the world so that they can thrive. Can you imagine that  Can you imagine our country embracing young black men  seeing them as part of our future  giving them that kind of openness  that kind of grace we give to people we love  How much better would our lives be  How much better would our country be  Let me just start with number one. We gotta get out of denial. Stop trying to be good people. We need real people. You know  I do a lot of diversity work  and people will come up to me at the beginning of the workshop. They're like   Oh  Ms. Diversity Lady  we're so glad you're here      but we don't have a biased bone  in our body.  And I'm like   Really  Because I do this work every day  and I see all my biases.  I mean  not too long ago  I was on a plane and I heard the voice of a woman pilot coming over the P.A. system  and I was just so excited  so thrilled. I was like   Yes  women  we are rocking it. We are now in the stratosphere.  It was all good  and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy  and I was like   I hope she can drive.  I know. Right. But it's not even like I knew that was a bias until I was coming back on the other leg and there's always a guy driving and it's often turbulent and bumpy  and I've never questioned the confidence of the male driver. The pilot is good. Now  here's the problem. If you ask me explicitly  I would say   Female pilot  awesome.  But it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome  a little risky  I lean on a bias that I didn't even know that I had. You know  fast moving planes in the sky  I want a guy. That's my default. Men are my default. Who is your default  Who do you trust  Who are you afraid of  Who do you implicitly feel connected to  Who do you run away from  I'm going to tell you what we have learned. The implicit association test  which measures unconscious bias  you can go online and take it. Five million people have taken it. Turns out  our default is white. We like white people. We prefer white. What do I mean by that  When people are shown images  of black men and white men  we are more quickly able to associate that picture with a positive word  that white person with a positive word  than we are when we are  trying to associate positive with a black face  and vice versa. When we see a black face  it is easier for us to connect black with negative than it is white with negative. Seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white. Fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white. You see  we were all outside when the contamination came down. What do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates  You know  one of the things that you probably are thinking about  and you're probably like  you know what  I'm just going to double down on my color blindness. Yes  I'm going to recommit to that. I'm going to suggest to you  no. We've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference trying to not see color. The problem was never that we saw color. It was what we did when we saw the color. It's a false ideal. And while we're busy  pretending not to see  we are not being aware of the ways in which racial difference is changing people's possibilities  that's keeping them from thriving  and sometimes it's causing them an early death. So in fact  what the scientists are telling us is  no way. Don't even think about color blindness. In fact  what they're suggesting is  stare at awesome black people. Look at them directly in their faces and memorize them  because when we look at awesome folks who are black  it helps to dissociate the association that happens automatically in our brain. Why do you think I'm showing you these beautiful black men behind me  There were so many  I had to cut them. Okay  so here's the thing  I'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are. I'm trying to remind you that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings who have changed our lives and made them better. So here's the thing. The other possibility in science  and it's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions  but one thing we know is that if you take a white person who is odious that you know  and stick it up next to a person of color  a black person  who is fabulous  then that sometimes actually causes us to disassociate too. So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell. Just stare at them  right   Laughter  But these are the things. So go looking for your bias. Please  please  just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong. Okay  so that's number one  number two  what I'm going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them. It's not the hardest thing to do  but it's also one of these things where you have to be conscious  and intentional about it. You know  I was in a Wall Street area  one time several years ago when I was with a colleague of mine  and she's really wonderful and she does diversity work with me and she's a woman of color  she's Korean. And we were outside  it was late at night  and we were sort of wondering where we were going  we were lost. And I saw this person across the street  and I was thinking   Oh great  black guy.  I was going toward him without even thinking about it. And she was like   Oh  that's interesting.  The guy across the street  he was a black guy. I think black guys generally know where they're going. I don't know why exactly I think that  but that's what I think. So she was saying   Oh  you were going  'Yay  a black guy'   She said   I was going  'Ooh  a black guy.'  Other direction. Same need  same guy  same clothes  same time  same street  different reaction. And she said   I feel so bad. I'm a diversity consultant. I did the black guy thing. I'm a woman of color. Oh my God   And I said   You know what  Please. We really need to relax about this.  I mean  you've got to realize I go way back with black guys. My dad is a black guy. You see what I'm saying  I've got a  '   black guy son. I was married to a black guy. My black guy thing is so wide and so deep that I can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is  and he was my black guy. He said   Yes  ladies  I know where you're going. I'll take you there.  You know  biases are the stories we make up about people before we know who they actually are. But how are we going to know who they are when we've been told to avoid and be afraid of them  So I'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort. And I'm not asking you to take any crazy risks. I'm saying  just do an inventory  expand your social and professional circles. Who's in your circle  Who's missing  How many authentic relationships do you have with young black people  folks  men  women  Or any other major difference from who you are and how you roll  so to speak  Because  you know what  Just look around your periphery. There may be somebody at work  in your classroom  in your house of worship  somewhere  there's some black young guy there. And you're nice. You say hi. I'm saying go deeper  closer  further  and build the kinds of relationships  the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person and to really go against the stereotypes. I know some of you are out there  I know because I have some white friends in particular that will say   You have no idea how awkward I am. Like  I don't think this is going to work for me. I'm sure I'm going to blow this.  Okay  maybe  but this thing is not  about perfection. It's about connection. And you're not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable. I mean  you just have to do it. And young black men  what I'm saying is if someone comes your way  genuinely and authentically  take the invitation. Not everyone is out to get you. Go looking for those people who can see your humanity. You know  it's the empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you. Something really powerful and beautiful happens  you start to realize that they are you  that they are part of you  that they are you in your family  and then we cease to be bystanders and we become actors  we become advocates  and we become allies. So go away from your comfort into a bigger  brighter thing  because that is how we will stop another Ferguson from happening. That's how we create a community where everybody  especially young black men  can thrive. So this last thing is going to be harder  and I know it  but I'm just going to put it out there anyway. When we see something  we have to have the courage to say something  even to the people we love. You know  it's holidays and it's going to be a time when we're sitting around the table and having a good time. Many of us  anyways  will be in holidays  and you've got to listen to the conversations around the table. You start to say things like   Grandma's a bigot.   Uncle Joe is racist.  And you know  we love Grandma and we love Uncle Joe. We do. We know they're good people  but what they're saying is wrong. And we need to be able to say something  because you know who else is at the table  The children are at the table. And we wonder why these biases don't die  and move from generation to generation  Because we're not saying anything. We've got to be willing to say   Grandma  we don't call people that anymore.   Uncle Joe  it isn't true that he deserved that. No one deserves that.  And we've got to be willing to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism when black parents don't have the luxury to do so  especially those who have  young black sons. We've got to take  our lovely darlings  our future  and we've got to tell them we have  an amazing country with incredible ideals  we have worked incredibly hard  and we have made some progress  but we are not done. We still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations  and it is making for despair and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men. We still struggle  you have to tell them  with seeing both the color and the character of young black men  but that you  and you expect them  to be part of the forces of change in this society that will stand against injustice and is willing  above all other things  to make a society where young black men  can be seen for all of who they are. So many amazing black men  those who are the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived  brave soldiers  awesome  hardworking laborers. These are people who are powerful preachers. They are incredible scientists and artists and writers. They are dynamic comedians. They are doting grandpas  caring sons. They are strong fathers  and they are young men with dreams of their own. Thank you. It used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new  you would have to program it. Now  programming  for those of you here that haven't done it yourself  requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal. Now  if you want to do something that you don't know how to do yourself  then this is going to be a great challenge. So this was the challenge faced by this man  Arthur Samuel. In       he wanted to get this computer to be able to beat him at checkers. How can you write a program  lay out in excruciating detail  how to be better than you at checkers  So he came up with an idea  he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers. And indeed it worked  and in fact  by       this computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion. So Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning  and I have a great debt to him  because I am a machine learning practitioner. I was the president of Kaggle  a community of over         machine learning practictioners. Kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems  and it's been successful  hundreds of times. So from this vantage point  I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past  can do today  and what it could do in the future. Perhaps the first big success of  machine learning commercially was Google. Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm  and this algorithm is based on machine learning. Since that time  there have been many commercial successes of machine learning. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy  movies that you might like to watch. Sometimes  it's almost creepy. Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook sometimes will tell you about who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it  and this is because it's using the power of machine learning. These are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand. This is also how IBM was successful in getting Watson to beat the two world champions at  Jeopardy   answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one.   The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing from this city's national museum in        along with a lot of other stuff    This is also why we are now able to see the first self driving cars. If you want to be able to tell the difference between  say  a tree and a pedestrian  well  that's pretty important. We don't know how to write those programs by hand  but with machine learning  this is now possible. And in fact  this car has driven  over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads. So we now know that computers can learn  and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes don't know how to do ourselves  or maybe can do them better than us. One of the most amazing examples I've seen of machine learning happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle where a team run by a guy called Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery. Now  what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat all of the algorithms developed by Merck or the international academic community  but nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences  and they did it in two weeks. How did they do this  They used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning. So important was this that in fact the success was covered in The New York Times in a front page article a few weeks later. This is Geoffrey Hinton here on the left hand side. Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works  and as a result it's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do. The more data you give it and the more computation time you give it  the better it gets. The New York Times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which I'm going to show you now. It shows that computers  can listen and understand. that I want to be able to take in this process is to actually speak to you in Chinese. Now the key thing there is  we've been able to take a large amount  of information from many Chinese speakers and produce a text to speech system that takes Chinese text and converts it into Chinese language  and then we've taken an hour or so of my own voice and we've used that to modulate the standard text to speech system so that it would sound like me. Again  the result's not perfect. There are in fact quite a few errors. There's much work to be done in this area. Jeremy Howard  Well  that was at a machine learning conference in China. It's not often  actually  at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous applause  although of course sometimes at TEDx conferences  feel free. Everything you saw there was happening with deep learning. The transcription in English was deep learning. The translation to Chinese and the text in the top right  deep learning  and the construction of the voice was deep learning as well. So deep learning is this extraordinary thing. It's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything  and I discovered that a year earlier  it had also learned to see. In this obscure competition from Germany called the German Traffic Sign  Recognition Benchmark  deep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this one. Not only could it recognize the traffic signs better than any other algorithm  the leaderboard actually showed it was better than people  about twice as good as people. So by       we had the first example of computers that can see better than people. Since that time  a lot has happened. In       Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm watch YouTube videos and crunched the data on        computers for a month  and the computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats just by watching the videos. This is much like the way that humans learn. Humans don't learn by being told what they see  but by learning for themselves what these things are. Also in       Geoffrey Hinton  who we saw earlier  won the very popular ImageNet competition  looking to try to figure out  from one and a half million images what they're pictures of. As of       we're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition. This is better than people  again. So machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this  and it is now being used in industry. For example  Google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in France in two hours  and the way they did it was that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers. Imagine how long it would have taken before  dozens of people  many years. This is also happening in China. Baidu is kind of  the Chinese Google  I guess  and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that I uploaded to Baidu's deep learning system  and underneath you can see that the system has understood what that picture is and found similar images. The similar images actually have similar backgrounds  similar directions of the faces  even some with their tongue out. This is not clearly looking at the text of a web page. All I uploaded was an image. So we now have computers which really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of hundreds of millions of images in real time. So what does it mean now that computers can see  Well  it's not just  that computers can see. In fact  deep learning has done more than that. Complex  nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms. As you can see here  this Stanford based system showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment. Deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things. Also  deep learning has been used to read Chinese  again at about native Chinese speaker level. This algorithm developed out of Switzerland by people  none of whom speak or understand any Chinese. As I say  using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this  even compared to native human understanding. This is a system that we put together at my company which shows putting all this stuff together. These are pictures which have no text attached  and as I'm typing in here sentences  in real time it's understanding these pictures and figuring out what they're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that I'm writing. So you can see  it's actually understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures. I know that you've seen something like this on Google  where you can type in things and it will show you pictures  but actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text. This is very different from actually understanding the images. This is something that computers have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months. So we can see now that computers can not only see but they can also read  and  of course  we've shown that they can understand what they hear. Perhaps not surprising now that I'm going to tell you they can write. Here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday. And here is some text that an algorithm out of Stanford generated. Each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures. This algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar. It's seen a man before  it's seen black before  it's seen a guitar before  but it has independently generated this novel description of this picture. We're still not quite at human performance here  but we're close. In tests  humans prefer the computer generated caption one out of four times. Now this system is now only two weeks old  so probably within the next year  the computer algorithm will be well past human performance at the rate things are going. So computers can also write. So we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities. For example  in medicine  a team in Boston announced that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer. Very similarly  in Stanford  a group there announced that  looking at tissues under magnification  they've developed  a machine learning based system which in fact is better than human pathologists at predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers. In both of these cases  not only were the predictions more accurate  but they generated new insightful science. In the radiology case  they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand. In this pathology case  the computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer are as important as the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis. This is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades. In each of those two cases  they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts  but as of last year  we're now beyond that too. This is an example of identifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope. The system being shown here can identify those areas more accurately  or about as accurately  as human pathologists  but was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise by people who have no background in the field. Similarly  here  this neuron segmentation. We can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can  but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous  background in medicine. So myself  as somebody with no previous background in medicine  I seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company  which I did. I was kind of terrified of doing it  but the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques. And thankfully  the feedback has been fantastic  not just from the media but from the medical community  who have been very supportive. The theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible  leaving doctors to do what they're best at. I want to give you an example. It now takes us about    minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test and I'll show you that in real time now  but I've compressed it down to  three minutes by cutting some pieces out. Rather than showing you creating a medical diagnostic test  I'm going to show you  a diagnostic test of car images  because that's something we can all understand. So here we're starting with  about  .  million car images  and I want to create something that can split them into the angle of the photo that's being taken. So these images are entirely unlabeled  so I have to start from scratch. With our deep learning algorithm  it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images. So the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together. So the human  as you can see here  is telling the computer about areas of interest which it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm. Now  these deep learning systems actually are in        dimensional space  so you can see here the computer rotating this through that space  trying to find new areas of structure. And when it does so successfully  the human who is driving it can then point out the areas that are interesting. So here  the computer has successfully found areas  for example  angles. So as we go through this process  we're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we're looking for. You can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis  for example  or a radiologist indicating potentially troublesome nodules. And sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm. In this case  it got kind of confused. The fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up. So here we have to be a bit more careful  manually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs  then telling the computer that this is a type of group that we're interested in. So we do that for a while  we skip over a little bit  and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things  and we hope that it's gotten a lot better. You can see  it's now started to fade some of these pictures out  showing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself. We can then use this concept of similar images  and using similar images  you can now see  the computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars. So at this point  the human can tell the computer  okay  yes  you've done a good job of that. Sometimes  of course  even at this point it's still difficult to separate out groups. In this case  even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while  we still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures are all mixed up together. So we can again give the computer some hints  and we say  okay  try and find a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm. And giving it that hint    ah  okay  it's been successful. It's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that's separated out these together. So you get the idea here. This is a case not where the human is being replaced by a computer  but where they're working together. What we're doing here is we're replacing something that used to take a team of five or six people about seven years and replacing it with something that takes    minutes for one person acting alone. So this process takes about four or five iterations. You can see we now have    percent of our  .  million images  classified correctly. And at this point  we can start to quite quickly grab whole big sections  check through them to make sure that there's no mistakes. Where there are mistakes  we can let the computer know about them. And using this kind of process for each of the different groups  we are now up to an    percent success rate in classifying the  .  million images. And at this point  it's just a case of finding the small number that aren't classified correctly  and trying to understand why. And using that approach  by    minutes we get to    percent classification rates. So this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem  which is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world. The World Economic Forum says that there's between a   x and a   x shortage of physicians in the developing world  and it would take about     years to train enough people to fix that problem. So imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches  So I'm very excited about the opportunities. I'm also concerned about the problems. The problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over    percent of employment. What are services  These are services. These are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do. So    percent of the world's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers  have just learned how to do. What does that mean  Well  it'll be fine. They'll be replaced by other jobs. For example  there will be more jobs for data scientists. Well  not really. It doesn't take data scientists  very long to build these things. For example  these four algorithms were all built by the same guy. So if you think  oh   it's all happened before  we've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs  what are these new jobs going to be  It's very hard for us to estimate this  because human performance grows at this gradual rate  but we now have a system  deep learning  that we know actually grows in capability exponentially. And we're here. So currently  we see the things around us and we say   Oh  computers are still pretty dumb.  Right  But in five years' time  computers will be off this chart. So we need to be starting to think about this capability right now. We have seen this once before  of course. In the Industrial Revolution  we saw a step change in capability thanks to engines. The thing is  though  that after a while  things flattened out. There was social disruption  but once engines were used  to generate power in all the situations  things really settled down. The Machine Learning Revolution is going to be very different from the Industrial Revolution  because the Machine Learning Revolution  it never settles down. The better computers get at intellectual activities  the more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities  so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before  so your previous understanding of what's possible is different. This is already impacting us. In the last    years  as capital productivity has increased  labor productivity has been flat  in fact even a little bit down. So I want us to start having this discussion now. I know that when I often tell people about this situation  people can be quite dismissive. Well  computers can't really think  they don't emote  they don't understand poetry  we don't really understand how they work. So what  Computers right now can do the things that humans spend most of their time being paid to do  so now's the time to start thinking about how we're going to adjust our social structures and economic structures to be aware of this new reality. Thank you. The power of yet. I heard about a high school in Chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate  and if they didn't pass a course  they got the grade  Not Yet.  And I thought that was fantastic  because if you get a failing grade  you think  I'm nothing  I'm nowhere. But if you get the grade  Not Yet  you understand that you're on a learning curve. It gives you a path into the future.  Not Yet  also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career  a real turning point. I wanted to see how children coped  with challenge and difficulty  so I gave    year olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way. They said things like   I love a challenge   or   You know  I was hoping this would be informative.  They understood that their abilities could be developed. They had what I call a growth mindset. But other students felt it was tragic  catastrophic. From their more fixed mindset perspective  their intelligence had been  up for judgment and they failed. Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet  they were gripped in the tyranny of now. So what do they do next  I'll tell you what they do next. In one study  they told us they would probably cheat the next time instead of studying more if they failed a test. In another study  after a failure  they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves. And in study after study  they have run from difficulty. Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error. On the left  you see the fixed mindset students. There's hardly any activity. They run from the error. They don't engage with it. But on the right  you have the students with the growth mindset  the idea that abilities can be developed. They engage deeply. Their brain is on fire with yet. They engage deeply. They process the error. They learn from it and they correct it. How are we raising our children  Are we raising them for now instead of yet  Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting A's  Are we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams  Their biggest goal is getting the next A or the next test score  And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives  Maybe  because employers are coming to me and saying  we have already raised a generation of young workers who can't get through the day without an award. So what can we do  How can we build that bridge to yet  Here are some things we can do. First of all  we can praise wisely  not praising intelligence or talent. That has failed. Don't do that anymore. But praising the process that kids engage in  their effort  their strategies  their focus  their perseverance  their improvement. This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient. There are other ways to reward yet. We recently teamed up with game scientists from the University of Washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet. In this game  students were rewarded for effort  strategy and progress. The usual math game rewards you for getting answers right right now  but this game rewarded process. And we got more effort  more strategies  more engagement over longer periods of time  and more perseverance when they hit really  really hard problems. Just the words  yet  or  not yet   we're finding  give kids greater confidence  give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence. And we can actually change students' mindsets. In one study  we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult  the neurons in their brain can form new  stronger connections  and over time they can get smarter. Look what happened  in this study  students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition  but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades. We have shown this now  this kind of improvement  with thousands and thousands of kids  especially struggling students. So let's talk about equality. In our country  there are groups of students who chronically underperform  for example  children in inner cities  or children on  Native American reservations. And they've done so poorly for so long that many people think it's inevitable. But when educators create growth mindset classrooms steeped in yet  equality happens. And here are just a few examples. In one year  a kindergarten class in Harlem  New York scored in the   th percentile on the National Achievement Test. Many of those kids could not hold a pencil when they arrived at school. In one year  fourth grade students  in the South Bronx  way behind  became the number one fourth grade class in the state of New York on the state math test. In a year to a year and a half  Native American students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district to the top  and that district included affluent sections of Seattle. So the native kids outdid the Microsoft kids. This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed. Before  effort and difficulty made them feel dumb  made them feel like giving up  but now  effort and difficulty  that's when their neurons are making new connections  stronger connections. That's when they're getting smarter. I received a letter recently from a    year old boy. He said   Dear Professor Dweck  I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research  and that's why I decided to put it into practice. I put more effort into my schoolwork  into my relationship with my family  and into my relationship with kids at school  and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas. I now realize I've wasted most of my life.  Let's not waste any more lives  because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth  it becomes a basic human right for children  all children  to live in places that create that growth  to live in places filled with yet. Thank you. Has anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas  Tear gas  Anyone  I'm sorry to hear that  so you might know that it's a very toxic substance  but you might not know that it's a very simple molecule with an unpronouncable name  it's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile. I made it. It's decades old  but it's becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately  it seems  and according to my experience as a non voluntary breather of it  tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects. One  it can really burn your eyes  and two  it can also help you to open them. Tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that I want to share with you this afternoon  that livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be a game changer in journalism  in activism  and as I see it  in the political discourse as well. That idea started  to dawn on me in early      when I was covering a protest in S o Paulo. It was the marijuana march  a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis. When that group started to move  the riot police came from the back with rubber bullets  bombs  and then the gas. But to make a long story short  I had entered that protest as the editor in chief of a well established printed magazine where I'd worked for    years  and thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas  I left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways of sharing the raw experience of what it's like to be there  actually. So in the following week  I was back in the streets  but that time  I wasn't a member of any media outlet anymore. I was there as an independent livestreamer  and all I had with me was basically borrowed equipment. I had a very simple camera and a backpack with  G modems. And I had this weblink that could be shared through social media  could be put in any website  and that time  the protest went along fine. There was no violence. There was no action scenes. But there was something really exciting  because I could see at a distance the TV channels covering it  and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras  and I was basically doing the same thing and all I had was a backpack. And that was really exciting to a journalist  but the most interesting part was when I got back home  actually  because I learned that I had been watched by more than        people  and I got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me  basically  how did I do it  how it was possible to do such a thing. And I learned something else  that that was actually the first time that somebody had ever done a livestreaming in a street protest in the country. And that really shocked me  because I was no geek  I was no technology guy  and all the equipment needed was already there  was easily available. And I realized that we had a frontier here  a very important one  that it was just a matter of changing the perspective  and the web could be actually used  already used  as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical TV channel  TV network  and anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment  even someone like me who had this little stuttering issue  so if it happens  bear with me please  even someone like me could become a broadcaster. And that sounded revolutionary in my mind. So for the next couple of years  I started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways  not only in the streets but mostly in studios and in homes  until the beginning of       last year  when I became the cofounder of a group called M dia NINJA. NINJA is an acronym that stands for Narrativas Independentes  Jornalismo e A  o  or in English  independent narratives  journalism  and action. It was a media group that had little media plan. We didn't have any financial structure. We were not planning to make money out of this  which was wise  because you shouldn't try to make money out of journalism now. But we had a very solid and clear conviction  that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the country. So we launched a Facebook page first  and then a manifesto  and started to cover the streets in a very simple way. But then something happened  something that wasn't predicted  that no one could have anticipated. Street protests started to erupt in S o Paulo. They began as very local and specific. They were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city. This is a bus. It's written there   Theft.  But those kind of manifestations started to grow  and they kept happening. So the police violence against them started to grow as well. But there was another conflict  the one I believe that's more important here to make my point that it was a narrative conflict. There was this mainstream media version of the facts that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge if they presented their own vision of what was actually happening there. And it was this clash of visions  this clash of narratives  that I think turned those protests into a long period in the country of political reckoning where hundreds of thousands of people  probably more than a million people took to the streets in the whole country. But it wasn't about the bus fare hike anymore. It was about everything. The people's demands  their expectations  the reasons why they were on the streets could be as diverse as they could be contradictory in many cases. If you could read it  you would understand me. But it was in this environment of political catharsis that the country was going through that it had to do with politics  indeed  but it had to do also with a new way of organizing  through a new way of communicating. It was in that environment that M dia NINJA emerged from almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon  because we did have the right equipment. We are not using big cameras. We are using basically this. We are using smartphones. And that  actually  allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests  but it allowed us to do something else  to show what it was like to be in the protests  to present to people at home a subjective perspective. But there was something that is more important  I think  than the equipment. It was our mindset  because we are not behaving as a media outlet. We are not competing for news. We are trying to encourage people  to invite people  and to actually teach people how to do this  how they also could become broadcasters. And that was crucial to turn M dia NINJA from a small group of people  and in a matter of weeks  we multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country. So in a matter of a week or two  as the protests kept happening  we were hundreds of young people connected in this network throughout the country. We were covering more than    cities at the same time. That's something that no TV channel could ever do. That was responsible for turning us suddenly  actually  into kind of the mainstream media of social media. So we had a couple of thousands of followers on our Facebook page  and soon we had a quarter of a million followers. Our posts and our videos were being seen by more than    million timelines a week. It was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do. And that turned M dia NINJA into something else  more than a media outlet  than a media project. It became almost like a public service to the citizen  to the protester  to the activist  because they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool to confront both police and media authority. Many of our images started  to be used in regular TV channels. Our livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular televisions when things got really rough. Some our images were responsible to take some people out of jail  people who were being arrested unfairly under false accusations  and we could prove them innocent. And that also turned M dia NINJA very soon to be seen as almost an enemy of cops  unfortunately  and we started to be severely beaten  and eventually arrested on the streets. It happened in many cases. But that was also useful  because we were still at the web  so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country. So M dia NINJA now evolved and finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it would become  a national network of hundreds of young people  self organizing themselves locally to cover social  human rights issues  and expressing themselves not only politically but journalistically. What I started to do in the beginning of this year  as M dia NINJA is already a self organizing network  I'm dedicating myself to another project. It's called Fluxo  which is Portuguese for  stream.  It's a journalism studio in S o Paulo downtown  where I used livestream to experiment with what I call post television formats. But I'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent journalism through a direct relationship with an audience  with an active audience  because now I really want to try to make a living out of my tear gas resolution back then. But there's something more significant here  something that I believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example. I said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal TV network  but I believe it does something else  because after watching people using it  not only to cover things but to express  to organize themselves politically  I believe livestream can turn cyberspace into a global political arena where everyone might have a voice  a proper voice  because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast political discourse  of the verbal aspect of the political dialogue out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone  and it empowers the citizen through this direct and non mediated power of exchanging experiences and dialogue  empowers them to question and to influence authorities in ways in which we are about to see. And I believe it does something else that might be even more important  that the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity in a very political way  as I see it  because it really helps the audience  the citizen  to see the world through somebody else's eye  so it helps the citizen to put him  or herself in other people's place. And that idea  I think   should be the intention  should be the goal of any good journalism  any good activism  but most of all  any good politics. Thank you very much. It was an honor. Our world has many superheroes. But they have the worst of all superpowers  invisibility. For example  the catadores  workers who collect recyclable  materials for a living. Catadores emerged from  social inequality  unemployment  and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the  waste collection system. Catadores provide a heavy   honest and essential work that benefits the entire population. But they are not acknowledged for it. Here in Brazil  they collect    percent of all the waste that's actually recycled. Most of the catadores work independently  picking waste from the streets and  selling to junk yards at very low prices. They may collect over     kilos in their bags  shopping carts   bicycles and carro as. Carro as are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil  much like graffiti and street art. And this is how I first met these  marginalized superheroes. I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social  environmental  and political in nature. In       I took my work beyond walls and onto the carro as  as a new urban support for my message. But at this time   giving voice to the catadores. By adding art and humor to the cause  it became more appealing  which helped call attention  to the catadores and improve their self esteem. And also  they are famous now  on the streets  on mass media and social. So  the thing is  I plunged into this universe  and have not stopped working since. I have painted over      carro as in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions  and trips worldwide. And then I realized that catadores  in their invisibility  are not exclusive to Brazil. I met them in Argentina  Chile  Bolivia  South Africa  Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan. And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it's a big challenge. And then  I created a collaborative  movement called Pimp My Carro a    Thank you. So Pimp My Carro a is a large  crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carro as. Catadores are assisted by well being  professionals and healthcare  like physicians  dentists  podiatrists   hair stylists  massage therapists and much more. But also  they also receive safety shirts  gloves  raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high definition the city  while their carro as are renovated by our incredible volunteers. And then they receive safety items  too  reflective tapes  horns and mirrors. Then  finally  painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge   amazing mobile art exhibition. Pimp My Carro a took to the streets of S o Paulo  Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. But to meet the demand in other cities  including outside of Brazil  we have created Pimpx  which is inspired by TEDx  and it's a simplified  do it yourself  crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carro a. So now everybody can join. In two years  over     catadores      volunteers and     street artists and more than       donors have been involved in the  Pimp My Carro a movement  whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school. So catadores are leaving  invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued. Because of their pimped carro as  they are able to fight back to prejudice  increase their income and  their interaction with society. So now  I'd like to challenge you  to start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other  invisible superheroes from your city. Try to see the world as one   without boundaries or frontiers. Believe it or not  there are over    million  catadores worldwide. So next time you see one  recognize them as a vital part of our society. Muito obrigado  thank you. I'm a lexicographer. I make dictionaries. And my job as a lexicographer is to try to put all the words possible  into the dictionary. My job is not to decide what a word is  that is your job. Everybody who speaks English  decides together what's a word and what's not a word. Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other. Now  sometimes when people are trying  to decide whether a word is good or bad  they don't really have a good reason. So they say something like   Because grammar   I don't actually really care about grammar too much    don't tell anybody. But the word  grammar   actually  there are two kinds of grammar. There's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain  and if you're a native  speaker of a language or a good speaker of a language  it's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language. And this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child. And here's an example  This is a wug  right  It's a wug. Now there is another one. There are two of these. There are two ... Audience  Wugs. Erin McKean  Exactly  You know  how to make the plural of wug. That rule lives in your brain. You never had to be taught this rule   you just understand it. This is an experiment that was invented by a professor at  Boston University  named Jean Berko Gleason back in     . So we've been talking about this  for a long time. Now  these kinds of natural rules  that exist in your brain  they're not like traffic laws  they're more like laws of nature. And nobody has to remind you to obey  a law of nature  right  When you leave the house in the morning   your mom doesn't say   Hey  honey  I think it's going to be cold  take a hoodie  don't forget to obey the law of gravity.  Nobody says this. Now  there are other rules that are more about manners than they are about nature. So you can think of a word as like a hat. Once you know how hats work  nobody has to tell you    Don't wear hats on your feet.  What they have to tell you is    Can you wear hats inside  Who gets to wear a hat  What are the kinds of hats you get to wear   Those are more of the second kind  of grammar  which linguists often call usage   as opposed to grammar. Now  sometimes people use this kind of  rules based grammar to discourage people from making up words. And I think that is  well  stupid. So  for example   people are always telling you   Be creative  make new music  do art   invent things  science and technology.  But when it comes to  words  they're like   Don't  No. Creativity stops right here  whippersnappers. Give it a rest.  But that makes no sense to me. Words are great. We should have more of them. I want you to make as many new words as possible. And I'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English. The first way is the simplest way. Basically  steal them from other  languages.   Go rob other people    Laughter  Linguists call this borrowing  but we never give the words back   so I'm just going to be honest and call it stealing. We usually take words for things  that we like  like delicious food. We took  kumquat  from Chinese  we took  caramel  from French. We also take words  for cool things like  ninja   right  We took that from Japanese  which is kind of a cool trick because  ninjas are hard to steal from. So another way that you  can make words in English is by squishing two  other English words together. This is called compounding. Words in English are like Lego  If you use enough force   you can put any two of them together. We do this all the time in English  Words like  heartbroken    bookworm     sandcastle  all are compounds. So go ahead and make words like  duckface   just don't make duckface. Another way that you can make words  in English is kind of like compounding  but instead you use so much force when you squish the words together that some parts fall off. So these are blend words  like  brunch  is a blend  of  breakfast  and  lunch.   Motel  is a blend of  motor  and  hotel.  Who here knew that  motel   was a blend word  Yeah  that word is so old in English that lots of people don't know that  there are parts missing.  Edutainment  is a blend  of  education  and  entertainment.  And of course   electrocute  is a blend of  electric  and  execute.  You can also make words by changing how they operate. This is called functional shift. You take a word that acts  as one part of speech  and you change it into another  part of speech. Okay  who here knew that  friend  hasn't always been a verb   Friend  used to be noun  and then we verbed it. Almost any word in English can be verbed. You can also take adjectives  and make them into nouns.  Commercial  used to be an adjective  and now it's a noun. And of course  you can  green  things. Another way to make words in English is back formation. You can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit. So for example  in English we had the word  editor  before we had the word  edit.   Edit  was formed from  editor.  Sometimes these back formations  sound a little silly  Bulldozers bulldoze  butlers butle  and burglers burgle. Another way to make words in English is to take the first letters of something and squish them together. So National Aeronautics and Space  Administration becomes NASA. And of course you can do this  with anything  OMG  So it doesn't matter how silly  the words are. They can be really good words of English.  Absquatulate  is a perfectly  good word of English.  Mugwump  is a perfectly  good word of English. So the words don't have have to sound  normal  they can sound really silly. Why should you make words  You should make words because every word is a chance to express your idea and get  your meaning across. And new words grab people's attention. They get people to focus on what  you're saying and that gives you a better chance to get  your meaning across. A lot of people  on this stage today have said   In the future  you can do this  you can help with this  you can  help us explore  you can help us invent.  You can make a new word right now. English has no age limit. Go ahead  start making words today  send them to me  and I will put them  in my online dictionary  Wordnik. Thank you so much. So over the past few centuries  microscopes have revolutionized our world. They revealed to us a tiny world of objects  life and structures that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes. They are a tremendous contribution to science and technology. Today I'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope  a microscope for changes. It doesn't use optics like a regular microscope to make small objects bigger  but instead it uses a video camera and image processing to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people  changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes. And it lets us look at our world in a completely new way. So what do I mean by color changes  Our skin  for example  changes its color very slightly when the blood flows under it. That change is incredibly subtle  which is why  when you look at other people  when you look at the person sitting next to you  you don't see their skin or their face changing color. When we look at this video of Steve here  it appears to us like a static picture  but once we look at this video through our new  special microscope  suddenly we see a completely different image. What you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin  magnified     times so that they become visible. We can actually see a human pulse. We can see how fast Steve's heart is beating  but we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face. And we can do that not just to visualize the pulse  but also to actually  recover our heart rates  and measure our heart rates. And we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients. So here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby from a video we took with a regular DSLR camera  and the heart rate measurement we get is as accurate as the one you'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital. And it doesn't even have to be a video we recorded. We can do it essentially with other videos as well. So I just took a short clip from  Batman Begins  here just to show Christian Bale's pulse. And you know  presumably he's wearing makeup  the lighting here is kind of challenging  but still  just from the video  we're able to extract his pulse and show it quite well. So how do we do all that  We basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded at every pixel in the video over time  and then we crank up those changes. We make them bigger so that we can see them. The tricky part is that those signals  those changes that we're after  are extremely subtle  so we have to be very careful when you try to separate them from noise that always exists in videos. So we use some clever image processing techniques to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video  and then the way the color changes over time  and then we amplify those changes. We make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos  or magnified videos  that actually show us those changes. But it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color  but also tiny motions  and that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras will change not only if the color of the object changes  but also if the object moves. So this is my daughter when she was about two months old. It's a video I recorded about three years ago. And as new parents  we all want to make sure our babies are healthy  that they're breathing  that they're alive  of course. So I too got one of those baby monitors so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep. And this is pretty much what you'll see with a standard baby monitor. You can see the baby's sleeping  but  there's not too much information there. There's not too much we can see. Wouldn't it be better  or more informative  or more useful  if instead we could look at the view like this. So here I took the motions and I magnified them    times  and then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing. Here is a side by side comparison. So again  in the source video  in the original video  there's not too much we can see  but once we magnify the motions  the breathing becomes much more visible. And it turns out  there's a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope. We can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies. We can see that our eyes are constantly moving in this wobbly motion. And that's actually my eye  and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born  so you can see I wasn't getting too much sleep.  Laughter  Even when a person is sitting still  there's a lot of information we can extract about their breathing patterns  small facial expressions. Maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions. We can also magnify small mechanical movements  like vibrations in engines  that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems  or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces. Those are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways  but measuring those motions is one thing  and actually seeing those motions as they happen is a whole different thing. And ever since we discovered this new technology  we made our code available online so that  others could use and experiment with it. It's very simple to use. It can work on your own videos. Our collaborators at Quanta Research even created this nice website where you can upload your videos and process them online  so even if you don't have any experience in computer science or programming  you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope. And I'd like to show you just a couple of examples of what others have done with it. So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez  . I don't know who that user is  but he  or she  used our code to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy. It's kind of creepy. People have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands. And you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs  and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany  and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth that was motion magnified. You can also do some art with it. So this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale. She wanted to see if there's any difference in the way her classmates move. She made them all stand still  and then magnified their motions. It's like seeing  still pictures come to life. And the nice thing with  all those examples is that we had nothing to do with them. We just provided this new tool  a new way to look at the world  and then people find other interesting  new and creative ways of using it. But we didn't stop there. This tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way  it also redefines what we can do and pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras. So as scientists  we started wondering  what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions that we could now use our cameras to measure  And one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound. Sound  as we all know  is basically changes in air pressure that travel through the air. Those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them  which is how we hear and how we record sound. But it turns out that sound also produces visual motions. Those are motions that are not visible to us but are visible to a camera with the right processing. So here are two examples. This is me demonstrating my great singing skills. And I took a high speed video of my throat while I was humming. Again  if you stare at that video  there's not too much you'll be able to see  but once we magnify the motions     times  we can see all the motions and ripples in the neck that are involved in producing the sound. That signal is there in that video. We also know that singers can break a wine glass if they hit the correct note. So here  we're going to play a note that's in the resonance frequency of that glass through a loudspeaker that's next to it. Once we play that note and magnify the motions     times  we can very clearly see  how the glass vibrates and resonates in response to the sound. It's not something you're used to seeing every day. But this made us think. It gave us this crazy idea. Can we actually invert this process and recover sound from video by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects  and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them. In this way  we can turn everyday objects into microphones. So that's exactly what we did. So here's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table  and we're going to turn that  bag of chips into a microphone by filming it with a video camera and analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it. So here's the sound that we played in the room. And this is a high speed video we recorded of that bag of chips. Again it's playing. There's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video just by looking at it  but here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing the tiny motions in that video. I call it    Thank you. I call it the visual microphone. We actually extract audio signals from video signals. And just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here  a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer. That's one thousandth of a millimeter. That's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off objects and gets recorded by our cameras. We can recover sounds from other objects  like plants. And we can recover speech as well. So here's a person speaking in a room. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. Michael Rubinstein  And here's that speech again recovered just from this video of that same bag of chips. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. MR  We used  Mary Had a Little Lamb  because those are said to be the first words that Thomas Edison spoke  into his phonograph in     . It was one of the first sound recording devices in history. It basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder. Here's a demonstration of recording and  replaying sound with Edison's phonograph. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. Testing  testing  one two three. Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. MR  And now      years later  we're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras  and we can even do that when the camera is    feet away from the object  behind soundproof glass. So this is the sound that we were  able to recover in that case. Voice  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow  and everywhere that Mary went  the lamb was sure to go. MR  And of course  surveillance is the first application that comes to mind. But it might actually be useful for other things as well. Maybe in the future  we'll be able to use it  for example  to recover sound across space  because sound can't travel in space  but light can. We've only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology. It lets us see physical processes that we know are there but that we've never been able to see with our own eyes until now. This is our team. Everything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration with this great group of people you see here  and I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website  try it out yourself  and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions. Thank you. In the     s  there were so many right whales in Cape Cod Bay off the east coast of the U.S. that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other. Today  they number in the hundreds  and they're endangered. Like them  many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by     years of whaling  where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat  oil and whale bone. We only have whales in our waters today because of the Save the Whales movement of the '  s. It was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling  and was built on the idea that if we couldn't save whales  what could we save  It was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction. So in the early '  s  there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign. Whales in our waters are still low in numbers  however  because they do face a range of other human induced threats. Unfortunately  many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful. This is actually a disservice  because whales are ecosystem engineers. They help maintain the stability and health of the oceans  and even provide services to human society. So let's talk about why saving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans. It boils down to two main things  whale poop and rotting carcasses. As whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe  they actually release these enormous fecal plumes. This whale pump  as it's called  actually brings essential limiting  nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they  stimulate the growth of phytoplankton  which forms the base of all marine food chains. So really  having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem. Whales are also known to undertake some  of the longest migrations of all mammals. Gray whales off America migrate        kilometers between productive feeding areas and less productive calving  or birthing  areas and back every year. As they do so  they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that have it to places that need it. So clearly  whales are really important in nutrient cycling  both horizontally and vertically  through the oceans. But what's really cool is that they're  also really important after they're dead. Whale carcasses are some of  the largest form of detritus to fall from the ocean's surface   and they're called whale fall. As these carcasses sink  they provide a feast to some     odd species  including the eel shaped  slime producing  hagfish. So over the     years of whaling  when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans  we likely altered the rate and geographic  distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans  and as a result  probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival. Whale carcasses are also known to transport about         tons of carbon  which is the equivalent of that produced by        cars per year from the atmosphere to the deep oceans  and the deep oceans are what we call  carbon sinks   because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere  and therefore help to delay global warming. Sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land. The     years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between    to    percent. Clearly  the Save the Whales movement was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on  but we need to revise this. We need to address the more modern  pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today. Amongst other things  we need to stop them from getting plowed down by container  ships when they're in their feeding areas  and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean. We also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages  so people really understand the true  ecosystem value of these creatures. So  let's save the whales again  but this time  let's not just  do it for their sake. Let's also do it for ours. Thank you. I have a confession to make. As a scientist and engineer  I've focused on efficiency for many years. But efficiency can be a cult  and today I'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality. A few years ago  after finishing my Ph.D.  in London  I moved to Boston. I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge. I bought a racing bicycle that summer  and I bicycled every day to work. To find my way  I used my phone. It sent me over Mass. Ave.  Massachusetts Avenue  the shortest route from Boston to Cambridge. But after a month that I was cycling every day on the car packed Mass. Ave.  I took a different route one day. I'm not entirely sure why I took a different route that day  a detour. I just remember a feeling of surprise  surprise at finding a street with no cars  as opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave. full of cars  surprise at finding a street  draped by leaves and surrounded by trees. But after the feeling  of surprise  I felt shame. How could I have been so blind  For an entire month  I was so trapped in my mobile app that a journey to work became one thing only  the shortest path. In this single journey  there was no thought of enjoying the road  no pleasure in connecting with nature  no possibility of looking people in the eyes. And why  Because I was saving a minute out of my commute. Now let me ask you  Am I alone here  How many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions  Most of you  if not all  have. And don't get me wrong    mapping apps are the greatest game changer for encouraging people to explore the city. You take your phone out and you know immediately where to go. However  the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination. It has the power to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination. After that experience  I changed. I changed my research from traditional data mining to understanding how people experience the city. I used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale  at web scale. I became captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by Jane Jacobs  Stanley Milgram  Kevin Lynch. The result of that research has been the creation of new maps  maps where you don't only find the shortest path  the blue one  but also the most enjoyable path  the red one. How was that possible  Einstein once said   Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.  So with a bit of imagination  we needed to understand which parts of the city people find beautiful. At the University of Cambridge  with colleagues  we thought about this simple experiment. If I were to show you these two urban scenes  and I were to ask you which one is more beautiful  which one would you say  Don't be shy. Who says A  Who says B  Brilliant. Based on that idea  we built a crowdsourcing platform  a web game. Players are shown pairs of urban scenes  and they're asked to choose which one  is more beautiful  quiet and happy. Based on thousands of user votes  then we are able to see where consensus emerges. We are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy. After that work  I joined Yahoo Labs  and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano  and together  we aggregated those winning locations in London to build a new map of the city  a cartography weighted for human emotions. On this cartography  you're not only able to see and connect from point A to point B  the shortest segments  but you're also able to see the happy segment  the beautiful path  the quiet path. In tests  participants found the happy  the beautiful  the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one  and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time. Participants also love to attach memories to places. Shared memories    that's where the old BBC building was  and personal memories    that's where I gave my first kiss. They also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded. So what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell  sound   and memories  That's where our research is going right now. More generally  my research  what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path  to avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live. Walk the path through the park  not through the car park  and you have an entirely different path. Walk the path full of people you love and not full of cars  and you have an entirely different path. It's that simple. I would like to end with this thought  do you remember  The Truman Show   It's a media satire in which a real person doesn't know he's living in a fabricated world. Perhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency. Look at some of your daily habits  and as Truman did in the movie  escape the fabricated world. Why  Well  if you think that adventure is dangerous  try routine. It's deadly. Thank you. I'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder  but this is not how I started. When I was seven years old  I remember watching television and seeing people throwing rocks  and thinking  this must be a fun thing to do. So I got out to the street and threw rocks  not realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars. Instead  I ended up stoning my neighbors' cars.  Laughter  They were not enthusiastic about my patriotism. This is my picture with my brother. This is me  the little one  and I know what you're thinking   You used to look cute  what the heck happened to you   But my brother  who is older than me  was arrested when he was     taken to prison on charges of throwing stones. He was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones  and as a result  had internal injuries that caused his death soon after he was released from prison. I was angry  I was bitter  and all I wanted was revenge. But that changed when I was   . I decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job  and going to study Hebrew in that classroom was the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers. And we connected over really small things  like the fact that I love country music  which is really strange for Palestinians. But it was then that I realized also that we have a wall of anger  of hatred and of ignorance that separates us. I decided that it doesn't matter what happens to me. What really matters is how I deal with it. And therefore  I decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people. I do so through many ways. Tourism is one of them  but also media and education  and you might be wondering  really  can tourism change things  Can it bring down walls  Yes. Tourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls and to create a sustainable way of connecting with each other and creating friendships. In       I cofounded Mejdi Tours  a social enterprise that aims to connect people  with two Jewish friends  by the way  and what we'll do  the model we did  for example  in Jerusalem  we would have two tour guides  one Israeli and one Palestinian  guiding the trips together  telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict from totally different perspectives. I remember running a trip together with a friend named Kobi    Jewish congregation from Chicago  the trip was in Jerusalem    and we took them to a refugee camp  a Palestinian refugee camp  and there we had this amazing food. By the way  this is my mother. She's cool. And that's the Palestinian food called maqluba. It means  upside down.  You cook it with rice and chicken  and you flip it upside down. It's the best meal ever. And we'll eat together. Then we had a joint band  Israeli and Palestinian musicians  and we did some belly dancing. If you don't know any  I'll teach you later. But when we left  both sides  they were crying because they did not want to leave. Three years later  those relationships still exist. Imagine with me if the one billion people who travel internationally  every year travel like this  not being taken in the bus from one side to another  from one hotel to another  taking pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures  but actually connecting with people. You know  I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K. going to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family  and having their first Friday night dinners  that Sabbath dinner  and eating together hamin  which is a Jewish food  a stew  just having the connection of realizing  after a while  that a hundred years ago  their families came out of the same place in Northern Africa. This is not a photo profile for your Facebook. This is not disaster tourism. This is the future of travel  and I invite you to join me to do that  to change your travel. We're doing it all over the world now  from Ireland to Iran to Turkey  and we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world. Thank you. Guatemala is recovering from a    year armed conflict. A conflict that was fought during the Cold War. It was really just  a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state. What we have as a result is         civilian victims          of those killed in the communities  small children  men  women   the elderly even. And then we have  about        others  the missing  the ones we're still looking for today. We call them the Desaparecidos. Now     percent of the victims  are Mayan victims  victims that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of  Central America. And only about    percent are of  European descent. But the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to  defend us  the police  the military  are the ones that committed most of the crimes. Now the families  they want information. They want to know what happened. They want the bodies of their loved ones. But most of all  what they want is they want you  they want everyone to know that their loved ones did nothing wrong. Now  my case was that my father received death threats in     . And we left. We left Guatemala and we came here. So I grew up in New York  I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact  and I went to New Utrecht High School and I graduated from Brooklyn College. The only thing was that I really didn't know what  was happening in Guatemala. I didn't care for it  it was too painful. But it wasn't till      that I decided to do something about it. So I went back. I went back to Guatemala   to look for the bodies  to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well. The way we work is that we give people information. We talk to the family members and we let them choose. We let them decide to tell us the stories  to tell us what they saw  to tell us about their loved ones. And even more important  we let them choose to give us a piece of themselves. A piece  an essence  of who they are. And that DNA is what we're  going to compare to the DNA that comes from the skeletons. While we're doing that  though  we're looking for the bodies. And these are skeletons by now  most of these crimes  happened    years ago. When we find the grave  we take out the dirt and eventually clean  the body  document it  and exhume it. We literally bring the  skeleton out of the ground. Once we have those bodies  though  we take them back to the city  to our lab  and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things  One is how people died. So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound  for example. The other thing we want to understand is who they are. Whether it's a baby  or an adult. Whether it's a woman or a man. But when we're done with that analysis what we'll do is we'll take a small  fragment of the bone and we'll extract DNA from it. We'll take that DNA and then we'll compare it with the DNA of the families  of course. The best way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases. The first is the case  of the military diary. Now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in     . And what you see there is the state following individuals  people that  like you   wanted to change their country  and they jotted everything down. And one of the things that they wrote  down is when they executed them. Inside that yellow rectangle   you see a code  it's a secret code     . And then you see a date. The     means  executed  and the date  means when they were executed. Now that's going to come into play in a second. What we did is we conducted an exhumation in       where we exhumed     bodies from    graves in a military base. Grave    though  matched the family of Sergio Saul Linares. Now Sergio was a professor at the university. He graduted from Iowa State University and went back to Guatemala to change his country. And he was captured on  February         . And if you can see there  he was  executed on March           which was incredible. We had the body  we had the family's  information and their DNA  and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened. But most important is about two weeks later  we go another hit  another match from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro. The DNA of that body also matched the DNA of that family. And then we noticed that he was also in the diary. But it was amazing to see that he was  also executed on March         . So that led us to think  hmm   how many bodies were in the grave  Six. So then we said  how many people were executed on March           That's right  six as well. So we have Juan de Dios  Hugo  Moises and Zoilo. All of them executed on the same date   all captured at different locations and at different moments. All put in that grave. The only thing we needed now was the DNA of those four families So we went and we looked for them and we found them. And we identified those six bodies and gave them back to the families. The other case I want to tell you about is that of a military base  called CREOMPAZ. It actually means   to believe in peace   but the acronym really means Regional Command Center for Peacekeeping Operations. And this is where the Guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries  the ones that serve with the U.N. and go to countries like Haiti and the Congo. Well  we have testimony that said that within this military base  there were bodies  there were graves. So we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in  we found the first of    graves   a total of     bodies. Now  if you think about that  peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies. It's very ironic. But the bodies    face down  most of them  hands tied behind their backs  blindfolded  all types of trauma    these were people who were defenseless who were being executed. People that     families are looking for. So we're going to focus on Grave   . Grave     what we noticed  was a grave full of women and children     of them. And that immediately made us think  my goodness  where is there a case like this  When I got to Guatemala in       I heard of a case of a massacre that happened on May           where the army came in  killed the men  and took the women and children  in helicopters to an unknown location. Well  guess what  The clothing from this grave matched the  clothing from the region where these people were taken from  where these women and children  were taken from. So we conducted some DNA analysis  and guess what  We identified Martina Rojas  and Manuel Chen. Both of them disappeared in that case  and now we could prove it. We have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people  were taken to this base. Now  Manuel Chen was three years old. His mother went to the river to wash  clothes  and she left him with a neighbor. That's when the army came and that's when he was taken away in  a helicopter and never seen again until we found him in Grave   . So now with science  with archaeology   with anthropology  with genetics  what we're doing is  we're giving a voice to the voiceless. But we're doing more than that. We're actually providing  evidence for trials  like the genocide trial that happened  last year in Guatemala where General R os Montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to    years. So I came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere    it's happening in Mexico right in front of us today    and we can't let it go on anymore. We have to now come together and decide that we're not going to have  any more missing. So no more missing  guys. Okay  No more missing. Thank you. When the Portuguese arrived in Latin America about     years ago  they obviously found this amazing tropical forest. And among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before  they found one species that caught their attention very quickly. This species  when you cut the bark  you find a very dark red resin that was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes. The indigenous people called this species pau brasil  and that's the reason why this land became  land of Brasil   and later on  Brazil. That's the only country in the world that has the name of a tree. So you can imagine that it's very cool to be a forester in Brazil  among other reasons. Forest products are all around us. Apart from all those products  the forest is very important for climate regulation. In Brazil  almost    percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the forest. Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere    billion tons of water every day. This is more than what the Amazon River  which is the largest river in the world  puts in the sea per day  which is    billion tons. If we had to boil water to get the same effect as evapotranspiration  we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world. So it's a hell of a service for all of us. We have in the world about four billion hectares of forests. This is more or less China  U.S.  Canada and Brazil all together  in terms of size  to have an idea. Three quarters of that is in the temperate zone  and just one quarter is in the tropics  but this one quarter  one billion hectares  holds most of the biodiversity  and very importantly     percent of the living biomass  the carbon. Now  we used to have six billion hectares of forest       percent more than what we have          years ago. We've actually lost two billion hectares in the last       years. But in the last     years  we lost half of that. That was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests to deforestation of tropical forests. So think of this  In     years  we lost the same amount of forest in the tropics that we lost in       years in temperate forests. That's the speed of the destruction that we are having. Now  Brazil is an important piece of this puzzle. We have the second largest forest in the world  just after Russia. It means    percent of all the world's forests are in Brazil  most of that in the Amazon. It's the largest piece of forest we have. It's a very big  large area. You can see that you could fit many of the European countries there. We still have    percent of the forest cover. That's the good news. But we lost    percent in just    years. So if you go with that speed  very soon  we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the Amazon that regulates our climate. Deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end of the '  s and the beginning of the     s. Twenty seven thousand square kilometers in one year. This is  .  million hectares. It's almost like half of Costa Rica every year. So at this moment    this is               I happened to be coming to work in the government. And together with other teammates in the National Forest Department  we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation  and make a plan to combat that at a national level  involving the local governments  the civil society  business  local communities  in an effort that could tackle those causes. So we came up with this plan with     actions in different areas. Now I will go through all of them one by one    no  just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years. So the first thing  we set up a system with the national space agency that could actually see where deforestation is happening  almost in real time. So now in Brazil   we have this system  DETER  where every month  or every two months  we get information on where deforestation is happening so we can actually act when it's happening. And all the information is fully transparent so others can replicate that in independent systems. This allows us  among other things  to apprehend  .  million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken. Part of that we saw and sell  and all the revenue becomes a fund that now funds conservation projects of local communities as an endowment fund. This also allows us to make a big operation to seize corruption and illegal activities that ended up having     people in prison  including a lot of public servants. Then we made the connection that areas that have been doing illegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance. So we cut this through the bank system and then linked this to the end users. So supermarkets  the slaughterhouses  and so on that buy products from illegal clear cut areas  they also can be liable for the deforestation. So making all these connections to help to push the problem down. And also we work a lot on land tenure issues. It's very important for conflicts. Fifty million hectares of protected areas were created  which is an area the size of Spain. And of those  eight million were indigenous lands. Now we start to see results. So in the last    years  deforestation came down in Brazil    percent. So if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade  we saved  .  million hectares  which is the size of Austria. But more importantly  it avoided the emission of three billion tons of CO  in the atmosphere. This is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  until today  as a positive action. One may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease  to push down deforestation  you will have an economic impact because you will not have economic activity or something like that. But it's interesting to know that it's quite the opposite. In fact  in the period when we have the deepest decline of deforestation  the economy grew  on average  double from the previous decade  when deforestation was actually going up. So it's a good lesson for us. Maybe this is completely disconnected  as we just learned by having deforestation come down. Now this is all good news  and it's quite an achievement  and we obviously should be very proud about that. But it's not even close to sufficient. In fact  if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in       that was over half a million hectares  which means that every minute  an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the Amazon last year  just last year. If we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in Brazil  we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world. It's more or less like we are forest heroes  but still deforestation champions. So we can't be satisfied  not even close to satisfied. So the next step  I think  is to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil and to have that as a goal for     . That's our next step. Now I've always been interested in the relationship between climate change and forests. First  because    percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation  so it's a big part of the problem. But also  forests can be a big part of the solution since that's the best way we know to sink  capture and store carbon. Now  there is another relationship of climate and forests that really stuck me in      and made me change my career from forests to working with climate change. I went to visit Canada  in British Columbia  together with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a kind of alliance of them  like Canada  Russia  India  China  U.S. And when we were there we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forests in Canada. What we see here  those brown trees  these are really dead trees. They are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the beetle. What happens is that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter. For many years now  they don't have the sufficient cold weather to actually control the population of this beetle. And it became a disease that is really killing billions of trees. So I came back with this notion that the forest is actually one of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change. So I was thinking  if I succeed in working with all my colleagues to actually help to stop deforestation  maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change by floods  heat  fires and so on. So I decided to leave the forest service and start to work directly on climate change  find a way to think and understand the challenge  and go from there. Now  the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward. The goal is very clear. We want to limit the increase of the average temperature of the planet to two degrees. There are several reasons for that. I will not get into that now. But in order to get to this limit of two degrees  which is possible for us to survive  the IPCC  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  defines that we have a budget of emissions of       billion tons of CO  from now until the end of the century. So if we divide this by the number of years  what we have is an average budget of    billion tons of CO  per year. Now what is one ton of CO   It's more or less what one small car  running    kilometers a day  will emit in one year. Or it's one flight  one way  from S o Paulo to Johannesburg or to London  one way. Two ways  two tons. So    billion tons is twice that. Now the emissions today are    billion tons  and it's growing. It's growing and maybe it will be    by     . Now we need to go down to    by     . And while this happens  the population will grow from seven to nine billion people  the economy will grow from    trillion dollars in      to     trillion dollars. And so what we need to do is to be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person  per year  into something like one. You have to choose. You take the airplane or you have a car. So the question is  can we make it  And that's the exactly the same question I got when I was developing a plan to combat deforestation. It's such a big problem  so complex. Can we really do it  I think so. Think of this  Deforestation means    percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil in the last decade. Now it's a little bit less than    percent. In the world     percent is energy. So if we can tackle directly the energy  the same way we could tackle deforestation  maybe we can have a chance. So there are five things that I think we should do. First  we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions. We don't need to clear cut all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy. That's what we proved when we decreased deforestation and the economy continued to grow. Same thing could happen in the energy sector. Second  we have to move the incentives to the right place. Today      billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels. Why don't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy  Third  we need to measure and make it transparent where  when and who is emitting greenhouse gases so we can have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities. Fourth  we need to leapfrog the routes of development  which means  you don't need to go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones. Same way we don't need to go to fossil fuels to the one billion people who don't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy. And fifth and last  we need to share responsibility between governments  business and civil society. There is work to do for everybody  and we need to have everybody on board. So to finalize  I think the future is not like a fate that you have to just go as business as usual goes. We need to have the courage to actually change the route  invest in something new  think that we can actually change the route. I think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil  and I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world. Thank you. When you grow up in a developing country like India  as I did  you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources and find creative ways to reuse what you already have. Take Mansukh Prajapati  a potter in India. He has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity. He can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days. That's a cool invention  literally. In Africa  if you run out of your cell phone battery  don't panic. You will find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your  cell phone using bicycles. And since we are in South America  let's go to Lima in Peru  a region with high humidity that receives only one inch of rainfall each year. An engineering college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water  generating over    liters of water every day. The Peruvians are amazing. They can literally create water out of thin air. For the past seven years  I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in India  China  Africa and South America  and they keep amazing me. Many of them did not go to school. They don't invent stuff in big R D labs. The street is the lab. Why do they do that  Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted  like capital and energy  and basic services like healthcare and education are also scarce in those regions. When external resources are scarce  you have to go within yourself to tap the most abundant resource  human ingenuity  and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources. In India  we call it Jugaad. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix  a clever solution born in adversity. Jugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect  but they create more value at lower cost. For me  the entrepreneurs who will create Jugaad solutions are like alchemists. They can magically transform adversity into opportunity  and turn something of less value into something of high value. In other words  they mastered the art of doing more with less  which is the essence of frugal innovation. Frugal innovation is the ability  to create more economic and social value using fewer resources. Frugal innovation is not about making do  it's about making things better. Now I want to show you how  across emerging markets  entrepreneurs and companies are adopting  frugal innovation on a larger scale to cost effectively deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people who may have little income but very high aspirations. Let's first go to China  where the country's largest I.T. service provider  Neusoft  has developed a telemedicine solution to help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients in Chinese villages. This solution is based on simple to use medical devices that less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics. China desperately needs these frugal medical solutions because by      it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens. Now let's go to Kenya  a country where half the population uses M Pesa  a mobile payment solution. This is a great solution for the African continent because    percent of Africans don't have a bank account  but what is exciting is that M Pesa is now becoming the source of other disruptive business models in sectors like energy. Take M KOPA  the home solar solution that comes literally in a box that has a solar rooftop panel  three LED lights  a solar radio  and a cell phone charger. The whole kit  though  costs     dollars  which is too expensive for most Kenyans  and this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable. Today  you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just    dollars  and then pay off the rest by making a daily micro payment of    cents using your mobile phone. Once you've made     micro payments  the system is unlocked  and you own the product and you start  receiving clean  free electricity. This is an amazing solution for Kenya  where    percent of people live off the grid. This shows that with frugal innovation what matters is that you take what is most abundant  mobile connectivity  to deal with what is scarce  which is energy. With frugal innovation  the global South is actually catching up and in some cases  even leap frogging the North. Instead of building expensive hospitals  China is using telemedicine to cost effectively treat millions of patients  and Africa  instead of building banks and electricity grids  is going straight to mobile payments and distributed clean energy. Frugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the North. I live in Silicon Valley  where we keep chasing the next big technology thing. Think of the iPhone       then     . Companies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R D  and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products  to differentiate their brands from competition  and they charge customers more money for new features. So the conventional business model  in the West is more for more. But sadly  this more for more model is running out of gas  for three reasons  First  a big portion of customers in the West because of the diminishing purchasing power  can no longer afford these expensive products. Second  we are running out of natural water and oil. In California  where I live  water scarcity is becoming a big problem. And third  most importantly  because of the growing income disparity between the rich  and the middle class in the West  there is a big disconnect between existing products and services and basic needs of customers. Do you know that today  there are over    million Americans today who are underbanked  because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs. The prolonged economic crisis in the West is making people think that they are about to lose the high standard of living and face deprivation. I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West is if we learn to do more with less. The good news is  that's starting to happen. Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers. Let me give you two examples. When I first saw this building  I told myself it's some kind of postmodern house. Actually  it's a small manufacturing plant set up by Grameen Danone  a joint venture between  Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus and the food multinational Danone to make high quality yogurt in Bangladesh. This factory is    percent the size of existing Danone factories and cost much less to build. I guess you can call it a low fat factory. Now this factory  unlike Western factories that are highly automated  relies a lot on manual processes in order  to generate jobs for local communities. Danone was so inspired by this model that combines economic efficiency and social sustainability  they are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well. Now  when you see this example  you might be thinking   Well  frugal innovation is low tech.  Actually  no. Frugal innovation is also about making high tech more affordable and more accessible to more people. Let me give you an example. In China  the R D engineers of Siemens Healthcare have designed a C.T. scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers  like nurses and technicians. This device can scan more patients on a daily basis  and yet consumes less energy  which is great for hospitals  but it's also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by    percent and radiation dosage by up to    percent. This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market  but now it's selling like hotcakes in the U.S. and Europe  where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost. But the frugal innovation revolution in the West is actually led by creative entrepreneurs who are coming up with amazing solutions to address basic needs in the U.S. and Europe. Let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me. The first one happens to be launched by my neighbor in Silicon Valley. It's called gThrive. They make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers that farmers can stick in different parts of the field and start collecting detailed information like soil conditions. This dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields  which is a great solution for California  which faces major water shortage. It pays for itself within one year. Second example is Be Bound  also in Silicon Valley  that enables you to connect to the Internet even in no bandwidth areas where there's no wi fi or  G or  G. How do they do that  They simply use SMS  a basic technology  but that happens to be the most reliable and most widely available around the world. Three billion people today with  cell phones can't access the Internet. This solution can connect them to the Internet in a frugal way. And in France  there is a startup calle Compte Nickel  which is revolutionizing the banking sector. It allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products  an international bank account number and an international debit card. They charge a flat annual  maintenance fee of just    Euros. That means you can do all banking transactions    send and receive money  pay with your debit card    all with no additional charge. This is what I call low cost banking without the bank. Amazingly     percent of the customers using this service are the middle class French who can't afford high banking fees. Now  I talked about frugal innovation  initially pioneered in the South  now being adopted in the North. Ultimately  we would like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity. The exciting news is that's starting to happen. Let's go to Nairobi to find that out. Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams. When I first saw them  I thought   Holy cow.  Literally  because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi. To ease the situation  the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic  which initially was designed by the Japanese engineers. Unlike in the West  Megaffic doesn't rely on roadside sensors  which are very expensive to install in Nairobi. Instead they process images  traffic data  collected from a small number of low resolution webcams in Nairobi streets  and then they use analytic software to predict congestion points  and they can SMS drivers alternate routes to take. Granted  Megaffic is not as sexy as self driving cars  but it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B at least    percent faster. And earlier this year  UCLA Health launched its Global Lab for Innovation  which seeks to identify frugal healthcare  solutions anywhere in the world that will be at least    percent cheaper than existing solutions in the U.S. and yet more effective. It also tries to bring together innovators from North and South to cocreate affordable healthcare solutions for all of humanity. I gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world  but the question is  how do you go about adopting frugal innovation  Well  I gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world that I want to share with you that you can apply in your own organization to do more with less. The first principle is  Keep it simple. Don't create solutions to impress customers. Make them easy enough to use and widely accessible  like the C.T. scanner we saw in China. Second principle   Do not reinvent the wheel. Try to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available  like using mobile telephony to offer clean energy or Mom and Pop stores to offer banking services. Third principle is  Think and act horizontally. Companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses  but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity  you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units  like Grameen Bank has shown. The South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity. The North is now learning to do more and better with less as it faces resource constraints. As an Indian born French national who lives in the United States  my hope is that we transcend this artificial North South divide so that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to cocreate frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world  while preserving our precious planet. Thank you very much. Let's go south. All of you are actually going south. This is the direction of south  this way  and if you go       kilometers out of the back of this room  you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth  the Pole itself. Now  I am not an explorer. I'm not an environmentalist. I'm actually just a survivor  and these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous. They are the ice melt of the South and North Poles. And ladies and gentlemen  we need to listen to what these places are telling us  and if we don't  we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet Earth. I have faced head on these places  and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing that's ever happened to me. Antarctica is such a hopeful place. It is protected by  the Antarctic Treaty  signed in     . In       a    year agreement was entered into that stops any exploitation in Antarctica  and this agreement could be altered  changed  modified  or even abandoned starting in the year     . Ladies and gentlemen  people already far up north from here in the Arctic are already taking advantage of this ice melt  taking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice for the last                         years. Can they not join the dots and think   Why is the ice actually melting   This is such an amazing place  the Antarctic  and I have worked hard for the last    years on this mission to make sure that what's happening up here in the North does never happen   cannot happen in the South. Where did this all begin  It began for me at the age of   . Check out that haircut.  It's a bit odd.  Laughter  And at the age of      I was inspired by the real explorers to want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles. I found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls  at parties when I was at university. That was a bit more inspiring. And after years  seven years of fundraising  seven years of being told no  seven years of being told by my family to seek counseling and psychiatric help  eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on Earth in history. In this photograph  we are standing in an area the size of the United States of America  and we're on our own. We have no radio  communications  no backup. Beneath our feet     percent of all the world's ice     percent of all the world's fresh water. We're standing on it. This is the power of Antarctica. On this journey  we faced the danger of crevasses  intense cold  so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing  your teeth can crack  water can freeze in your eyes. Let's just say it's a bit chilly.  Laughter  And after    desperate days  we arrive at the South Pole. We had done it. But something happened to me on that    day journey in      that brought me here  and it hurt. My eyes changed color in    days through damage. Our faces blistered out. The skin ripped off and we wondered why. And when we got home  we were told by NASA that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the South Pole  and we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered. Ultraviolet rays down  hit the ice  bounced back  fried out the eyes  ripped off our faces. It was a bit of a shock     Laughter     and it started me thinking. In       we now head north. Sixty days  every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean. It was desperately cold again. Here's me coming in from washing naked at     Celsius. And if anybody ever says to you   I am cold      Laughter     if they look like this   they are cold  definitely. And       kilometers away from the safety of land  disaster strikes. The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history  and we're       kilometers from safety. The ice is crashing around us  grinding  and I'm thinking   Are we going to die   But something clicked in my head on this day  as I realized we  as a world  are in a survival situation  and that feeling has never gone away for    long years. Back then  we had to march or die. And we're not some TV survivor program. When things go wrong for us  it's life or death  and our brave African American Daryl  who would become the first American to walk to the North Pole  his heel dropped off  from frostbite     klicks out. He must keep going  he does  and after    days on the ice  we stood at the North Pole. We had done it. Yes  I became the first person in history stupid enough to walk to both Poles  but it was our success. And sadly  on return home  it was not all fun. I became very low. To succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen. I was empty  lonely  financially destroyed. I was without hope  but hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau  and he inspired me to take on  the      mission. Being Jacques  he gave me clear instructions  Engage the world leaders  talk to industry and business  and above all  Rob  inspire young people  because they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica. For the world leaders  we've been to every world Earth Summit  all three of them  with our brave yacht        twice to Rio  once in '    once in       and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg  we made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht         kilometers around the whole of Southern Africa doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person about      and about their environment. For the last    years  we have taken over       people  people from industry and business  women and men from companies  students from all over the world  down to Antarctica  and during those missions  we've managed to pull out over       tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica. That took eight years  and I'm so proud of it because we recycled all of it  back here in South America. I have been inspired ever since I could walk to recycle by my mum. Here she is  and my mum    my mum is still recycling  and as she is in her    th year  isn't that fantastic  And when    I love my mum. But when Mum was born  the population of our planet was only  .  billion people  and talking in terms of billions  we have taken young people from industry and business from India  from China. These are game changing nations  and will be hugely important in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic. Unbelievably  we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East  often for the first time they've  represented their nations in Antarctica. Fantastic people  so inspired. To look after Antarctica  you've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place  form a relationship  form a bond  form some love. It is such a privilege to go to Antarctica  I can't tell you. I feel so lucky  and I've been    times in my life  and all those people who come with us return home as great champions  not only for Antarctica  but for local issues back in their own nations. Let's go back to where we began  the ice melt of the North and South Poles. And it's not good news. NASA informed us six months ago that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf is now disintegrating. Huge areas of ice    look how big Antarctica is even compared to here    Huge areas of ice  are breaking off from Antarctica  the size of small nations. And NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise  it is definite  by one meter in the next     years  the same time that my mum has been on planet Earth. It's going to happen  and I've realized that  the preservation of Antarctica and our survival here on Earth are linked. And there is a very simple solution. If we are using more renewable energy in the real world  if we are being more efficient with the energy here  running our energy mix in a cleaner way  there will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica. It won't make financial sense  and if we manage our energy better  we also may be able to slow down  maybe even stop  this great ice melt that threatens us. It's a big challenge  and what is our response to it  We've got to go back one last time  and at the end of next year  we will go back to the South Geographic Pole  where we arrived    years ago on foot  and retrace our steps of       kilometers  but this time only using renewable energy to survive. We will walk across those icecaps  which far down below are melting  hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue. This is my son  Barney. He is coming with me. He is committed to walking side by side with his father  and what he will do is to translate these messages and inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders. I'm extremely proud of him. Good on him  Barney. Ladies and gentlemen   a survivor    and I'm good    a survivor sees a problem and doesn't go   Whatever.  A survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem before it becomes a threat. We have    years to preserve the Antarctic. We all own it. We all have responsibility. The fact that nobody owns it  maybe means that we can succeed. Antarctica is a moral line in the snow  and on one side of that line we should fight  fight hard for this one beautiful  pristine place left alone on Earth. I know it's possible. We are going to do it. And I'll leave you with these words from Goethe. I've tried to live by them.  If you can do  or dream you can  begin it now  for boldness has genius  power and magic in it.  Good luck to you all. Thank you very much. We can cut violent deaths around the world by    percent in the next three decades. All we have to do is drop killing by  .  percent a year  and we'll hit that target. You don't believe me  Well  the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world seem to think we can  and so do I  but only if we focus on our cities  especially the most fragile ones. You see  I've been thinking about this a lot. For the last    years  I've been working in countries and cities ripped apart by conflict  violence  terrorism  or some insidious combination of all. I've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia  I've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo  I've counted cadavers in Colombia  in  Haiti  in Sri Lanka  in Papua New Guinea. You don't need to be on the front line  though  to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control  right  There's this feeling that international instability is the new normal. But I want you to take a closer look  and I think you'll see that the geography of violence is changing  because it's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime as our cities  Aleppo  Bamako  Caracas   Erbil  Mosul  Tripoli  Salvador. Violence is migrating to the metropole. And maybe this is to be expected  right  After all  most people today  they live in cities  not the countryside. Just     cities  including    megacities  account for two thirds of global GDP. But when it comes to cities  the conversation is dominated by the North  that is  North America  Western Europe  Australia and Japan  where violence is  actually at historic lows. As a result  city enthusiasts  they talk about the triumph of the city  of the creative classes  and the mayors that will rule the world. Now  I hope that mayors do one day rule the world  but  you know  the fact is  we don't hear any conversation  really  about what is happening in the South. And by South  I mean Latin America  Africa  Asia  where violence in some cases is accelerating  where infrastructure is overstretched  and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality. Now  some diplomats and development experts and specialists  they talk about    to    fragile states that will shape security in the   st century. I think it's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder. That's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities  and the fight for development  whether you define that as eradicating poverty  universal healthcare  beating back climate change  will be won or lost in the shantytowns  slums and favelas of our cities. I want to talk to you about four megarisks that I think will define fragility in our time  and if we can get to grips with these  I think we can do something with that lethal violence problem. So let me start with some good news. Fact is  we're living in the most peaceful moment in human history. Steven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all time low. Now  Gaza  Syria  Sudan  Ukraine  as ghastly as these conflicts are  and they are horrific  they represent a relatively small blip upwards in a    year long secular decline. What's more  we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide. Manuel Eisner and others have shown that for centuries  we've seen this incredible drop in murder  especially in the West. Most Northern cities today are     times safer than they were just     years ago. These two facts    the decline in armed  conflict and the decline in murder    are amongst the most extraordinary  if unheralded  accomplishments of human history  and we should be really excited  right  Well  yeah  we should. There's just one problem  These two scourges are still with us. You see          people    men  women  boys and girls    die violently every single year. Research I've been doing with Keith Krause and others has shown that between        and        people are dying in war zones violently. The rest  almost         people  are dying outside of conflict zones. In other words     times more people are dying outside of war than inside war. What's more  violence is moving south  to Latin America and the Caribbean  to parts of Central and Southern Africa  and to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia. Forty of the    most dangerous  cities in the world are right here in Latin America     in Brazil  and the most dangerous of all  it's  San Pedro Sula  Honduras' second city  with a staggering homicide rate of     murders per         people. That's    times the global average. Now  if violence is re concentrating geographically  it's also being reconfigured to the world's new topography  because when it comes to cities  the world ain't flat  like Thomas Friedman likes to say. It's spiky. The dominance of the city as the primary mode of urban living is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history  and it all happened so fast. You all know the figures  right  There's  .  billion people in the world today  there will be  .  billion by     . But consider this one fact  In the     s  one in    people lived in cities  today it's one in two  and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there. And this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable. The vast majority     percent  will be happening in the South  in cities of the South. So urban geographers and demographers  they tell us that it's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence  no. Tokyo  with    million people  is one of the largest  and some might say safest  urban metropolises in the world. No  it's the speed of urbanization that matters. I call this turbo urbanization  and it's  one of the key drivers of fragility. When you think about the incredible expansion of these cities  and you think about turbo urbanization  think about Karachi. Karachi was about         people in       a hustling  bustling city. Today  it's    million people  and apart from accounting for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP  it's also one of the most violent cities in South Asia. Dhaka  Lagos  Kinshasa  these cities are now    times larger than they were in the     s. Now take a look at New York. The Big Apple  it took     years to get to eight million people. S o Paulo  Mexico City  took    to reach that same interval. Now  what do these medium  large  mega   and hypercities look like  What is their profile  Well  for one thing  they're young. What we're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge. Now  this is actually a good news story. It's a function of reductions in child mortality rates. But the youth bulge is something we've got to watch. What it basically means is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities is much larger than those living  in our healthier and wealthier ones. In some fragile cities     percent of the population is under the age of   . Think about that  Three in four people are under   . It's like Palo Alto on steroids. Now  if you look at Mogadishu for example  in Mogadishu the mean age is    years old. Ditto for Dhaka  Dili and Kabul. And Tokyo  It's   . Same for most Western European cities. Now  it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence. That's one factor among many  but youthfulness combined with unemployment  lack of education  and    this is the kicker     being male  is a deadly proposition. They're statistically correlated  all those risk factors  with youth  and they tend to relate to increases in violence. Now  for those of you who are parents of teenage sons  you know what I'm talking about  right  Just imagine your boy without any structure with those unruly friends of his  out there cavorting about. Now  take away the parents  take away the education  limit the education possibilities  sprinkle in a little bit of drugs  alcohol and guns  and sit back and watch the fireworks. The implications are disconcerting. Right here in Brazil  the life expectancy is   .  years. If you live in Rio  I'm sorry  shave off two right there. But if you're young  you're uneducated  you lack employment  you're black  and you're male  your life expectancy drops to less than    years old. There's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country. Okay  so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities. After all  cities are hubs of innovation  dynamism  prosperity   excitement  connectivity. They're where the smart people gather. And those young people I just mentioned  they're more digitally savvy and tech aware than ever before. And this explosion  the Internet  and mobile technology  means that the digital divide separating the North and the South between countries and within them  is shrinking. But as we've heard so many times  these new technologies are dual edged  right  Take the case of law enforcement. Police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data to anticipate crime. Some cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens. The future crime scenario  it's here today  and we've got to be careful. We have to manage the issues of the public safety against rights to individual privacy. But it's not just the cops who are innovating. We've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups who are engaging in local  and global collective action  and this is leading to digital protest and real revolution. But most worrying of all are criminal gangs who are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace. In Ciudad Ju rez in Mexico  where I've been working  groups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel are hijacking social media. They're using it to recruit  to sell their products  to coerce  to intimidate and to kill. Violence is going virtual. So this is just a partial sketch of a fast moving and dynamic and complex situation. I mean  there are many other megarisks that are going to define fragility in our time  not least income inequality  poverty  climate change  impunity. But we're facing a stark dilemma where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards. If we're going to change course  we need to start a conversation. We can't only focus on those cities that work  the Singapores  the Kuala Lumpurs  the Dubais  the Shanghais. We've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation. One way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones  kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices  of what works and what doesn't. A wonderful example of this is coming from El Salvador and Los Angeles  where the mayors in San Salvador and Los Angeles are collaborating on getting ex gang members to work with current gang members  offering tutoring  education  and in the process are helping incubate cease fires and truces  and we've seen homicide rates go down in San Salvador  once the world's most violent city  by    percent. We can also focus  on hot cities  but also hot spots. Place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities. Did you know that between one and two percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to    percent of violent crime  Take the case of S o Paulo  where I've been working. It's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest  and it did this by doubling down on information collection  hot spot mapping  and police reform  and in the process  it dropped homicide by    percent in just over    years. We also got to focus on those hot people. It's tragic  but being young  unemployed  uneducated  male  increases the risks of being killed and killing. We have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children  our youngest children  and valorize them  not stigmatize them. There's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with in Kingston  Jamaica and right here in Rio  which is putting education  employment  recreation up front for these high risk groups  and as a result  we're seeing violence going down in their communities. We've also got to make our cities safer  more inclusive  and livable for all. The fact is  social cohesion matters. Mobility matters in our cities. We've got to get away from this model of segregation  exclusion  and cities with walls. My favorite example of how to do this comes from Medell n. When I lived in Colombia in the late     s  Medell n was the murder capital  of the world  but it changed course  and it did this by deliberately investing in its low income and most violent areas and integrating them with the middle class ones through a network of cable cars  of public transport  and first class infrastructure  and in the process  it dropped homicide by    percent in just under two decades. And finally  there's technology. Technology has enormous promise but also peril. We've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation  and much of it coming from this room  The police are engaging  in predictive analytics. Citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions. Even my own group is involved in developing applications to provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens. But we need to be careful. If I have one single message for you  it's this  There is nothing inevitable about lethal violence  and we can make our cities safer. Folks  we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime. So I have just one question  What are we waiting for  Thank you. It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back. The first time I visited the prison  I was not surprised by the noise of the padlocks  or the closing doors  or the cell bars  or by any of the things I had imagined. Maybe because the prison is in a quite open space. You can see the sky. Seagulls fly overhead  and you feel like you're next to the sea  that you're really close to the beach. But in fact  the gulls are looking for food in the dump near the prison. I went farther inside and I suddenly saw inmates moving across the corridors. Then it was as if I stepped back and thought that I could have very well been one of them. If I had another story  another context  different luck. Because nobody   nobody   can choose where they're born. In       I was invited to join a project that San Mart n National University conducted at the Unit    penitentiary  to coordinate a writing workshop. The prison service ceded some land at the end of the prison  which is where they constructed the University Center building. The first time I met with the prisoners  I asked them why they were asking for a writing workshop and they told me they wanted  to put on paper all that they couldn't say and do. Right then I decided that I wanted poetry to enter the prison. So I said to them why don't we work with poetry  if they knew what poetry was. But nobody had a clue what poetry really was. They also suggested to me that the workshop should be not just for the inmates taking university classes   but for all the inmates. And so I said that to start this workshop  I needed to find a tool that we all had in common. That tool was language. We had language  we had the workshop. We could have poetry. But what I hadn't considered was that inequality exists in prison  too. Many of the prisoners hadn't even completed grammar school. Many couldn't use cursive  could barely print. They didn't write fluently  either. So we started looking for short poems. Very short  but very powerful. And we started to read  and we'd read one author  then another author  and by reading such short poems  they all began to realize that what the poetic language did was to break a certain logic  and create another system. Breaking the logic of language also breaks the logic of the system under which they've learned to respond. So a new system appeared  new rules that made them understand very quickly    very quickly   that with poetic language they would be able to say absolutely whatever they wanted. It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back. And they have plenty of hell. Plenty of hell. One of them once said   In prison you never sleep. You can never sleep in jail. You can never close your eyelids.  And so  like I m doing now  I gave them a moment of silence  then said   That's what poetry is  you guys. It's in this prison universe that you have all around you. Everything you say about how you never sleep  it exudes fear. All the things that go unwritten    all of that is poetry.  So we started appropriating that hell  we plunged ourselves  headfirst  into the seventh circle. And in that seventh circle of hell  our very own  beloved circle  they learned that they could make the walls invisible  that they could make the windows yell  and that we could hide inside the shadows. When the first year of the workshop had ended  we organized a little closing party  like you do when a job is done with so much love  and you want to celebrate with a party. We called family  friends   the university authorities. The only thing the inmates had to do was read a poem  and receive their diplomas and applause. That was our simple party. The only thing I want to leave you with is the moment in which those men  some of them just huge when standing next to me  or the young boys   so young  but with an enormous pride  held their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated  and read their poems with their voices completely broken. That moment made me think a lot that for most of them  it was surely the very first time that someone applauded them for something they had done. In prison there are things that can't be done. In prison  you can't dream. In prison  you can't cry. There are words that are virtually forbidden  like the word  time   the word  future   the word  wish . But we dared to dream  and to dream a lot. We decided that they were going to write a book. Not only did they write a book  but they also bound it themselves. That was at the end of     . Then  we doubled the bet and wrote another book. And we bound that one  too. That was a short time ago  at the end of last year. What I see week after week  is how they're turning into different people  how they're being transformed. How words are empowering them with a dignity they had never known  that they couldn't even imagine. They had no idea such dignity could come from them. At the workshop  in that beloved hell we share  we all give something. We open our hands and hearts and give what we have  what we can. All of us  all of us equally. And so you feel that at least in a small way you're repairing that huge social fracture which makes it so that for many of them  prison is their only destination. I remember a verse by a tremendous poet  a great poet  from our Unit    workshop  Nicol s Dorado   I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound.  Poetry does that  it sews up the wounds of exclusion. It opens doors.  Poetry works as a mirror. It creates a mirror  which is the poem. They recognize themselves  they look at themselves in the poem and write from who they are  and are from what they write. In order to write  they need to appropriate the moment of writing which is a moment of extraordinary freedom. They have to get into their heads  search for that bit of freedom that can never be taken away when they write and that is also useful to realize that freedom is possible even inside a prison  and that the only bars we have in our wonderful space is the word  bars   and that all of us in our hell burn with happiness when we light the wick of the word. I told you a lot about the prison  a lot about what I experience every week  and how I enjoy it and transform myself with the inmates. But you don't know how much I'd like it if you could feel  live  experience  even for a few seconds  what I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am. Mart n Bustamante   The heart chews tears of time  blinded by that light  it hides the speed of existence where the images go rowing by. It fights  it hangs on. The heart cracks under sad gazes  rides on storms that spread fire  lifts chests lowered by shame  knows that it's not just reading and going on  it also wishes to see the infinite blue. The heart sits down to think about things  fights to avoid being ordinary  tries to love without hurting  breathes the sun  giving courage to itself  surrenders  travels toward reason. The heart fights among the swamps  skirts the edge of the underworld  falls exhausted  but won't give in to what's easy  while irregular steps of intoxication wake up  wake the stillness. I'm Mart n Bustamante  I'm a prisoner in Unit    of San Mart n  today is my day of temporary release. And for me  poetry and literature have changed my life. Thank you very much  Cristina Domenech  Thank you  So we humans have an extraordinary potential for goodness  but also an immense power to do harm. Any tool can be used to build or to destroy. That all depends on our motivation. Therefore  it is all the more important to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one. So now we indeed are facing  many challenges in our times. Those could be personal challenges. Our own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy. There's also societal challenges  poverty in the midst of plenty  inequalities  conflict  injustice. And then there are the new challenges  which we don't expect. Ten thousand years ago  there were about five million human beings on Earth. Whatever they could do  the Earth's resilience  would soon heal human activities. After the Industrial and Technological Revolutions  that's not the same anymore. We are now the major agent of impact on our Earth. We enter the Anthropocene  the era of human beings. So in a way  if we were to say we need to continue this endless growth  endless use of material resources  it's like if this man was saying    and I heard a former head of state  I won't mention who  saying     Five years ago  we were at the edge of the precipice. Today we made a big step forward.  So this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists as the planetary boundaries. And within those boundaries  they can carry a number of factors. We can still prosper  humanity can still prosper for         years if we keep the same stability of climate as in the Holocene for the last        years. But this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity  growing qualitatively  not quantitatively. So in       as you can see  we were well within the limits of safety. Now  in      came the great acceleration. Now hold your breath  not too long  to imagine what comes next. Now we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries. Just to take biodiversity   at the current rate  by          percent of all species  on Earth will have disappeared. Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge  that's not going to be reversible. So here I am sitting in front of a       meter high          foot glacier in Bhutan. At the Third Pole        glaciers are melting fast  faster than the Arctic. So what can we do in that situation  Well  however complex politically  economically  scientifically the question of the environment is  it simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness. I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency. Groucho Marx said   Why should I care about future generations  What have they ever done for me   Unfortunately  I heard the billionaire Steve Forbes  on Fox News  saying exactly  the same thing  but seriously. He was told about the rise of the ocean  and he said   I find it absurd to change my behavior today for something that will happen  in a hundred years.  So if you don't care for future generations  just go for it. So one of the main challenges of our times is to reconcile three time scales  the short term of the economy  the ups and downs of the stock market  the end of the year accounts  the midterm of the quality of life    what is the quality every moment of our  life  over    years and    years     and the long term of the environment. When the environmentalists speak with economists  it's like a schizophrenic dialogue  completely incoherent. They don't speak the same language. Now  for the last    years  I went around the world meeting economists  scientists  neuroscientists  environmentalists  philosophers  thinkers  in the Himalayas  all over the place. It seems to me  there's only one concept that can reconcile those three time scales. It is simply having more consideration for others. If you have more consideration for others  you will have a caring economics  where finance is at the service of society and not society at the service of finance. You will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with. If you have more consideration for others  you will make sure that you remedy inequality  that you bring some kind  of well being within society  in education  at the workplace. Otherwise  a nation that is the most powerful and the richest but everyone is miserable  what's the point  And if you have more consideration for others  you are not going to ransack that planet that we have and at the current rate  we don't have three planets to continue that way. So the question is  okay  altruism is the answer  it's not just a novel ideal  but can it be a real  pragmatic solution  And first of all  does it exist  true altruism  or are we so selfish  So some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish. But are we really all just like rascals  That's good news  isn't it  Many philosophers   like Hobbes  have said so. But not everyone looks like a rascal. Or is man a wolf for man  But this guy doesn't seem too bad. He's one of my friends in Tibet. He's very kind. So now  we love cooperation. There's no better joy  than working together  is there  And then not only humans. Then  of course  there's the struggle for life  the survival of the fittest  social Darwinism. But in evolution  cooperation    though competition exists  of course    cooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity. We are super cooperators  and we should even go further. So now  on top of that  the quality of human relationships. The OECD did a survey among    factors  including income  everything. The first one that people said  that's the main thing for my happiness  is quality of social relationships. Not only in humans. And look at those great grandmothers. So now  this idea  that if we go deep within  we are irredeemably selfish  this is armchair science. There is not a single sociological study  psychological study  that's ever shown that. Rather  the opposite. My friend  Daniel Batson   spent a whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations. And of course we are sometimes selfish  and some people more than others. But he found that systematically  no matter what  there's a significant number of people who do behave altruistically  no matter what. If you see someone deeply wounded  great suffering  you might just help out of empathic distress    you can't stand it  so it's better to help than to keep on looking at that person. So we tested all that  and in the end   he said  clearly people can be altruistic. So that's good news. And even further  we should look at the banality of goodness. Now look at here. When we come out  we aren't  going to say   That's so nice. There was no fistfight while this mob  was thinking about altruism.  No  that's expected  isn't it  If there was a fistfight  we would speak of that for months. So the banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention  but it exists. Now  look at this. So some psychologists said  when I tell them I run     humanitarian  projects in the Himalayas that give me so much joy  they said   Oh  I see  you work for the warm glow. That is not altruistic. You just feel good.  You think this guy  when he jumped in front of the train  he thought   I'm going to feel so good when this is over   But that's not the end of it. They say  well  but when you interviewed him  he said   I had no choice. I had to jump  of course.  He has no choice. Automatic behavior. It's neither selfish nor altruistic. No choice  Well of course  this guy's not going to think for half an hour   Should I give my hand  Not give my hand   He does it. There is a choice  but it's obvious  it's immediate. And then  also  there he had a choice. There are people who had choice  like Pastor Andr  Trocm  and his wife  and the whole village of Le Chambon sur Lignon in France. For the whole Second World War  they saved       Jews  gave them shelter  brought them to Switzerland  against all odds  at the risk of their lives and those of their family. So altruism does exist. So what is altruism  It is the wish  May others be happy and find the cause of happiness. Now  empathy is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you  this person is joyful  this person suffers. But empathy alone is not sufficient. If you keep on being confronted with suffering  you might have empathic distress  burnout  so you need the greater sphere of loving kindness. With Tania Singer at the Max Planck  Institute of Leipzig  we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving kindness are different. Now  that's all well done  so we got that from evolution  from maternal care  parental love  but we need to extend that. It can be extended even to other species. Now  if we want a more altruistic society  we need two things  individual change and societal change. So is individual change possible  Two thousand years of contemplative study said yes  it is. Now     years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics said yes  our brains change when you train in altruism. So I spent     hours in an MRI machine. This is the first time I went after two and a half hours. And then the result has been published in many scientific papers. It shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love. Just to give you an idea  this is the meditator at rest on the left  meditator in compassion meditation  you see all the activity  and then the control group at rest  nothing happened  in meditation  nothing happened. They have not been trained. So do you need        hours  of meditation  No  you don't. Four weeks     minutes a day  of caring  mindfulness meditation already brings a structural change in the brain compared to a control group. That's only    minutes a day for four weeks. Even with preschoolers    Richard Davidson did that in Madison. An eight week program  gratitude  loving  kindness  cooperation  mindful breathing. You would say    Oh  they're just preschoolers.  Look after eight weeks  the pro social behavior  that's the blue line. And then comes the ultimate scientific test  the stickers test. Before  you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class  their least favorite child  an unknown child  and the sick child  and they have to give stickers away. So before the intervention  they give most of it to their best friend. Four  five years old      minutes three times a week. After the intervention  no more discrimination  the same amount of stickers to their  best friend and the least favorite child. That's something we should do in all the schools in the world. Now where do we go from there  When the Dalai Lama heard that  he told Richard Davidson   You go to    schools      schools  the U.N.  the whole world.  So now where do we go from there  Individual change is possible. Now do we have to wait for an altruistic  gene to be in the human race  That will take        years  too much for the environment. Fortunately  there is the evolution of culture. Cultures  as specialists have shown  change faster than genes. That's the good news. Look  attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years. So now individual change and cultural  change mutually fashion each other  and yes  we can achieve a more altruistic society. So where do we go from there  Myself  I will go back to the East. Now we treat         patients a year in our projects. We have        kids in school  four percent overhead. Some people say   Well  your stuff works in practice  but does it work in theory   There's always positive deviance. So I will also go back to my hermitage to find the inner resources to better serve others. But on the more global level  what can we do  We need three things. Enhancing cooperation  Cooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning  Unconditional cooperation within corporations    there can be some competition between corporations  but not within. We need sustainable harmony. I love this term. Not sustainable growth anymore. Sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality. In the future  we do more with less  and we continue to grow qualitatively  not quantitatively. We need caring economics. The Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty  cannot deal with the problem of the common goods of the atmosphere  of the oceans. We need a caring economics. If you say economics should be compassionate  they say   That's not our job.  But if you say they don't care  that looks bad. We need local commitment  global responsibility. We need to extend altruism to the other  .  million species. Sentient beings  are co citizens in this world. and we need to dare altruism. So  long live the altruistic revolution. Viva la revoluci n de altruismo. Thank you. My students and I work on very tiny robots. Now  you can think of these as robotic versions of something that you're all very familiar with  an ant. We all know that ants and other insects at this size scale can do some pretty incredible things. We've all seen a group of ants  or some version of that  carting off your potato chip at a picnic  for example. But what are the real challenges of engineering these ants  Well  first of all  how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale  Well  first we need to figure out how to make them move when they're so small. We need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion  and we need the sensors  power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi intelligent ant robot. And finally  to make these things really functional  we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things. So I'll start with mobility. Insects move around amazingly well. This video is from UC Berkeley. It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over  and it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials  which is what we traditionally use to make robots  and soft materials. Jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you're very small. So these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water  for example. So one of the big contributions from my lab has been to combine rigid and soft materials in very  very small mechanisms. So this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side  so really tiny. The hard material here is silicon  and the soft material is silicone rubber. And the basic idea is that we're going to compress this  store energy in the springs  and then release it to jump. So there's no motors on board this right now  no power. This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab  graduate student with tweezers.   Laughter  So what you'll see in the next video is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps. So this is Aaron  the graduate student in question  with the tweezers  and what you see is this  four millimeter sized mechanism jumping almost    centimeters high. That's almost     times its own length. And it survives  bounces on the table  it's incredibly robust  and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it's very tiny. Ultimately  though  we want to add motors to this too  and we have students in the lab working on millimeter sized motors to eventually integrate onto small  autonomous robots. But in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start  we're cheating and using magnets. So this shows what would eventually be part of a micro robot leg  and you can see the silicone rubber joints and there's an embedded magnet that's being moved around by an external magnetic field. So this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier. The really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out is how insects move at this scale. We have a really good model for how everything from a cockroach up to an elephant moves. We all move in this  kind of bouncy way when we run. But when I'm really small   the forces between my feet and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass  which is what causes that bouncy motion. So this guy doesn't work quite yet  but we do have slightly larger versions that do run around. So this is about a centimeter cubed  a centimeter on a side  so very tiny  and we've gotten this to run about    body lengths per second  so    centimeters per second. It's pretty quick for a little  small guy  and that's really only limited  by our test setup. But this gives you some idea of how it works right now. We can also make  D printed versions  of this that can climb over obstacles  a lot like the cockroach that you saw earlier. But ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot. We want sensing  power  control  actuation all together  and not everything needs to be bio inspired. So this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac. And in this case  instead of magnets or muscles to move this around  we use rockets. So this is a micro fabricated energetic material  and we can create tiny pixels of this  and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot  and this robot  then  is going to jump when it senses an increase in light. So the next video is one of my favorites. So you have this     milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air. It's only four by four by seven millimeters in size. And you'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off  and the robot tumbling through the air. So there was that big flash  and you can see the robot jumping up through the air. So there's no tethers on this  no wires connecting to this. Everything is onboard  and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it. So I think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do with robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale. Imagine the rubble that you get after  a natural disaster like an earthquake. Imagine these small robots running through that rubble to look for survivors. Or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge in order to inspect it and make sure it's safe so you don't get collapses like this  which happened outside of  Minneapolis in     . Or just imagine what you could do if you had robots that could swim through your blood. Right   Fantastic Voyage   Isaac Asimov. Or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place. Or we could radically change the way we build things if we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do  and they build these incredible eight meter high mounds  effectively well ventilated apartment buildings for other termites in Africa and Australia. So I think I've given you some of the possibilities of what we can do with these small robots. And we've made some advances so far  but there's still a long way to go  and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination. Thanks very much. It is very fashionable and proper  to speak about food in all its forms  all its colors   aromas and tastes. But after the food goes through  the digestive system  when it is thrown out as crap  it is no longer fashionable to speak about it. It is rather revolting. I'm a guy who has graduated  from bullshit to full shit. My organization  Gram Vikas  which means  village development organization   was working in the area  of renewable energy. On the most part  we were  producing biogas  biogas for rural kitchens. We produce biogas in India  by using animal manure  which usually  in India   is called cow dung. But as the gender sensitive  person that I am  I would like to call it bullshit. But realizing later on how important were sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way  we went into the arena of sanitation. Eighty percent of all diseases  in India and most developing countries are because of poor quality water. And when we look at the reason  for poor quality water  you find that it is our abysmal attitude  to the disposal of human waste. Human waste  in its rawest form  finds its way back to drinking water  bathing water  washing water  irrigation water  whatever water you see. And this is the cause for    percent  of the diseases in rural areas. In India  it is unfortunately only the women who carry water. So for all domestic needs  women have to carry water. So that is a pitiable state of affairs. Open defecation is rampant. Seventy percent of India defecates in the open. They sit there out in the open  with the wind on their sails  hiding their faces  exposing their bases  and sitting there in pristine glory       percent of India. And if you look at the world total     percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by Indians. A fantastic distinction. I don't know if we Indians can be proud of such a distinction. So we  together with a lot of villages  we began to talk about how to really  address this situation of sanitation. And we came together and formed  a project called MANTRA. MANTRA stands for Movement and Action Network for Transformation of Rural Areas. So we are speaking about transformation  transformation in rural areas. Villages that agree  to implement this project  they organize a legal society where the general body  consists of all members who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and  later on  who look after the operation and maintenance. They decide to build a toilet  and a shower room. And from a protected water source  water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households through three taps  one in the toilet  one in the shower   one in the kitchen     hours a day. The pity is that our cities  like New Delhi and Bombay  do not have a    hour water supply. But in these villages  we want to have it. There is a distinct difference  in the quality. Well in India  we have a theory  which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter  that poor people deserve poor solutions and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions. This  combined with  a Nobel Prize worthy theory that the cheapest is the most economic  is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink. We are fighting against this. We feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries. And even in sanitation  they should not be humiliated. Sanitation is more about dignity than about human disposal of waste. And so you build these toilets  and very often  we have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses. And you can see that in front are  the attached houses and the others are the toilets. So these people  without a single exception of a family in a village  decide to build a toilet  a bathing room. And for that  they come together  collect all the local materials    local materials like rubble   sand  aggregates  usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost  of external materials like cement  steel  toilet commode. And they build a toilet  and a bathing room. Also  all the unskilled laborers  that is  daily wage earners  mostly landless  are given an opportunity to be  trained as masons and plumbers. So while these people are being trained   others are collecting the materials. And when both are ready  they build a toilet  a shower room  and of course also a water tower   an elevated water reservoir. We use a system of two leach pits  to treat the waste. From the toilet  the muck comes into the first leach pit. And when it is full  it is blocked  and it can go to the next. But we discovered that if you plant banana trees  papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits  they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get very tasty bananas  papayas. If any of you come to my place  I would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you. So there you can see  the completed toilets  the water towers. This is in a village where  most of the people are even illiterate. It is always a    hour water supply because water gets polluted very often when you store it    a child dips his or her hand into it  something falls into it. So no water is stored. It's always on tap. This is how an elevated  water reservoir is constructed. And that is the end product. Because it has to go high  and there is some space available  two or three rooms are made under the water tower  which are used by the village for  different committee meetings. We have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program. Before we started  there were  as usual  more than    percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases. But after this  we have empirical evidence that    percent  on average  among all these villages          villages have completed it    waterborne diseases  have come down    percent. Women usually used to spend   especially in the summer months  about six to seven hours  a day carrying water. And when they went to carry water  because  as I said earlier  it's only women who carry water  they used to take their little children  girl children  also to carry water  or else to be back at home to look after the siblings. So there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school  even if there was a school. And boys  about    percent. But girls  it has gone to about    percent and boys  almost to     percent. The most vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage earners. Because they have gone  through this training to be masons and plumbers and bar benders  now their ability to earn has  increased     to     percent. So this is a democracy in action because there is a general body   a governing board  the committee. People are questioning   people are governing themselves  people are learning to manage their own affairs  they are taking their own futures into their hands. And that is democracy at the grassroots level in action. More than       villages  have so far done this. It benefits over         people and it's still going on. And I hope it continues to move ahead. For India and such developing countries  armies and armaments  software companies and spaceships may not be as important as taps and toilets. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I was young  I prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative U.S. state I live in  Kansas. I didn't follow along with the crowd. I wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles. I was outspoken and extremely social. Even these pictures and postcards  of my London semester abroad    years ago show that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different. But that same year  I was in London     years ago  I realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique  and that changed everything. I became the opposite of who I thought I once was. I stayed in my room instead of socializing. I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities. I didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore. I told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing  not that I was suddenly looking for acceptance. I had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance. After all  I was a bit unconventional. But I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding. Hiding is a progressive habit  and once you start hiding  it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out. In fact  even now  when I was talking to people about what this talk was about  I made up a cover story and I even hid the truth about my TED Talk. So it is fitting and scary that I have returned  to this city    years later and I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding. What have I been hiding for    years  I am a lesbian. Thank you. I've struggled to say those words  because I didn't want to be defined by them. Every time I would think about coming out in the past  I would think to myself  but I just want to be known as Morgana  uniquely Morgana  but not  my lesbian friend Morgana   or  my gay coworker Morgana.  Just Morgana. For those of you from large metropolitan areas  this may not seem like a big deal to you. It may seem strange  that I have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long. But I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted. And I'm not alone  of course. A      Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity. Of all the employees they surveyed     percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work. Of all the gay  lesbian and bisexual employees     percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves so they would not  appear at work  too gay.  The study found that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion programs  employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe  conformity is critical to their long term career advancement. And while I was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves  I was scared when I discovered that my silence has life or death consequences and long term social repercussions. Twelve years  the length by which  life expectancy is shortened for gay  lesbian and bisexual people in highly anti gay communities compared to accepting communities. Twelve years reduced life expectancy. When I read that in The Advocate  magazine this year  I realized I could no longer afford to keep silent. The effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination. The study found that gays in anti gay communities had higher rates of heart disease  violence and suicide. What I once thought was simply a personal matter I realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine. My choice to hide and not share who I really am may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination. I'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay  but the idea that my silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas. In February  the Kansas House of  Representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services. A former coworker and friend of mine has a father who serves in the Kansas House of Representatives. He voted in favor of the bill  in favor of a law that would allow  businesses to not serve me. How does my friend feel about lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender  queer and questioning people  How does her father feel  I don't know  because I was never honest  with them about who I am. And that shakes me to the core. What if I had told her my story years ago  Could she have told  her father my experience  Could I have ultimately helped change his vote  I will never know  and that made me realize I had done nothing to try to make a difference. How ironic that I work in human resources  a profession that works to welcome  connect and encourage the development of employees  a profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace  and yet I have done nothing to advocate for diversity. When I came to this company one year ago  I thought to myself  this company  has anti discrimination policies that protect gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender people. Their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs. When I walk through the doors of this company  I will finally come out. But I didn't. Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity  I did nothing. When I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook from my London semester abroad    years ago  I came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book   Paradise.   There are more scary things inside than outside.  And then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom   Remember this.  I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London  but the message I missed was the need  to start exploring and embracing myself. What I didn't realize until all these years later is that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome are my own fears and insecurities. I believe that by facing my fears inside  I will be able to change reality outside. I made a choice today to reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long. I hope that this means I will never hide again  and I hope that by coming out today  I can do something to change the data and also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled in both their professional and personal lives. Thank you. On June           precisely at      in a balmy winter afternoon in S o Paulo  Brazil  a typical South American winter afternoon  this kid  this young man  that you see celebrating here like he had scored a goal  Juliano Pinto     years old  accomplished a magnificent deed. Despite being paralyzed and not having any sensation from mid chest to the tip of his toes as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother and produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair  Juliano rose to the occasion  and on this day did something that pretty much everybody that saw him  in the six years deemed impossible. Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick of the      Brazilian  World Soccer Cup here just by thinking. He could not move his body  but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball. He was an athlete before the lesion. He's a para athlete right now. He's going to be in the Paralympic Games  I hope  in a couple years. But what the spinal cord lesion  did not rob from Juliano was his ability to dream. And dream he did that afternoon  for a stadium of about        people and an audience of close to a billion watching on TV. And that kick crowned  basically     years of basic research studying how the brain  how this amazing universe that we have between our ears that is only comparable to universe that we have above our head because it has about     billion elements talking to each other through electrical brainstorms  what Juliano accomplished took    years to imagine in laboratories and about    years to plan. When John Chapin and I     years ago  proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain machine interface  meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices  no matter how far they are from their own bodies  just by imagining what they want to do  our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help  of the psychiatry variety. And despite that  a Scot and a Brazilian persevered  because that's how we were raised in our respective countries  and for        years  we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible. And a brain machine interface is not rocket science  it's just brain research. It's nothing but using sensors to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord  so we projected sensors that can read hundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously  and extract from these electrical signals the motor planning that the brain is generating to actually make us move into space. And by doing that  we converted these signals into digital commands that any mechanical  electronic  or even a virtual device can understand so that the subject can imagine what he  she or it wants to make move  and the device obeys that brain command. By sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors  as you are going to see in a moment  we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary motor will was being enacted  no matter where    next to the subject  next door  or across the planet. And as this message gave feedback back to the brain  the brain realized its goal  to make us move. So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago  where a monkey  without moving its body  learned to control the movements of an avatar arm  a virtual arm that doesn't exist. What you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey as it explores three different visually identical spheres in virtual space. And to get a reward  a drop of orange juice that monkeys love  this animal has to detect  select one of these objects by touching  not by seeing it  by touching it  because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects  an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal describing the fine texture of the surface of this object  so the animal can judge what is  the correct object that he has to grab  and if he does that  he gets a reward without moving a muscle. The perfect Brazilian lunch  not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice. So as we saw this happening  we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published    years ago. We reenacted this paper. We got it out of the drawers  and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed to actually use the brain machine interface to regain mobility. The idea was that if you suffered    and that can happen to any one of us. Let me tell you  it's very sudden. It's a millisecond of a collision  a car accident that transforms your life completely. If you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord  you cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles. However  your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head. Paraplegic  quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night. They have that inside their head. The problem is how to get that code out of it and make the movement be created again. So what we proposed was  let's create a new body. Let's create a robotic vest. And that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking  because he was wearing the first brain controlled robotic vest that can be used by paraplegic  quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback. That was the original idea     years ago. What I'm going to show you is how     people from    countries all over the five continents of this beautiful Earth  dropped their lives  dropped their patents  dropped their dogs  wives  kids  school  jobs  and congregated to come to Brazil for    months to actually get this done. Because a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup  we heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the Germans  of course. But that's a different talk  and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that. But what Brazil wanted to do is to showcase a completely different country  a country that values science and technology  and can give a gift to millions     million people around the world that cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury. Well  we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed  well  let's have the kickoff of the      World Cup be given by a Brazilian paraplegic using a brain controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball and to feel the contact of the ball. They looked at us  thought that we were completely nuts  and said   Okay  let's try.  We had    months to do everything from zero  from scratch. We had no exoskeleton  we had no patients  we had nothing done. These people came all together and in    months  we got eight patients in a routine of training and basically built from nothing this guy  that we call Bra Santos Dumont  . The first brain controlled exoskeleton to be built was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever  Alberto Santos Dumont  who  on October           created and flew himself the first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see. Sorry  my American friends  I live in North Carolina  but it was two years before the Wright Brothers flew on the coast of North Carolina. Flight control is Brazilian.  Laughter  So we went together with these guys and we basically put this exoskeleton together     degrees of freedom  hydraulic machine that can be commanded by brain signals recorded by a non invasive technology called electroencephalography that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements and send his commands to the controls  the motors  and get it done. This exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin invented by Gordon Cheng  one of my greatest friends  in Munich  to allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground to be delivered back to the patient through a vest  a shirt. It is a smart shirt with micro vibrating elements that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient's brain by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him  but it is he who is walking again. So we got this going  and what you'll see here is the first time one of our patients  Bruno  actually walked. And he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything  and you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet because Bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs to be performed  the computer is going to analyze it  Bruno is going to certify it  and when it is certified  the device starts moving under the command of Bruno's brain. And he just got it right  and now he starts walking. After nine years without being able to move  he is walking by himself. And more than that    more than just walking  he is feeling the ground  and if the speed of the exo goes up  he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos  the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident. That's why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno's head. So he walks  and at the end of the walk    I am running out of time already    he says   You know  guys  I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married  because I wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself. Of course  he will have it whenever he wants. And this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup  and couldn't  because for some mysterious reason  FIFA cut its broadcast in half. What you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd  and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation. Basically  the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go. It can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback  and when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball  you are going to see two streams of green and yellow light coming from the helmet and going to the legs  representing the mental commands that were taken by the exo to actually make that happen. And in basically    seconds  Juliano actually did. You can see the commands. He gets ready   the ball is set  and he kicks. And the most amazing thing is     seconds after he did that  and looked at us on the pitch  he told us  celebrating as you saw   I felt the ball.  And that's priceless. So where is this going to go  I have two minutes to tell you that it's going to the limits of your imagination. Brain actuating technology is here. This is the latest  We just published this a year ago  the first brain to brain interface that allows two animals to exchange mental messages so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment can send a mental SMS  a torpedo  a neurophysiological torpedo  to the second animal  and the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message  because the message came from the first animal's brain. So this is the first demo. I'm going to be very quick because I want to show you the latest. But what you see here is the first rat getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward. He goes there and does it. And the same time  he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn't see any light  and the second rat  in    percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina. Well  we took this to a little higher limit by getting monkeys to collaborate  mentally in a brain net  basically to donate their brain activity and combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before  and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains  synchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move. One monkey is controlling the x dimension  the other monkey is controlling the y dimension. But it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there and you ask one monkey to control x and y  the other monkey to control y and z  and the third one to control x and z  and you make them all play the game together  moving the arm in  D into a target to get the famous Brazilian orange juice. And they actually do. The black dot is the average of all these brains working in parallel  in real time. That is the definition of a biological computer  interacting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal. Where is this going  We have no idea. We're just scientists. We are paid to be children  to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there. But one thing I know  One day  in a few decades  when our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking  or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see  or somebody speaks because of a brain to brain bypass  some of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon in a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick. Thank you. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Miguel  thank you for sticking to your time. I actually would have given you a couple more minutes  because there are a couple of points we want to develop  and  of course  clearly it seems that we need connected  brains to figure out where this is going. So let's connect all this together. So if I'm understanding correctly  one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse. Miguel Nicolelis   No  it's a little different. No monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys. They are getting a visual feedback in  D  but the task they have to accomplish is  D. They have to move an arm in three dimensions. But each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls. And to get that thing done  you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains  but the ideal is three. So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down  the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back  so this adjusts dynamically  but the global synchrony remains the same. Now  if you flip without telling the monkey the dimensions that each brain has to control  like this guy is controlling x and y  but he should be controlling now y and z  instantaneously  that animal's brain forgets about the old dimensions and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions. So what I need to say is that no Turing machine  no computer can predict what a brain net will do. So we will absorb technology as part of us. Technology will never absorb us. It's simply impossible. BG  How many times have you tested this  And how many times have you succeeded versus failed  MN  Oh  tens of times. With the three monkeys  Oh  several times. I wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times. And I forgot to mention  because of time  that just three weeks ago  a European group just demonstrated the first man to man brain to brain connection. BG  And how does that play  MN  There was one bit of information    big ideas start in a humble way    but basically the brain activity of one subject was transmitted to a second object  all non invasive technology. So the first subject got a message  like our rats  a visual message  and transmitted it to the second subject. The second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex  or a different pulse  two different pulses. In one pulse  the subject saw something. On the other pulse  he saw something different. And he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the Internet across continents. Moderator  Wow. Okay  that's where we are going. That's the next TED Talk at the next conference. Miguel Nicolelis  thank you. MN  Thank you  Bruno. Thank you. I want to speak about  a forgotten conflict. It's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines. It happens right here  in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now  most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo  so let me give you a couple of key facts. The Congolese conflict is the deadliest  conflict since World War II. It has caused almost four million deaths. It has destabilized most of Central Africa for the past    years. It is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world. That's why I first went to Congo in     . I was a young humanitarian aid worker  and I met this woman who was my age. She was called Isabelle. Local militias had attacked Isabelle's village. They had killed many men  raped many women. They had looted everything. And then they wanted to take Isabelle  but her husband stepped in  and he said   No  please don't take Isabelle. Take me instead.  So he had gone to the forest with the militias  and Isabelle had never seen him again. Well  it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband that I have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about. Although there is one story about Congo that you may have heard. It's a story about minerals and rape. Policy statements and media reports both usually focus on a primary cause of violence in Congo    the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources    and on a main consequence    sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war. So  not that these two issues aren't important and tragic. They are. But today I want to tell you  a different story. I want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause of the ongoing conflict. Violence in Congo is in large part driven by local bottom up conflicts that international peace efforts have failed to help address. The story starts from the fact that not only is Congo notable for being the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis  but it is also home to some of the largest international peacebuilding efforts in the world. Congo hosts the largest and most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world. It was also the site of the first European led peacekeeping mission  and for its first cases ever  the International Criminal Court chose to prosecute Congolese warlords. In       when Congo held the first  free national elections in its history  many observers thought that an end to  violence in the region had finally come. The international community lauded the  successful organization of these elections as finally an example of successful international intervention in a failed state. But the eastern provinces have continued to face massive population displacements and horrific human rights violations. Shortly before I went back there last summer  there was a horrible massacre in the province of South Kivu. Thirty three people were killed. They were mostly women and children  and many of them were hacked to death. During the past eight years  fighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited full scale civil and international war. So basically  every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace  the conflict explodes again. Why  Why have the massive international efforts failed to help Congo  achieve lasting peace and security  Well  my answer to this question revolves around two central observations. First  one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in Congo is fundamentally local    and when I say local  I really mean at the level of the individual  the family  the clan  the municipality  the community  the district  sometimes the ethnic group. For instance  you remember the story of Isabelle that I told you. Well  the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village was because they wanted to take the land that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive. The second central observation is that international peace efforts have failed to help address local conflicts because of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture. So what I mean is that Western and African diplomats  United Nations peacekeepers  donors  the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict  they all share a specific way of seeing the world. And I was one of these people  and I shared this culture  so I know all too well how powerful it is. Throughout the world  and throughout conflict zones  this common culture shapes the intervener's understanding of the causes of violence as something that is primarily located in the national and international spheres. It shapes our understanding of the path toward peace as something again that requires top down intervention to address national and international tensions. And it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors as engaging in national and international peace processes. Even more importantly  this common culture enables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro level tensions that often jeopardize the macro level settlements. So for instance  in Congo  because of how they are socialized and trained  United Nations officials  donors  diplomats  the staff of most nongovernmental organizations  they interpret continued fighting and massacres as a top down problem. To them  the violence they see is the consequence of tensions between President Kabila and various national opponents  and tensions between Congo  Rwanda and Uganda. In addition  these international  peacebuilders view local conflicts as simply the result of national and international tensions  insufficient state authority  and what they call the Congolese people's so called inherent penchant for violence. The dominant culture also constructs intervention at the national and international levels as the only natural and legitimate task for United Nations staffers and diplomats. And it elevates the organization of general elections  which is now a sort of cure all  as the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism over more effective state building approaches. And that happens not only in Congo but also in many other conflict zones. But let's dig deeper  into the other main sources of violence. In Congo  continuing violence is motivated not only by the national and international causes but also by longstanding bottom up agendas whose main instigators are villagers  traditional chiefs  community chiefs or ethnic leaders. Many conflicts revolve around political  social and economic stakes that are distinctively local. For instance  there is a lot of competition at the village or district level over who can be chief of village or chief of territory according to traditional law  and who can control the distribution of land and the exploitation of local mining sites. This competition often results in localized fighting  for instance in one village or territory  and quite frequently  it escalates into generalized fighting  so across a whole province  and even at times into neighboring countries. Take the conflict between Congolese  of Rwandan descent and the so called indigenous  communities of the Kivus. This conflict started in the     s during Belgian colonization  when both communities competed over access to land and to local power. Then  in       after Congolese independence  it escalated because each camp tried to align with national politicians  but still to advance their local agendas. And then  at the time of the      genocide in Rwanda  these local actors allied with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups  but still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the Kivus. And since then  these local disputes over land and local power have fueled violence  and they have regularly jeopardized the national and international settlements. So we can wonder why in these circumstances the international peacebuilders have failed to help implement local peacebuilding programs. And the answer is that international interveners deem the resolution of grassroots conflict an unimportant  unfamiliar  and illegitimate task. The very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally with existing cultural norms  and it threatens key organizational interests. For instance  the very identity of the United Nations as this macro level diplomatic organization would be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts. And the result is that neither the internal resistance to the dominant ways of working nor the external shocks have managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate their understanding of violence and intervention. And so far  there have been only very few exceptions. There have been exceptions  but only very few exceptions  to this broad pattern. So to wrap up  the story I just told you is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture shapes the intervener's understanding of what the causes of violence are  how peace is made  and what interventions should accomplish. These understandings enable international peacebuilders to ignore the micro level foundations that are so necessary for sustainable peace. The resulting inattention to local conflicts leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term and potential war resumption in the long term. And what's fascinating is that this analysis helps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict and international intervention failures  in Africa and elsewhere. Local conflicts fuel violence in most war and post war environments  from Afghanistan to Sudan to Timor Leste  and in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive  bottom up peacebuilding initiatives  these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable. One of the best examples is the contrast between the relatively peaceful situation in Somaliland  which benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives  and the violence prevalent in the rest of Somalia  where peacebuilding has been mostly top down. And there are several other cases in which local  grassroots conflict resolution has made a crucial difference. So if we want international peacebuilding to work  in addition to any top down intervention  conflicts must be resolved from the bottom up. And again  it's not that national and international tensions don't matter. They do. And it's not that national and international peacebuilding isn't necessary. It is. Instead  it is that both macro level and micro level peacebuilding are needed to make peace sustainable  and local nongovernmental organizations  local authorities and  civil society representatives should be the main actors in the bottom up process. So of course  there are obstacles. Local actors often lack the funding and sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity to implement effective  local peacebuilding programs. So international actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution. As for Congo  what can be done  After two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions  it's clear that we need to change our approach. Based on my field research  I believe that international and Congolese actors should pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict and the promotion of inter community reconciliation. So for instance  in the province of the Kivus  the Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese partners have set up inter community forums to discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land  and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence. That's the kind of program that is sorely needed throughout eastern Congo. It's with programs like this that we can help people like Isabelle and her husband. So these will not be magic wands  but because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence  they could definitely be game changers. Thank you. Hi. Today I'm going to share my personal journey with female genital mutilation  FGM. Feel free to cry  laugh  cross your legs  or do anything your body feels like doing. I'm not going to name the things your body does. I was born in Sierra Leone. Did anybody watch  Blood Diamond   If you have any thoughts    I don't have any diamonds  on me  by the way. If you have heard of Ebola  well  that's in Sierra Leone as well. I don't have Ebola. You're all safe. Don't rush to the door. Be seated. You're fine. I was checked before I got here. My grandfather had three wives. Don't ask me why a man needs more than one wife. Men  do you need more than one wife  I don't think so. There you go. He was looking for a heart attack  that's what I say. Oh yeah  he was. When I was three  war broke out in Sierra Leone in     . I remember literally going to bed one night  everything was good. The next day  I woke up  bombs were dropping everywhere  and people were trying to kill me and my family. We escaped the war and ended up in Gambia  in West Africa. Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it. While we were there as refugees  we didn't know what was going to become of us. My mom applied for refugee status. She's a wonderful  smart woman  that one  and we were lucky. Australia said  we will take you in. Good job  Aussies. Before we were meant to travel  my mom came home one day  and said   We're going on  a little holiday  a little trip.  She put us in a car  and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in Gambia. In this bush  we found two huts. An old lady came towards us. She was ethnic looking  very old. She had a chat with my mom  and went back. Then she came back and walked away from us into a second hut. I'm standing there thinking   This is very confusing. I don't know what's going on.  The next thing I knew  my mom took me into this hut. She took my clothes off  and then she pinned me down on the floor. I struggled and tried to get her off me  but I couldn't. Then the old lady came towards me with a rusty looking knife  one of the sharp knives  orange looking  has never seen water or sunlight before. I thought she was going to slaughter me  but she didn't. She slowly slid down my body and ended up where my vagina is. She took hold of what I now know to be my clitoris  she took that rusty knife  and started cutting away  inch by inch. I screamed  I cried  and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop  but all she did was say   Be quiet.  This old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever  and then when she was done  she threw that piece of flesh across the floor as if it was the most disgusting thing she's ever touched. They both got off me  and left me there bleeding  crying  and confused as to what just happened. We never talked about this again. Very soon  we found that we were coming to Australia  and this is when you had the Sydney Olympics at the time  and people said we were going to the end of the world  there was nowhere else to go after Australia. Yeah  that comforted us a bit. It took us three days to get here. We went to Senegal  then France  and then Singapore. We went to the bathroom to wash our hands. We spent    minutes opening the tap like this. Then somebody came in  slid their hand under and water came out  and we thought  is this what we're in for  Like  seriously. We got to Adelaide  small place  where literally they dumped us in Adelaide  that's what I would say. They dumped us there. We were very grateful. We settled and we liked it. We were like   We're home  we're here.  Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall. Adelaide has only one mall. It's this small place. And we saw a lot of Asian people. My mom said all of a sudden  panicking   You brought us to the wrong place. You must take us back to Australia.  Yeah. It had to be explained to her that  there were a lot of Asians in Australia and we were in the right place. So fine  it's all good. My mom then had this brilliant idea that I should go to a girls school because they were less racist. I don't know where she read  that publication.  Laughter  Never found evidence of it to this day. Six hundred white kids   and I was the only black child there. No  I was the only person with a bit of a color on me. Let me say that. Chocolate color. There were no Asians  no indigenous. All we had was some tan girls  girls who felt the need to be under the sun. It wasn't the same as my chocolate  though. Not the same. Settling in Australia was quite hard  but it became harder when I started volunteering for an organization called Women's Health Statewide  and I joined their female genital mutilation program without any awareness of what this program was actually about  or that it related to me in any way. I spent months educating nurses and doctors about what female genital mutilation was and where it was practiced  Africa  the Middle East  Asia  and now  Australia and London and America  because  as we all know  we live in a multicultural society  and people who come from those backgrounds come with their culture  and sometimes they have cultural practices that we may not agree with  but they continue to practice them. One day  I was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation  FGM  I will just say FGM for short. Type I is when they cut off the hood. Type II is when they cut off the whole clitoris and some of your labia majora  or your outer lips  and Type III is when they  cut off the whole clitoris and then they sew you up so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period. My eyes went onto Type II. Before all of this  I pretty much had amnesia. I was in so much shock  and traumatized by what had happened  I didn't remember any of it. Yes  I was aware something bad happened to me  but I had no recollection of what had happened. I knew I had a scar down there  but I thought everybody had a scar down there. This had happened to everybody else. But when I looked at Type II  it all came back to me. I remembered what was done to me. I remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down. Words cannot express the pain I felt  the confusion that I felt  because now I realized that  what was done to me was a terrible thing that in this society was called barbaric  it was called mutilation. My mother had said it was called circumcision  but here it was mutilation. I was thinking  I'm mutilated  I'm a mutilated person. Oh my God. And then the anger came. I was a black angry woman.  Laughter  Oh yeah. A little one  but angry nevertheless. I went home and said to my mom   You did something.  This is not the African thing to do  pointing at your mother  but hey  I was ready for any consequences.  You did something to me.  She's like   What are you talking about  Khadija   She's used to me mouthing off. I'm like   Those years ago  You circumcised me. You cut away something that belonged to me.  She said   Yes  I did. I did it for your own good. It was in your best interest. Your grandmother did it to me  and I did it to you. It's made you a woman.  I'm like   How   She said   You're empowered  Khadija. Do you get itchy down there   I'm like   No  why would I get itchy down there   She said   Well  if you were not circumcised  you would get itchy down there. Women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time. Then they sleep around with everybody. You are not going to sleep around with anybody.  And I thought  her definition of empowerment was very strange.  Laughter  That was the end of our first conversation. I went back to school. These were the days when we had  Dolly and Girlfriend magazines. There was always the sealed section. Anybody remember those sealed sections  The naughty bits  you know  Oh yeah  I love those.  Laughter  Anyway  there was always an article about pleasure and relationships and  of course  sex. But it always assumed that you had a clitoris  though  and I thought  this doesn't fit me. This doesn't talk about people like me. I don't have a clitoris. I watched TV and those women would moan like   Oh  Oh   I was like  these people and their damned clitoris. What is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life  That's what I want to know. I want to do that too     Oh  Oh   and all of that. Didn't happen. So I came home once again and said to my mom   Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure  that I should be having orgasms  and that white men should figure out how to find the clitoris.  Apparently  white men have a problem finding the clitoris. Just saying  it wasn't me. It was Dolly that said that. And I thought to myself  I had an inner joke in my head that said   I will marry a white man. He won't have that problem with me.   Laughter  So I said to my mom   Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure  and do you know what you have taken away from me  what you have denied me  You have invaded me in the most sacred way. I want pleasure. I want to get horny  dammit  as well.  And she said to me   Who is Dolly and Girlfriend  Are they your new friends  Khadija   I was like   No  they're not. That's a magazine  mom  a magazine.  She didn't get it. We came from two different worlds. When she was growing up  not having a clitoris was the norm. It was celebrated. I was an African Australian girl. I lived in a society that was very clitoris centric. It was all about the damn clitoris  And I didn't have one  That pissed me off. So once I went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion  I remember booking an appointment with my therapist. Yes  I'm an African  who has a therapist. There you go. And I said to her   I was   . I was a child. I was settling in a new country  I was dealing with racism and discrimination  English is my third language  and then there it was.  I said to her   I feel like I'm not a woman because of what was done to me. I feel incomplete. Am I going to be asexual   Because from what I knew about FGM  the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women. It's so that we don't have any sexual desire. And I said   Am I asexual now  Will I just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex  not enjoying sex   She couldn't answer my questions  so they went unanswered. When I started having my period around the age of     I realized I didn't have  normal periods because of FGM. My periods were heavy  they were long  and they were very painful. Then they told me I had fibroids. They're like these little balls sitting there. One was covering one of my ovaries. And there came then the big news.  We don't think you can have children  Khadija.  And once again  I was an angry black woman. I went home and I said to my mom   Your act  your action  no matter what your may defense may be     because she thought she did it out love     what you did out of love  is harming me  and it's hurting me. What do you have to say for that   She said   I did what I had to do as a mother.  I'm still waiting for an apology  by the way. Then I got married. And once again    FGM is like the gift that keeps giving. You figure that out very soon. Sex was very painful. It hurt all the time. And of course I realized  they said   You can't have kids.  I thought   Wow  is this my existence  Is this what life is all about   I'm proud to tell you  five months ago  I was told I was pregnant. I am the lucky girl. There are so many women out there who have gone through FGM who have infertility. I know a nine year old girl who has incontinence  constant infections  pain. It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving. It affects every area of your life  and this happened to me because I was born a girl in the wrong place. That's why it happened to me. I channel all that anger   all that pain  into advocacy because I needed my pain to be worth something. So I'm the director of an organization called No FGM Australia. You heard me right. Why No FGM Australia  FGM is in Australia. Two days ago  I had to call Child Protective Services  because somewhere in Australia  there's a four year old there's a four year old whose mom  is planning on performing FGM on her. That child is in kindy. I'll let that sink in  four years old. A couple of months ago  I met a lady who is married to a Malaysian man. Her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters back to Malaysia to cut off their clitoris. And she said   Why   He said they were dirty. And she said   Well  you married me.  He said   Oh  this is my cultural belief.  They then went into a whole discussion where she said to him   Over my dead body will you do that to my daughters.  But imagine if this woman wasn't aware of what FGM was  if they never had that conversation  Her children would have been flown over to Malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives. Do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that   Three children per day  in Australia are at risk of having FGM performed on them. This is an Australian problem  people. It's not an African problem. It's not a Middle Eastern problem. It's not white  it's not black  it has no color  it's everybody's problem. FGM is child abuse. It's violence against women. It's saying that women don't have a right to sexual pleasure. It says we don't have a right to our bodies. Well  I say no to that  and you know what  Bullshit. That's what I have to say to that. I am proud to say that I'm doing my part in ending FGM. What are you going to do  There may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of FGM. There may be a patient who comes to your hospital who is at risk of FGM. But this is the reality  that even in our beloved Australia  the most wonderful place in the world  children are being abused because of a culture. Culture should not be a defense for child abuse. I want ever single one of you to see FGM as an issue for you. Make it personal. It could be your daughter  your sister  your cousin. I can't fight FGM alone. I could try  but I can't. So my appeal to you is  please join me. Sign my petition on Change.org and type in Khadija  my name  and it'll come up  and sign it. The aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them  because every child has a right to pleasure. Every child has a right to their bodies being left intact  and dammit  ever child has a right to a clitoris. So please join me in ending this act. My favorite quote is   All it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and women to do nothing.  Are you going to let this evil of female genital mutilation to prevail in Australia  I don't think so  so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation. Thank you. I'm a blogger  a filmmaker and a butcher  and I'll explain how these identities come together. It started four years ago  when a friend and I opened our first Ramadan fast at one of the busiest mosques in New York City. Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets. It was an FBI agent's wet dream.  Laughter  But being a part of this community  we knew how welcoming this space was. For years  I'd seen photos  of this space being documented as a lifeless and cold monolith  much like the stereotypical image painted of the American Muslim experience. Frustrated by this myopic view  my friend and I had this crazy idea  Let's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of Ramadan and share those stories on a blog. We called it     Mosques in    Days   and we drove to all the    states and shared stories from over     vastly different Muslim communities  ranging from the Cambodian refugees in the L.A. projects to the black Sufis living in the woods of South Carolina. What emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America. The media coverage forced local journalists to revisit their Muslim communities  but what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world being inspired to take their own    mosque journey. There were even these two NFL athletes who took a sabbatical from the league to do so. And as    Mosques was blossoming around the world  I was actually stuck in Pakistan working on a film. My codirector  Omar  and I were at  a breaking point with many of our friends on how to position the film. The movie is called  These Birds Walk   and it is about wayward street kids who are struggling to find some semblance of family. We focus on the complexities of youth and family discord  but our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings to make the film  more relevant   essentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories into sociopolitical symbols. Of course  we didn't listen to them  and instead  we championed the tender gestures of love and headlong flashes of youth. The agenda behind our cinematic  immersion was only empathy  an emotion that's largely  deficient from films that come from our region of the world. And as  These Birds Walk  played at film  festivals and theaters internationally  I finally had my feet planted at home in New York  and with all the extra time and still no real money  my wife tasked me to cook more for us. And whenever I'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat  something felt off. For those that don't know  halal is a term used for meat that is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict Islamic guidelines. Unfortunately  the majority of halal meat in America doesn't rise to the standard that my faith calls for. The more I learned about these unethical practices  the more violated I felt  particularly because businesses from my own community were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy. So  with emotions running high  and absolutely no experience in butchery  some friends and I opened a meat store in the heart of the East Village fashion district. We call it Honest Chops  and we're reclaiming halal by sourcing organic  humanely raised animals  and by making it accessible and affordable to working class families. There's really nothing like it in America. The unbelievable part is actually that    percent of our in store customers are not even Muslim. For many  it is their first time  interacting with Islam on such an intimate level. So all these disparate projects     Laughter     are the result of a restlessness. They are a visceral response to the businesses and curators who work hard to oversimplify my beliefs and my community  and the only way to beat their machine is to play by different rules. We must fight with an inventive approach. With the trust  with the access  with the love that only we can bring  we must unapologetically reclaim our beliefs in every moving image  in every cut of meat  because if we whitewash our stories for the sake of mass appeal  not only will we fail  but we will be trumped by those with more money and more resources to tell our stories. But the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance. It is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful. They demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected. Thank you. So recently  we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest  and that's true  but after more than a decade of studying and participating in multiple social movements  I've come to realize that the way technology empowers social movements can also paradoxically help weaken them. This is not inevitable  but overcoming it requires diving deep into what makes success possible over the long term. And the lessons apply in multiple domains. Now  take Turkey's Gezi Park protests  July       which I went back to study in the field. Twitter was key to its organizing. It was everywhere in the park    well  along with a lot of tear gas. It wasn't all high tech. But the people in Turkey had already gotten used to the power of Twitter because of an unfortunate incident about a year before when military jets had bombed and killed    Kurdish smugglers near the border region  and Turkish media completely censored this news. Editors sat in their newsrooms and waited for the government to tell them what to do. One frustrated journalist could not take this anymore. He purchased his own plane ticket  and went to the village where this had occurred. And he was confronted by this scene  a line of coffins coming down a hill  relatives wailing. He later he told me how overwhelmed he felt  and didn't know what to do  so he took out his phone  like any one of us might  and snapped that picture and tweeted it out. And voila  that picture went viral and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it. So when  a year later  Turkey's Gezi protests happened  it started as a protest about a park being razed  but became an anti authoritarian protest. It wasn't surprising that media also censored it  but it got a little ridiculous at times. When things were so intense  when CNN International was broadcasting live from Istanbul  CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins. Now  I love penguin documentaries  but that wasn't the news of the day. An angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture  and that one too went viral  and since then  people call Turkish media the penguin media.  Laughter  But this time  people knew what to do. They just took out their phones and looked for actual news. Better  they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate and share it more on social media. Digital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations. Everything was organized partially with the help of these new technologies. And using Internet to mobilize and publicize protests actually goes back a long way. Remember the Zapatistas  the peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico led by the masked  pipe smoking  charismatic Subcomandante Marcos  That was probably the first movement that got global attention thanks to the Internet. Or consider Seattle '    when a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention to what was then an obscure organization  the World Trade Organization  by also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize. And more recently  movement after movement has shaken country after country  the Arab uprisings from Bahrain to Tunisia to Egypt and more  indignados in Spain  Italy  Greece  the Gezi Park protests  Taiwan  Euromaidan in Ukraine  Hong Kong. And think of more recent initiatives  like the  BringBackOurGirls hashtags. Nowadays  a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign. A Facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization. Amazing. But think of the moments I just mentioned. The achievements they were able to have  their outcomes  are not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired. The hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched by what they were able to have as a result in the end. And this raises a question  As digital technology makes things easier for movements  why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well  In embracing digital platforms for activism and politics  are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way  Now  I believe so. I believe that the rule of thumb is  Easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains. Now  to be clear  technology does empower in multiple ways. It's very powerful. In Turkey  I watched four young college students organize a countrywide citizen journalism network called    Journos that became the central hub for uncensored news in the country. In Egypt  I saw another four young people use digital connectivity to organize the supplies and logistics for    field hospitals  very large operations  during massive clashes near Tahrir Square in     . And I asked the founder of this effort  called Tahrir Supplies  how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started.  Five minutes   he said. Five minutes. And he had no training or background in logistics. Or think of the Occupy movement which rocked the world in     . It started with a single email from a magazine  Adbusters  to        subscribers in its list. About two months after that first email  there were in the United States     ongoing occupations and protests. Less than one month after the first physical occupation in Zuccotti Park  a global protest was held in about    countries      cities. It was one of the largest global protests ever organized. Now  compare that to what the Civil Rights Movement had to do in      Alabama to protest the racially segregated bus system  which they wanted to boycott. They'd been preparing for many years and decided it was time to swing into action after Rosa Parks was arrested. But how do you get the word out    tomorrow we're going to start the boycott    when you don't have Facebook  texting  Twitter  none of that  So they had to mimeograph        leaflets by sneaking into a university duplicating room and working all night  secretly. They then used the    African American organizations that criss crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand. And the logistical tasks were daunting  because these were poor people. They had to get to work  boycott or no  so a massive carpool was organized  again by meeting. No texting  no Twitter  no Facebook. They had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going. Today  it would be so much easier. We could create a database  available rides and what rides you need  have the database coordinate  and use texting. We wouldn't have to meet all that much. But again  consider this  the Civil Rights Movement in the United States navigated a minefield of political dangers  faced repression and overcame  won major policy concessions  navigated and innovated through risks. In contrast  three years after Occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality  the policies that fueled it are still in place. Europe was also rocked by anti austerity protests  but the continent didn't shift its direction. In embracing these technologies  are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained  To understand this  I went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests and I interviewed a range of people  from activists to politicians  from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements. I found that the Gezi protesters were despairing. They were frustrated  and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for. This echoed what I'd been hearing around the world from many other protesters that I'm in touch with. And I've come to realize that part of the problem is that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mt. Everest with the help of    Sherpas  and the Internet is our Sherpa. What we're doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work. Because  you see  the kind of work that went into organizing all those daunting  tedious logistical tasks did not just take care of those tasks  they also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively and make hard decisions together  create consensus and innovate  and maybe even more crucially  keep going together through differences. So when you see this March on Washington in       when you look at that picture  where this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous  I have a dream  speech        you don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech  you also see the painstaking  long term work that can put on that march. And if you're in power  you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march  not just the march  but the capacity signaled by that march  seriously. In contrast  when you look at Occupy's global marches that were organized in two weeks  you see a lot of discontent  but you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term. And crucially  the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically from boycotts to lunch counter sit ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides. Today's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges. They feel a little like startups that got very big without knowing what to do next  and they rarely manage to shift tactically because they don't have the depth of capacity to weather such transitions. Now  I want to be clear  The magic is not in the mimeograph. It's in that capacity to work together  think together collectively  which can only be built over time with a lot of work. To understand all this  I interviewed a top official from the ruling party in Turkey  and I ask him   How do you do it   They too use digital technology extensively  so that's not it. So what's the secret  Well  he told me. He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea. I said  what has that got to do with anything  Well  he said  his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one  and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes  in their wedding parties  circumcision ceremonies  and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes. With that many meetings every day  with tea offered at every one of them  which he could not refuse  because that would be rude  he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea  because that would be many kilos of sugar  he can't even calculate how many kilos  and at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast. We had met in the afternoon  and he was already way over caffeinated. But his party won two major elections within a year of the Gezi protests with comfortable margins. To be sure  governments have different resources to bring to the table. It's not the same game  but the differences are instructive. And like all such stories  this is not a story just of technology. It's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do. Today's social movements want to operate informally. They do not want institutional leadership. They want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation. They have a point. Modern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries by powerful interests. But operating this way makes it hard for them to sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system  which leads to frustrated protesters dropping out  and even more corrupt politics. And politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles  because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial. Climate change is barreling towards us. Inequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies. Authoritarianism is choking many countries. We need movements to be more effective. Now  some people have argued that the problem is today's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before  and that is not true. From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere  I've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line. It's also not true  as Malcolm Gladwell claimed  that today's protesters form weaker virtual ties. No  they come to these protests  just like before  with their friends  existing networks  and sometimes they do make new friends for life. I still see the friends that I made in those Zapatista convened global protests more than a decade ago  and the bonds between strangers are not worthless. When I got tear gassed in Gezi  people I didn't know helped me and one another instead of running away. In Tahrir  I saw people  protesters  working really hard to keep each other safe and protected. And digital awareness raising is great  because changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics. But movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast and figure out how to think together collectively  develop strong policy proposals  create consensus  figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage  because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself are not going to be enough. And there are many efforts. In New Zealand  a group of young people are developing a platform called Loomio for participatory decision making at scale. In Turkey     Journos are holding hack a thons so that they support communities as well as citizen journalism. In Argentina  an open source platform called DemocracyOS is bringing participation to parliaments and political parties. These are all great  and we need more  but the answer won't just be better online decision making  because to update democracy  we are going to need to innovate at every level  from the organizational to the political to the social. Because to succeed over the long term  sometimes you do need tea without sugar along with your Twitter. Thank you. When I was invited to give this talk  a couple of months ago  we discussed a number  of titles with the organizers  and a lot of different items were  kicked around and were discussed. But nobody suggested this one  and the reason for that was two months ago  Ebola was escalating exponentially and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen  and the world was terrified   concerned and alarmed by this disease  in a way we've not  seen in recent history. But today  I can stand here  and I can talk to you about beating Ebola because of people  whom you've never heard of  people like Peter Clement  a Liberian  doctor who's working in Lofa County  a place that many of you have  never heard of  probably  in Liberia. The reason that Lofa County  is so important is because about five months ago  when the epidemic was  just starting to escalate  Lofa County was right at the center   the epicenter of this epidemic. At that time  MSF and the treatment center there  they were seeing dozens of patients  every single day  and these patients  these communities were becoming more and more terrified as time went by  with this disease  and what it was doing to their families  to their communities   to their children  to their relatives. And so Peter Clement was charged with  driving that    hour long rough road from Monrovia  the capital  up to Lofa County  to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there. And what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you. So he sat down with the local chiefs   and he listened. And what he heard was heartbreaking. He heard about the devastation  and the desperation of people affected by this disease. He heard the heartbreaking stories about not just the damage that Ebola did to people  but what it did to families  and what it did to communities. And he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him    They said   When our children are sick   when our children are dying  we can't hold them at a time when  we want to be closest to them. When our relatives die  we can't take care of them as our tradition demands. We are not allowed to wash  the bodies to bury them the way our communities and  our rituals demand. And for this reason  they were deeply disturbed  deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic  was unraveling in front of them. People were turning on the healthcare  workers who had come  the heroes who had come to try  and help save the community  to help work with the community  and they were unable to access them. And what happened then was  Peter explained to the leaders. The leaders listened.  They turned the tables. And Peter explained what Ebola was. He explained what the disease was. He explained what it did to their communities. And he explained that Ebola threatened  everything that made us human. Ebola means you can't hold your children the way you would in this situation. You can't bury your dead  the way that you would. You have to trust these people  in these space suits to do that for you. And ladies and gentlemen  what  happened then was rather extraordinary  The community and the health workers   Peter  they sat down together and they put together a new plan  for controlling Ebola in Lofa County. And the reason that this is such  an important story  ladies and gentlemen  is because today  this county  which is  right at the center of this epidemic you've been watching   you've been seeing in the newspapers  you've been seeing on  the television screens  today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of Ebola. Now  this doesn't mean that  the job is done  obviously. There's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there. But what it does teach us  is that Ebola can be beaten. That's the key thing. Even on this scale  even with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here  we now know Ebola can be beaten. When communities come together  with health care workers  work together  that's when this disease can be stopped. But how did Ebola end up in Lofa County in the first place  Well  for that  we have to go back     months  to the start of this epidemic. And as many of you know   this virus went undetected  it evaded detection for three  or four months when it began. That's because this is not  a disease of West Africa  it's a disease of Central Africa   half a continent away. People hadn't seen the disease before  health workers hadn't seen  the disease before. They didn't know what  they were dealing with  and to make it  even more complicated  the virus itself was causing a symptom  a type of a presentation that wasn't classical of the disease. So people didn't even recognize  the disease  people who knew Ebola. For that reason it evaded detection  for some time  But contrary to public belief  sometimes these days  once the virus was detected   there was a rapid surge in of support. MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment  center  as many of you know  in the area. The World Health Organization and the partners that it works with deployed eventually hundreds of people  over the next two months to be able to help track the virus. The problem  ladies and gentlemen  is by then  this virus  well known now as Ebola   had spread too far. It had already outstripped what was  one of the largest responses that had been mounted so far to an Ebola outbreak. By the middle of the year  not just Guinea but now Sierra Leone and Liberia were also infected. As the virus was spreading geographically  the numbers were increasing and at this time  not only were  hundreds of people infected and dying of the disease  but as importantly  the front line responders  the people who had gone to try and help  the health care workers  the other  responders were also sick and dying by the dozens. The presidents of these countries  recognized the emergencies. They met right around that time   they agreed on common action and they put together an emergency  joint operation center in Conakry to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped  to implement the strategies we talked about. But what happened then was something  we had never seen before with Ebola. What happened then was the virus   or someone sick with the virus  boarded an airplane   flew to another country  and for the first time  we saw in another distant country the virus pop up again. This time it was in Nigeria  in the teeming metropolis of Lagos     million people. Now the virus was in that environment. And as you can anticipate   there was international alarm  international concern on a scale that  we hadn't seen in recent years caused by a disease like this. The World Health Organization immediately  called together an expert panel  looked at the situation   declared an international emergency. And in doing so  the expectation would be that there would be a huge outpouring of international assistance to help these countries which were in so much trouble and concern at that time. But what we saw was  something very different. There was some great response. A number of countries came to assist    many  many NGOs and others  as you know  but at the same time  the opposite  happened in many places. Alarm escalated  and very soon  these countries found themselves not receiving the support they needed  but increasingly isolated. What we saw was commercial airlines  stopped  flying into these countries and people who hadn't even been exposed to the virus were no longer allowed to travel. This caused not only problems  obviously   for the countries themselves  but also for the response. Those organizations that were  trying to bring people in  to try and help them respond to the outbreak  they could not get  people on airplanes  they could not get them into the  countries to be able to respond. In that situation  ladies and gentleman  a virus like Ebola takes advantage. And what we saw then was something  also we hadn't seen before. Not only did this virus  continue in the places where they'd already become infected  but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here  something we'd never seen before on such a scale  an exponential increase of Ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas  already infected in these countries but also spreading further and  deeper into these countries. Ladies and gentleman  this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we've ever seen. And what happened in these countries then  many of you saw  again  on the television  read about in the newspapers  we saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic. We saw the schools begin to close   markets no longer started  no longer functioned the way  that they should in these countries. We saw that misinformation and  misperceptions started to spread even faster through the communities  which became even more alarmed about the situation. They started to recoil from those people  that you saw in those space suits  as they call them   who had come to help them. And then the situation deteriorated even further. The countries had to declare a state of emergency. Large populations needed to be quarantined in some areas  and then riots broke out. It was a very  very terrifying situation. Around the world  many people began to ask  can we ever stop Ebola  when it starts to spread like this  And they started to ask  how well  do we really know this virus  The reality is we don't know  Ebola extremely well. It's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it. We've known the disease only for    years  since it first popped up in Central Africa in     . But despite that  we do know many things  We know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat. We know that it probably enters  a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus  and probably sickened by it. Then we know that the virus spreads from person to person through contaminated body fluids. And as you've all seen  we know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans  where we see this disease cause severe fevers  diarrhea  vomiting  and then unfortunately  in    percent of the cases or often more  death. This is a very dangerous  debilitating  and deadly disease. But despite the fact that we've not known this disease for a particularly long time  and we don't know everything about it  we do know how to stop this disease. There are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola. First and foremost  the communities  have got to understand this disease  they've got to understand  how it spreads and how to stop it. And then we've got to be able to have  systems that can find every single case  every contact of those cases  and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission. We have to have treatment centers  specialized Ebola treatment centers  where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected  so that they might survive the disease. And then for those who do die  we have to ensure there is a safe  but at the same time dignified  burial process  so that there is no spread  at that time as well. So we do know how to stop Ebola  and these strategies work  ladies and gentlemen. The virus was stopped in Nigeria  by these four strategies and the people implementing  them  obviously. It was stopped in Senegal  where it had spread  and also in the other countries that were affected by this virus   in this outbreak. So there's no question that  these strategies actually work. The big question  ladies and gentlemen  was whether these strategies could work on this scale  in this situation  with so many countries affected with the kind of exponential  growth that you saw. That was the big question that we were  facing just two or three months ago. Today we know the answer to that question. And we know that answer  because of the extraordinary work of an incredible group of NGOs  of governments  of local leaders  of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian  and other organizations that came and joined the fight to try and stop Ebola in West Africa. But what had to be done there  was slightly different. These countries took those strategies  I just showed you  the community engagement  the case finding  contact tracing  etc.  and they turned them on their head. There was so much disease  they approached it differently. What they decided to do was they would  first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected. They would rapidly build out many  many burial teams so that they could safely deal with the dead  and with that  they would try  and slow this outbreak to see if it could actually then  be controlled using the classic approach of case finding and contact tracing. And when I went to West Africa about three months ago  when I was there what I saw was extraordinary. I saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against Ebola so that they could personally coordinate  and oversee and champion this surge of international support  to try and stop this disease. We saw militaries from within  those countries and from far beyond coming in to help build  Ebola treatment centers that could be used to isolate  those who were sick. We saw the Red Cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there to help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead in a dignified manner themselves. And we saw the U.N. agencies   the World Food Program  build a tremendous air bridge that could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about. What we saw  ladies and gentlemen   which was probably most impressive  was this incredible work by the governments  by the leaders in these countries  with the communities  to try to ensure people  understood this disease  understood the extraordinary things they  would have to do to try and stop Ebola. And as a result  ladies and gentlemen  we saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier  whether or not it would be possible. What we saw was  what you see now in this graph  when we took stock on December  . What we saw was we could  bend that curve  so to speak  change this exponential growth  and bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak. And for this reason  ladies and gentlemen  there's absolutely no question now that we can catch up with this outbreak  in West Africa and we can beat Ebola. The big question  though   that many people are asking  even when they saw this curve  they said   Well  hang on a minute    that's great you can slow it down  but can you actually drive it down to zero   We already answered that question  back at the beginning of this talk  when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia. We told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation where they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks. But there are similar stories from  the other countries as well. From Gueckedou in Guinea  the first area where the first case was actually diagnosed. We've seen very  very few cases in the last couple of months  and here in Kenema  in Sierra Leone   another area in the epicenter  we have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks    way too early to declare  victory  obviously  but evidence  ladies and gentlemen  not only can the response  catch up to the disease  but this disease can be driven to zero. The challenge now  of course   is doing this on the scale needed right across these three countries  and that is a huge challenge. Because when you've been at something for this long  on this scale  two other big threats  come in to join the virus. The first of those is complacency  the risk that as this  disease curve starts to bend  the media look elsewhere   the world looks elsewhere. Complacency always a risk. And the other risk  of course  is when you've been working so hard for so long  and slept so few hours  over the past months  people are tired  people become fatigued  and these new risks  start to creep into the response. Ladies and gentlemen  I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa. The people of these countries  the leaders of these countries  they are not complacent. They want to drive Ebola to zero  in their countries. And these people  yes  they're tired   but they are not fatigued. They have an energy  they have a courage  they have the strength  to get this finished. What they need  ladies and gentlemen  at this point  is the unwavering support of the  international community  to stand with them  to bolster and bring even more support  at this time  to get the job finished. Because finishing Ebola right now  means turning the tables on this virus  and beginning to hunt it. Remember  this virus  this whole crisis   rather  started with one case  and is going to finish with one case. But it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists  enough health workers  enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one  of those cases  track their contacts and make sure that this disease  stops once and for all. Ladies and gentleman  Ebola can be beaten. Now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate them  on what it means to beat Ebola  and more importantly  we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries  to beat this disease. There are a lot of people out there  who will survive and will thrive  in part because of what you do  to help us beat Ebola. Thank you. You've heard of your I.Q.  your general intelligence  but what's your Psy Q  How much do you know about what makes you tick  and how good are you at predicting other people's behavior or even your own  And how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong  Let's find out by counting down the top    myths of psychology. You've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology  it's almost as if men are from Mars and women are from Venus. But how different are men and women really  To find out  let's start by looking at something on which men and women really do differ and plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale. One thing men and women do really differ on is how far they can throw a ball. So if we look at the data for men here  we see what is called a normal distribution curve. A few men can throw a ball really far  and a few men not far at all  but most a kind of average distance. And women share the same distribution as well  but actually there's quite a big difference. In fact  the average man can throw a ball further than about    percent of all women. So now let's look at what some psychological gender differences look like on the same standardized scale. Any psychologist will tell you that men are better at spatial awareness than women    so things like map reading   for example    and it's true  but let's have a look at the size of this difference. It's tiny  the lines are so close together they almost overlap. In fact  the average woman is better than    percent of all men  and of course  if that was    percent  then the two genders would be exactly equal. It's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one I'll show you are pretty much the biggest psychological gender differences ever discovered in psychology. So here's the next one. Any psychologist will tell you that women are better with language and grammar than men. So here's performance on the standardized grammar test. There go the women. There go the men. Again  yes  women are better on average  but the lines are so close that    percent of men are better than the average woman  and again  if it was    percent  that would represent complete gender equality. So it's not really a case of Mars and Venus. It's more a case of  if anything  Mars and Snickers  basically the same  but one's maybe  slightly nuttier than the other. I won't say which. Now we've got you warmed up. Let's psychoanalyze you using the famous Rorschach inkblot test. So you can probably see two  I dunno  two bears or two people or something. But what do you think they're doing  Put your hand up if you think they're saying hello. Not many people. Okay. Put your hands up if you think they are high fiving. Okay. What if you think they're fighting  Only a few people there. Okay  so if you think they're saying hello or high fiving  then that means you're a friendly person. If you think they're fighting  you're a bit more of a  nasty  aggressive person. Are you a lover or a fighter  basically. What about this one  This isn't really a voting one  so on  three everyone shout out what you see. One  two  three.  Audience shouting  I heard hamster. Who said hamster  That was very worrying. A guy there said hamster. Well  you should see some kind of two legged animal here  and then the mirror image of them there. If you didn't  then this means that you have difficulty processing complex situations where there's a lot going on. Except  of course  it doesn't mean that at all. Rorschach inkblot tests have basically no validity when it comes to diagnosing people's personality and are not used by modern day psychologists. In fact  one recent study found that when you do try to diagnose people's personalities using Rorschach inkblot tests  schizophrenia was diagnosed in about one sixth of apparently perfectly normal participants. So if you didn't do that well on this  maybe you are not a very visual type of person. So let's do another quick quiz to find out. When making a cake  do you prefer to    so hands up for each one again    do you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures  Yeah  a few people. Have a friend talk you through  Or have a go  making it up as you go along  Quite a few people there. Okay  so if you said A  then this means that you are a visual learner and you learn best when information is presented in a visual style. If you said B  it means you're an auditory learner  that you learn best when information is presented to you in an auditory format. And if you said C  it means that you're a kinesthetic learner  that you learn best when you get stuck in and do things with your hands. Except  of course  as you've probably guessed  that it doesn't  because the whole thing is a complete myth. Learning styles are made up and are  not supported by scientific evidence. So we know this because in tightly controlled experimental studies  when learners are given material to learn either in their preferred style or an opposite style  it makes no difference at all to the amount of information that they retain. And if you think about it for just a second  it's just obvious that this has to be true. It's obvious that the best presentation format depends not on you  but on what you're trying to learn. Could you learn to drive a car  for example  just by listening to someone telling you what to do with no kinesthetic experience  Could you solve simultaneous equations by talking them through in your head and without writing them down  Could you revise  for your architecture exams using interpretive dance if you're a kinesthetic learner  No. What you need to do  is match the material to be learned to the presentation format  not you. I know many of you are A level students that will have recently gotten your GCSE results. And if you didn't quite get what you were hoping for  then you can't really blame your learning style  but one thing that you might want to think about blaming is your genes. So what this is all about is a recent study at University College London found that    percent of the variation between different students and their GCSE results was down to genetic factors. That sounds like a very precise figure  so how can we tell  Well  when we want to unpack the relative contributions of genes and the environment  what we can do is do a twin study. So identical twins share     percent of their environment and     percent of their genes  whereas non identical twins share     percent of their environment  but just like any brother and sister  share only    percent of their genes. So by comparing how similar GCSE results are in identical twins versus non identical twins  and doing some clever math  we can an idea of how much variation and performance is due to the environment and how much is due to genes. And it turns out that it's about    percent due to genes. So this isn't to undermine the hard work that you and your teachers here put in. If you didn't quite get the GCSE results that you were hoping for  then you can always try blaming your parents  or at least their genes. One thing that you shouldn't blame is being a left brained or right brained learner  because again  this is a myth. So the myth here is that the left brain is logical  it's good with equations like this  and the right brain is more creative  so the right brain is better at music. But again  this is a myth because nearly everything that you do involves nearly all parts of your brain talking together  even just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation. However  perhaps one reason why this myth has survived is that there is a slight grain of truth to it. So a related version of the myth is that left handed people are more creative than right handed people  which kind of makes sense because your brain controls the opposite hands  so left handed people  the right side of the brain is slightly more active than the left hand side of the brain  and the idea is the right hand side is more creative. Now  it isn't true per se that left handed people are more creative than right handed people. What is true that ambidextrous people  or people who use both hands for different tasks  are more creative thinkers than one handed people  because being ambidextrous involves having both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot  which seems to be involved in creating flexible thinking. The myth of the creative left hander arises from the fact that being ambidextrous is more common amongst  left handers than right handers  so a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left hander  but not much. A related myth that you've probably heard of is that we only use    percent of our brains. This is  again  a complete myth. Nearly everything that we do  even the most mundane thing  uses nearly all of our brains. That said  it is of course true that most of us don't use our brainpower quite as well as we could. So what could we do to boost our brainpower  Maybe we could listen to a nice bit of Mozart. Have you heard of the idea of the Mozart effect  So the idea is that listening  to Mozart makes you smarter and improves your  performance on I.Q. tests. Now again  what's interesting about this myth is that although it's basically a myth  there is a grain of truth to it. So the original study found that participants who were played Mozart music for a few minutes did better on a subsequent I.Q. test than participants who simply sat in silence. But a follow up study recruited some people who liked Mozart music and then another group of people who were fans of  the horror stories of Stephen King. And they played the people the music or the stories. The people who preferred Mozart music to the stories got a bigger I.Q. boost from the Mozart than the stories  but the people who preferred the stories to the Mozart music got a bigger I.Q. boost from listening to the Stephen King stories than the Mozart music. So the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost on a narrow range of tasks. There's no suggestion that listening to Mozart  or indeed Stephen King stories  is going to make you any smarter in the long run. Another version of the Mozart myth is that listening to Mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier  too. Unfortunately  this doesn't seem to be true of someone who listened to the music of Mozart almost every day  Mozart himself  who suffered from gonorrhea  smallpox  arthritis  and  what most people think eventually killed him in the end  syphilis. This suggests that Mozart should have bit more careful  perhaps  when choosing his sexual partners. But how do we choose a partner  So a myth that I have to say is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists is that our preferences in a romantic  partner are a product of our culture  that they're very culturally specific. But in fact  the data don't back this up. A famous study surveyed people from      different cultures across the globe  from Americans to Zulus  on what they look for in a partner. And in every single culture across the globe  men placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner than did women  and in every single culture  too  women placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power. In every culture  too  men preferred women who were younger than themselves  an average of  I think it was  .   years  and in every culture  too  women preferred men who were older than them  so an average of  .   years  which is why we've got here  Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy.  So moving on from trying to score with a partner to trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is. The myth here is that sportsmen go through hot hand streaks  Americans call them  or purple patches  we sometimes say in England  where they just can't miss  like this guy here. But in fact  what happens is that if you analyze the pattern of hits and misses statistically  it turns out that it's nearly always at random. Your brain creates patterns from the randomness. If you toss a coin  a streak of heads or tails is going  to come out somewhere in the randomness  and because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none  we look at these streaks and attribute meanings to them and say   Yeah he's really on form today   whereas actually you would get the same pattern if you were just getting hits and misses at random. So an exception to this  however  is penalty shootouts. A recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football shows that players who represent countries with a very bad record in penalty shootouts  like  for example  England  tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record  and presumably as a result  they're more likely to miss. Which raises the question of if there's any way that we could improve people's performance. And one thing you might think about doing is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them. This idea  the effect that punishment can improve performance  is what participants thought they were testing in Milgram's famous learning and punishment experiment that you've probably heard about if you're a psychology student. The story goes that participants were prepared to give what they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant when they got a question wrong  just because someone in a white coat told them to. But this story is a myth for three reasons. Firstly and most crucially  the lab coat wasn't white  it was in fact grey. Secondly  the participants were told before the study and reminded any time they raised a concern  that although the shocks were painful  they were not fatal and indeed caused no permanent damage whatsoever. And thirdly  participants didn't give the shocks just because someone in the coat told them to. When they were interviewed after the study  all the participants said that they firmly believed that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose which would have enduring gains for science as opposed to the momentary nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants. Okay  so I've been talking for about    minutes now  and you've probably been  sitting there listening to me  analyzing my speech patterns  and body language and trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I'm saying  whether I'm telling the truth or whether I'm lying  but if so you've probably completely failed  because although we all think we can catch a liar from their body language and speech patterns  hundreds of psychological tests over the years have shown that all of us  including police officers and detectives  are basically at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language and verbal patterns. Interestingly  there is one exception  TV appeals for missing relatives. It's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing and when the appealers have in fact murdered the relatives themselves. So hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads  to look away  and to make errors in their speech  whereas genuine appealers are more likely to express hope that the person will return safely and to avoid brutal language. So  for example  they might say  taken from us  rather than  killed.  Speaking of which  it's about time I killed this talk  but before I do  I just want  to give you in    seconds the overarching myth of psychology. So the myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories  all of which say something useful and all of which have something to offer. What I hope to have shown you in the past few minutes is that this isn't true. What we need to do is assess psychological theories by seeing what predictions they make  whether that is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter  that you learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style or whatever it is  all of these are testable empirical predictions  and the only way we can make progress is to test these predictions against the data in tightly controlled experimental studies. And it's only by doing so that we can hope to discover which of these theories are well supported  and which  like all the ones I've told you about today  are myths. Thank you. Some years ago  I stumbled across a simple design exercise that helps people understand and solve complex problems  and like many of these design exercises  it kind of seems trivial at first  but under deep inspection  it turns out that it reveals unexpected truths about the way that we collaborate and make sense of things. The exercise has three parts and begins with something that we all know how to do  which is how to make toast. It begins with a clean sheet of paper  a felt marker  and without using any words  you begin to draw how to make toast. And most people draw something like this. They draw a loaf of bread   which is sliced  then put into a toaster. The toast is then deposited for some time. It pops up  and then voila  After two minutes  toast and happiness. Now  over the years  I've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts  and some of them are very good  because they really illustrate the toast making process quite clearly. And then there are some that are  well  not so good. They really suck  actually  because you don't know what they're trying to say. Under close inspection  some reveal some aspects of toast making while hiding others. So there's some that are all about the toast  and all about the transformation of toast. And there's others that are all about the toaster  and the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this. And then there are others that are about people. It's about visualizing the experience that people have. And then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast that goes all the way back to the store. It goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation and all the way back to the field and wheat  and one all actually goes all the way back to the Big Bang. So it's crazy stuff. But I think it's obvious that even though these drawings are really wildly different  they share a common quality  and I'm wondering if you can see it. Do you see it  What's common about these  Most drawings have nodes and links. So nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people  and links represent the connections between the nodes. And it's the combination of links and nodes that produces a full systems model  and it makes our private mental models visible about how we think something works. So that's the value of these things. What's interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view. So for example  Americans make toast with a toaster. That seems obvious. Whereas many Europeans make toast with a frying pan  of course  and many students make toast with a fire. I don't really understand this. A lot of MBA students do this. So you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes  and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes. Less than that  the drawing seems trivial  but it's quick to understand  and more than     the drawing produces a feeling of map shock. It's too complex. So the sweet spot is between   and   . So if you want to communicate something visually  have between five and    nodes in your diagram. So though we may not be skilled at drawing  the point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things into simple things and then  bring them back together again. So this brings us to our second part of  the exercise  which is how to make toast  but now with sticky notes or with cards. So what happens then  Well  with cards  most people tend to draw clear  more detailed  and more logical nodes. You can see the step by step analysis that takes place  and as they build up their model  they move their nodes around  rearranging them like Lego blocks. Now  though this might seem trivial  it's actually really important. This rapid iteration of expressing and then reflecting and analyzing is really the only way in which we get clarity. It's the essence of the design process. And systems theorists do tell us that the ease with which we can change a representation correlates to our willingness to improve the model. So sticky note systems are not only more fluid  they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings. The drawings are much richer. And this brings us to our third part of the exercise  which is to draw how to make toast  but this time in a group. So what happens then  Well  here's what happens. It starts out messy  and then it gets really messy  and then it gets messier  but as people refine the models  the best nodes become more prominent  and with each iteration  the model becomes clearer because people build on top of each other's ideas. What emerges is a unified systems model that integrates the diversity of everyone's individual points of view  so that's a really different outcome from what usually happens  in meetings  isn't it  So these drawings can contain    or more nodes  but participants don't feel map shock because they participate in the building of their models themselves. Now  what's also really interesting  that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it. To deal with contradictions  for example  they add branching patterns and parallel patterns. Oh  and by the way  if they do it in complete silence  they do it much better and much more quickly. Really interesting    talking gets in the way. So here's some key lessons that can emerge from this. First  drawing helps us understand the situations as systems with nodes and their relationships. Movable cards produce better systems models  because we iterate much more fluidly. And then the group notes produce  the most comprehensive models because we synthesize several points of view. So that's interesting. When people work together under the right circumstances  group models are much better than individual models. So this approach works really great for drawing how to make toast  but what if you wanted to draw something more relevant or pressing  like your organizational vision  or customer experience  or long term sustainability  There's a visual revolution that's taking place as more organizations are addressing their wicked problems by collaboratively drawing them out. And I'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge. And the practice is really pretty simple. You start with a question  you collect the nodes  you refine the nodes  you do it over again  you refine and refine and refine  and the patterns emerge  and the group gets clarity and you answer the question. So this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again produces some really remarkable outcomes. What's really important to know is that it's the conversations that are the important aspects  not just the models themselves. And these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes. So  one example is from an organization called Rodale. Big publishing company. They lost a bunch of money one year  and their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice. And what's interesting is that after visualizing the entire business  systems upon systems  they reclaimed     million dollars of revenue  and they also moved from a D rating  to an A rating from their customers. Why  Because there's alignment from the executive team. So I'm now on a mission to help organizations solve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization  and on a site that I've produced called drawtoast.com  I've collected a bunch of best practices. and so you can learn how to run a workshop here  you can learn more about the visual language and the structure of links and nodes that you can apply to general problem solving  and download examples of various templates for unpacking the thorny problems that we all face in our organizations. So the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast helps us get clear  engaged and aligned. So next time you're confronted with an interesting challenge  remember what design has to teach us. Make your ideas visible  tangible  and consequential. It's simple  it's fun  it's powerful  and I believe it's an idea worth celebrating. Thank you. I'm an artist and I cut books. This is one of my first book works. It's called  Alternate Route to Knowledge.  I wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they're just looking at a regular stack of books  but then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it  and wonder what was happening  wonder why  and think about the material of the book. So I'm interested in the texture  but I'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books. In most of my work  what I do is I seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish so it's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book so it becomes a solid material  but then the pages inside are still loose  and then I carve into the surface of the book  and I'm not moving or adding anything. I'm just carving around whatever I find interesting. So everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before I began. I think of my work as sort of a remix  in a way  because I'm working with somebody else's material in the same way that a D.J. might be working with somebody else's music. This was a book of Raphael paintings  the Renaissance artist  and by taking his work and remixing it  carving into it  I'm sort of making it into something that's more new and more contemporary. I'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book and pushing that linear format  and try to push the structure of the book itself so that the book can become fully sculptural. I'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials  weights  in order to hold things  in place before I varnish so that I can push the form  before I begin  so that something like this can become a piece like this  which is just made from a single dictionary. Or something like this can become a piece like this. Or something like this  which who knows what that's going to be or why that's in my studio  will become a piece like this. So I think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books  people don't want to rip books and nobody really wants to throw away a book  is that we think about books as living things  we think about them as a body  and they're created to relate to our body  as far as scale  but they also have the potential to continue to grow and to continue to become new things. So books really are alive. So I think of the book as a body  and I think of the book as a technology. I think of the book as a tool. And I also think of the book as a machine. I also think of the book as a landscape. This is a full set of encyclopedias that's been connected and sanded together  and as I carve through it  I'm deciding what I want to choose. So with encyclopedias  I could have chosen anything  but I specifically chose images of landscapes. And with the material itself  I'm using sandpaper and sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape  but the material itself suggests a landscape as well. So one of the things I do is when I'm carving through the book  I'm thinking about images  but I'm also thinking about text  and I think about them in a very similar way  because what's interesting is that when we're reading text  when we're reading a book  it puts images in our head  so we're sort of filling that piece. We're sort of creating images when we're reading text  and when we're looking at an image  we actually use language in order to understand what we're looking at. So there's sort of a yin yang that happens  sort of a flip flop. So I'm creating a piece that the viewer is completing themselves. And I think of my work as almost an archaeology. I'm excavating and I'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as I possibly can and exposing it within my own work. But at the same time  I'm thinking about this idea of erasure  and what's happening now that most of our information is intangible  and this idea of loss  and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers  but the information itself  now that we don't have a physical backup  has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it. And I have several dictionaries in my own studio  and I do use a computer every day  and if I need to look up a word  I'll go on the computer  because I can go directly and instantly to what I'm looking up. I think that the book was never really the right format for nonlinear information  which is why we're seeing reference books becoming the first to be  endangered or extinct. So I don't think that the book will ever really die. People think that now that we have digital technology  the book is going to die  and we are seeing things shifting and things evolving. I think that the book will evolve  and just like people said painting would die when photography and printmaking became everyday materials  but what it really allowed painting to do was it allowed painting to quit its day job. It allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story  and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story  and that's when we saw Modernism emerge  and we saw painting go into different branches. And I think that's what's happening with books now  now that most of our technology  most of our information  most of our personal and cultural  records are in digital form  I think it's really allowing the book to become something new. So I think it's a very exciting time for an artist like me  and it's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future. Thank you. So infectious diseases  right  Infectious diseases  are still the main cause of human suffering and death  around the world. Every year  millions of people die of diseases such as T.B.  malaria  HIV  around the world  and even in the United States. Every year  thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu. Now of course  humans  we are creative. Right  We have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases. We have drugs and vaccines. And we're conscious    we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions. We used to think we're alone in this  but now we know we're not. We're not the only medical doctors. Now we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too. Most famous  perhaps  chimpanzees. Not so much different from us  they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites. But the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too  elephants  porcupines  sheep  goats  you name it. And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too. The problem with infectious diseases  as we all know  is that pathogens continue to evolve  and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy. And therefore  there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases. Now  I think that we should look at these animals  and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases. As a biologist  I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last    years. Now  monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations from the U.S. and Canada down to Mexico every year  where millions of them come together  but it's not why I started studying them. I study monarchs because they get sick. They get sick like you. They get sick like me. And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans. Now  the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha    a mouthful. What they do is they produce spores  millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly. And this is really detrimental to the monarch. It shortens their lifespan  it reduces their ability to fly  it can even kill them before they're even adults. Very detrimental parasite. As part of my job  I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants  and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters. They only eat milkweed as larvae. Luckily  there are several species of milkweed that they can use  and all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them. These are chemicals that are toxic. They're toxic to most animals  but not to monarchs. In fact  monarchs can take up the chemicals  put it in their own bodies  and it makes them toxic against their predators  such as birds. And what they do  then  is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange  black and white. So what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse  different ones  different milkweeds. Some were toxic  including the tropical milkweed  with very high concentrations of these cardenolides. And some were not toxic. And then I fed them to monarchs. Some of the monarchs were healthy. They had no disease. But some of the monarchs were sick  and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal  meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies  meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants. And when I found this  I had this idea  and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea  but I thought   what if monarchs can use this  What if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine  What if they can act as medical doctors  So my team and I started doing experiments. In the first types of experiments  we had caterpillars  and gave them a choice  medicinal milkweed versus non medicinal milkweed. And then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime. And the result  as so often  in science  was boring  Fifty percent of their food was medicinal. Fifty percent was not. These caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare. So then we moved on to adult butterflies  and we started asking the question whether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring. Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick  We have done these experiments now over several years  and always get the same results. What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage  a medicinal plant on one side  a non medicinal plant on the other side  and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant. And what we find when we do that is always the same. What we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed. In other words  what these females are doing is they're laying    percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed. Intriguingly  what they do is they actually transmit the parasites when they're laying the eggs. They cannot prevent this. They can also not medicate themselves. But what these experiments tell us is that these monarchs  these mothers  can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick. Now  this is a really important discovery  I think  not just because it tells us something cool about nature  but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs. Now  these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple. They have tiny little brains  yet they can do this very sophisticated medication. Now  we know that even today  most of our drugs derive from natural products  including plants  and in indigenous cultures  traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs. In this way  elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset  and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea. What I think is important   though  is to move beyond these large brained mammals and give these guys more credit  these simple animals  these insects that we tend to think of as very  very simple with tiny little brains. The discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues  and I think that maybe one day  we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies  and I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing. Thank you so much. On Mondays and Thursdays  I learn how to die. I call them my terminal days. My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term  but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it. And I kept thinking  one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says   Ricardo  things don't look very good. You have six months or a year to live.  And you start thinking about what you would do with this time. And you say   I'm going to spend  more time with the kids. I'm going to visit these places  I'm going to go up and down mountains and places and I'm going to do all the things I didn't do when I had the time.  But of course  we all know these are very bittersweet memories  we're going to have. It's very difficult to do. You spend a good part of the time crying  probably. So I said  I'm going to do something else. Every Monday and Thursday  I'm going use my terminal days. And I will do  during those days  whatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news. When you think about    when you think about the opposite of work  we  many times  think it's leisure. And you say  ah  I need  some leisure time  and so forth. But the fact is that  leisure is a very busy thing. You go play golf and tennis  and you meet people  and you're going for lunch  and you're late for the movies. It's a very crowded thing that we do. The opposite of work is idleness. But very few of us know what to do with idleness. When you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general  you realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money  we have very little time. And then when we finally have time  we have neither the money nor the health. So we started thinking about that as a company for the last    years. This is a complicated company with thousands of employees  hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes rocket fuel propellent systems  runs       ATMs in Brazil  does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands. So this is not a simple business. We looked at it and we said  let's devolve to these people  let's give these people a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of  this is when you arrive  this is how you dress  this is how you go to meetings  this is what you say  this is what you don't say  and let's see what's left. So we started this about    years ago  and we started dealing with this very issue. And so we said  look  the retirement  the whole issue of how  we distribute our graph of life. Instead of going mountain climbing when you're     why don't you do it next week  And we'll do it like this  we'll sell you back your Wednesdays for    percent of your salary. So now  if you were going to be  a violinist  which you probably weren't  you go and do this on Wednesday. And what we found    we thought  these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program. And the average age of the first people who adhered were     of course. And so we started looking  and we said  we have to do things in a different way. So we started saying things like  why do we want to know what time you came to work  what time you left  etc.  Can't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you  some kind of work  Why are we building these headquarters  Is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important  But we're dragging you two hours across town because of it  So we started asking questions one by one. We'd say it like this  One  How do we find people  We'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say  look  when you come to us  we're not going to have two or three interviews and then you're going to be married to us for life. That's not how we do  the rest of our lives. So  come have your interviews. Anyone who's interested in interviewing  you will show up. And then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that  instead of just filling out the little  items of whether you're the right person. And then  come back. Spend an afternoon  spend a whole day  talk to anybody you want. Make sure we are the bride  you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads. Slowly we went to a process  where we'd say things like  we don't want anyone to be a leader in the company if they haven't been  interviewed and approved by their future subordinates. Every six months  everyone gets  evaluated  anonymously  as a leader. And this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position  which is many times situational  as you know. And so if they don't have        percent  of a grade  they don't stay  which is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than    years. And over time  we started asking other questions. We said things like  why can't people set their own salaries  What do they need to know  There's only three things  you need to know  how much people make inside the company  how much people make somewhere else in a similar business and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it. So let's give people these three pieces of information. So we started having  in the cafeteria  a computer where you could go in  and you could ask what someone spent   how much someone makes  what they make in benefits   what the company makes  what the margins are  and so forth. And this is    years ago. As this information started  coming to people  we said things like  we don't want  to see your expense report  we don't want to know how many  holidays you're taking  we don't want to know where you work. We had  at one point     different offices around town  and we'd say  go to the one  that's closest to your house  to the customer that  you're going to visit today. Don't tell us where you are. And more  even when we had thousands of people        people  we had two people in the H.R. department  and thankfully one of them has retired. And so  the question we were asking was  how can we be taking care of people  People are the only thing we have. We can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people. So as we started finding that this worked  and we'd say  we're looking for    and this is  I think  the main thing I was looking for in the terminal days and in the company  which is  how do you set up for wisdom  We've come from an age of revolution  industrial revolution  an age of information  an age of knowledge  but we're not any closer to the age of wisdom. How we design  how do we organize  for more wisdom  So for example  many times  what's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive. So we'd say things like  let's agree that you're going to sell    widgets per week. If you sell them by Wednesday   please go to the beach. Don't create a problem for us   for manufacturing  for application  then we have to buy new companies  we have to buy our competitors  we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets. So go to the beach and start again on Monday. So the process is looking for wisdom. And in the process  of course   we wanted people to know everything  and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things. So our board had two seats open  with the same voting rights  for the first two people who showed up. And so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting  which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties. And the fact is that they kept us honest. This process  as we started looking at the people who came to us  we'd say  now wait a second  people come to us and they say  where am I supposed to sit  How am I supposed to work  Where am I going to be in   years' time  And we looked at that and we said  we have to start much earlier. Where do we start  We said  oh  kindergarten  seems like a good place. So we set up a foundation  which now has   for    years  three schools  where we started asking the same questions  how do you redesign school for wisdom  It is one thing to say  we need to recycle the teachers  we need the directors to do more. But the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete. The teacher's role is entirely obsolete. Going from a math class  to biology  to   th century France is very silly. So we started thinking   what could it look like  And we put together people   including people who like education  people like Paulo Freire   and two ministers of education in Brazil and we said  if we were to design a school from scratch  what would it look like  And so we created this school  which is called Lumiar  and Lumiar  one of them is a public school  and Lumiar says the following  Let's divide this role of the teacher into two. One guy  we'll call a tutor. A tutor  in the old sense of the Greek  paideia   Look after the kid. What's happening at home  what's their moment in life  etc.. But please don't teach  because the little you know compared  to Google  we don't want to know. Keep that to yourself. Now  we'll bring in people who have two things  passion and expertise  and it could be their profession or not. And we use the senior citizens  who are    percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore. So we bring them to school and we say  teach these kids whatever you really believe in. So we have violinists teaching math. We have all kinds of things where we say  don't worry about  the course material anymore. We have approximately    great threads that go from   to   . Things like  how do we measure ourselves as humans  So there's a place for math and physics and all that there. How do we express ourselves  So there's a place for music and literature  etc.  but also for grammar. And then we have things that everyone has forgotten  which are probably the most  important things in life. The very important things in life  we know nothing about. We know nothing about love  we know nothing about death  we know nothing about why we're here. So we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know. So that's a big part of what we do. So over the years  we started going into other things. We'd say  why do we have to scold the kids and say  sit down and come here  and do that  and so forth. We said  let's get the kids to do  something we call a circle  which meets once a week. And we'd say  you put the rules together and then you decide what you want to do with it. So can you all hit yourself on the head  Sure  for a week  try. They came up with the very same rules that we had  except they're theirs. And then  they have the power  which means  they can and do suspend and expel kids so that we're not playing school  they really decide. And then  in this same vein  we keep a digital mosaic  because this is not constructivist or Montessori or something. It's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum with     tiles of a mosaic  which we want to expose these kids to by the time they're   . And follow this all the time and we know how they're doing and we say  you're not interested  in this now  let's wait a year. And the kids are in groups that don't have an age category  so the six year old kid who is ready for that with an    year old  that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have  in the schools  in general. And they have a zero  to     percent grading  which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours. Until we know they're    percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue  so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it. And so the courses are World Cup Soccer  or building a bicycle. And people will sign up for  a    day course on building a bicycle. Now  try to build a bicycle without  knowing that pi is  .    . You can't. And try  any one of you   using  .     for something. You don't know anymore. So this is lost and that's what  we try to do there  which is looking  for wisdom in that school. And that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life. I accumulated a lot of money  when I think about it. When you think and you say  now is the time to give back    well  if you're giving back   you took too much. I keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day and finding out he has    billion dollars more than he thought he had. And he looks and he says  what am I going to do with this  And he says  I'll give it to someone who really needs this. I'll give it to Bill Gates.  Laughter  And my guy  who's my financial advisor in New York  he says  look  you're a silly guy because you would have  .  times  more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go. But I like sharing as you go better. I taught MBAs at MIT for a time and I ended up  one day  at the Mount Auburn Cemetery. It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge. And I was walking around. It was my birthday and I was thinking. And the first time around   I saw these tombstones and these wonderful people  who'd done great things and I thought  what do I want  to be remembered for  And I did another stroll around  and the second time  another question came to me  which did me better  which was  why do I want to be remembered at all  And that  I think   took me different places. When I was     my wife Fernanda and I sat for a whole afternoon  we had a big pit with fire  and I threw everything I had ever  done into that fire. This is a book in    languages  hundreds and hundreds of articles and DVDs  everything there was. And that did two things. One  it freed our five kids from following in our steps  our shadow    They don't know what I do. Which is good. And I'm not going to take them somewhere and say  one day  all of this will be yours. The five kids know nothing  which is good. And the second thing is  I freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever. I'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days. And some people would say  oh  so now you have this time  these terminal days  and so you go out and do everything. No  we've been to the beaches  so we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique  so that's done. I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas. I've gone down    meters to see  hammerhead sharks. I've spent    days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu. I've gone to the magnetic  North Pole on a dog sled. So  we've been busy. It's what I'd like to call  my empty bucket list. And with this rationale  I look at these days and I think  I'm not retired.  I don't feel retired at all. And so I'm writing a new book. We started three new companies in the last two years. I'm now working on getting this  school system for free out into the world  and I've found  very interestingly enough  that nobody wants it for free. And so I've been trying for    years to get the public system to take over this school rationale  much as the public schools we have  which has instead of    out of      as their rating  as their grades  has    out of    . But for free  nobody wants it. So maybe we'll start charging for it  and then it will go somewhere. But getting this out is one of the things we want to do. And I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you  I think is a little bit like this  We've all learned how to go on Sunday night to email and work from home. But very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon. And if we're looking for wisdom  we need to learn to do that as well. And so  what we've done all of these years is very simple  is use the little tool  which is ask three whys in a row. Because the first why you always have a good answer for. The second why  it starts getting difficult. By the third why  you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing. What I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this  you will come to the question  what for  What am I doing this for  And hopefully  as a result of that  and over time  I hope that with this  and that's what I'm wishing you  you'll have a much wiser future. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So Ricardo   you're kind of crazy. To many people  this seems crazy. And yet so deeply wise  also. The pieces I'm trying to put together are this  Your ideas are so radical. How  in business  for example  these ideas have been out for a while  probably the percentage of businesses  that have taken some of them is still quite low. Are there any times you've seen  some big company take on one of your ideas  and you've gone   Yes    Ricardo Semler  It happens. It happened about two weeks ago with Richard Branson  with his people saying  oh  I don't want to control your holidays anymore  or Netflix does a little bit of this and that  but I don't think it's very important. I'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal  but that's a very personal one. But the fact is that it takes a leap  of faith about losing control. And almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith. It will have to come from kids  and other people who are starting companies  in a different way. CA  So that's the key thing  From your point of view the evidence is there  in the business point of view this works  but people just don't have the courage to     Whoosh  RS  They don't even have the incentive. You're running a company with a    day mandate. It's a quarterly report. If you're not good in    days  you're out. So you say   Here's a great program that  in less than one generation     And the guy says   Get out of here.  So this is the problem. CA  What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound. Everyone is bothered about their country's education system. No one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world where there's Google and all these  technological options. So you've got actual evidence now that  the kids so far going through your system  there's a dramatic increase  in performance. How do we help you move these ideas forward  RS  I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come. And I've never been very evangelical about these things. We put it out there. Suddenly  you find people    there's a group in Japan   which scares me very much  which is called the Semlerists  and they have     companies. They've invited me. I've always been scared to go. And there is a group in Holland that has     small  Dutch companies. It's something that will flourish on its own. Part of it will be wrong   and it doesn't matter. This will find its own place. And I'm afraid of the other one  which says  this is so good you've got to do this. Let's set up a system  and put lots of money into it and then people will do it no matter what. CA  So you have asked  extraordinary questions your whole life. It seems to me that's the fuel  that's driven a lot of this. Do you have any other questions for us  for TED  for this group here  RS  I always come back  to variations of the question that my son asked me when he was three. We were sitting in a jacuzzi  and he said   Dad  why do we exist   There is no other question. Nobody has any other question. We have variations of this one question  from three onwards. So when you spend time in a company  in a bureaucracy  in an organization and you're saying  boy    how many people do you know who on their death beds said  boy  I wish I had spent more time at the office  So there's a whole thing  of having the courage now    not in a week  not in two months  not when you find out  you have something    to say  no  what am I doing this for  Stop everything. Let me do something else. And it will be okay  it will be much better than what you're doing  if you're stuck in a process. CA  So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of TED. Ricardo Semler  thank you so much. RS  Thank you so much. What's the fastest growing threat to Americans' health  Cancer  Heart attacks  Diabetes  The answer is actually none of these  it's Alzheimer's disease. Every    seconds  someone in the United States is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. As the number of Alzheimer's patients triples by the year       caring for them  as well as the rest of the aging population  will become an overwhelming societal challenge. My family has experienced firsthand the struggles of caring for an Alzheimer's patient. Growing up in a family with three generations  I've always been very close to my grandfather. When I was four years old  my grandfather and I  were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost. It was one of the scariest moments I've ever experienced in my life  and it was also the first instance that informed us that my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease. Over the past    years  his condition got worse and worse  and his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress. My aunt  his primary caregiver  really struggled to stay awake at night to keep an eye on him  and even then often failed to catch him leaving the bed. I became really concerned about my aunt's well being as well as my grandfather's safety. I searched extensively for a solution that could help my family's problems  but couldn't find one. Then  one night about two years ago  I was looking after my grandfather and I saw him stepping out of the bed. The moment his foot landed on the floor  I thought  why don't I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot  Once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed  the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver's smartphone. That way  my aunt could sleep much better at night without having to worry about my grandfather's wandering. So now I'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock. Could I please have my sock model on the stage  Great. So once the patient steps onto the floor    an alert is sent to the caregiver's smartphone. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  sock model. So this is a drawing of my preliminary design. My desire to create a sensor based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology. When I was six years old  an elderly family friend fell down in the bathroom and suffered severe injuries. I became concerned about my own grandparents and decided to invent a smart bathroom system. Motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom. Since I was only six years old at the time and I hadn't graduated from kindergarten yet  I didn't have the necessary resources and  tools to translate my idea into reality  but nonetheless  my research experience really implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people. I really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly. When I laid out my plan  I realized that I faced three main challenges  first  creating a sensor  second  designing a circuit  and third  coding a smartphone app. This made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize than I initially had thought it to be. First  I had to create a wearable sensor that was thin and flexible enough to be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient's foot. After extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber  which I realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot  I decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure sensitive ink particles. Once pressure is applied  the connectivity between the particles increases. Therefore  I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance. Next  I had to design a wearable wireless circuit  but wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power and requires heavy  bulky batteries. Thankfully  I was able to find out about the Bluetooth low energy technology  which consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin sized battery. This prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night. Lastly  I had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform the care giver's smartphone into a remote monitor. For this  I had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode and I also had to learn about how to code for Bluetooth low energy devices by watching YouTube tutorials and reading various textbooks. Integrating these components  I was able to successfully create two prototypes  one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock  and another that's a re attachable sensor assembly that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact with the bottom of the patient's foot. I've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now  and it's had a     percent success rate in detecting the over      known cases of his wandering. Last summer  I was able to beta test my device at several residential care facilities in California  and I'm currently incorporating the feedback to further improve the device  into a marketable product. Testing the device on a number of patients made me realize that I needed to invent solutions for people who didn't want to wear socks to sleep at night. So sensor data  collected on a vast number of patients  can be useful for improving patient care and also leading to a cure for the disease  possibly. For example  I'm currently examining correlations between the frequency of a patient's nightly wandering and his or her daily activities and diet. One thing I'll never forget is when my device first caught my grandfather's wandering out of bed at night. At that moment  I was really struck by the power of technology to change lives for the better. People living happily and healthfully    that's the world that I imagine. Thank you very much. Today I want to talk to you about the mathematics of love. Now  I think that we can all agree that mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love. But it's not just because of our dashing personalities  superior conversational skills and excellent pencil cases. It's also because we've actually done an awful lot of work into the maths of how to find the perfect partner. Now  in my favorite paper on the subject  which is entitled   Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend      Laughter     Peter Backus tries to rate his chances of finding love. Now  Peter's not a very greedy man. Of all of the available women in the U.K.  all Peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him  somebody in the right age range  somebody with a university degree  somebody he's likely to get on well with  somebody who's likely to be attractive  somebody who's likely  to find him attractive. And comes up with an estimate of    women in the whole of the UK. It's not looking very good   is it Peter  Now  just to put that into perspective  that's about     times fewer than the best estimates of how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms there are. And it also gives Peter a   in         chance of bumping into any one of these special ladies on a given night out. I'd like to think that's why mathematicians don't really bother going on nights out anymore. The thing is that I personally don't subscribe to such a pessimistic view. Because I know  just as well as all of you do  that love doesn't really work like that. Human emotion isn't neatly ordered and rational and easily predictable. But I also know that that doesn't mean that mathematics hasn't got something that it can offer us because  love  as with most of life  is full of patterns and mathematics is  ultimately  all about the study of patterns. Patterns from predicting the weather to the fluctuations in the stock market  to the movement of the planets or the growth of cities. And if we're being honest  none of those things are exactly neatly ordered and easily predictable  either. Because I believe that mathematics is so powerful that it has the potential to offer us a new way of looking at almost anything. Even something as mysterious as love. And so  to try to persuade you of how totally amazing  excellent and relevant mathematics is  I want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love. Okay  so Top Tip     How to win at online dating. So my favorite online dating  website is OkCupid  not least because it was started by a group of mathematicians. Now  because they're mathematicians  they have been collecting data on everybody who uses their site for almost a decade. And they've been trying  to search for patterns in the way that we talk about ourselves and the way that we  interact with each other on an online dating website. And they've come up with some seriously interesting findings. But my particular favorite is that it turns out that on an online dating website  how attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are  and actually  having people think that you're ugly can work to your advantage. Let me show you how this works. In a thankfully voluntary section of OkCupid  you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between   and  . Now  if we compare this score   the average score  to how many messages a selection of people receive  you can begin to get a sense of how attractiveness links to popularity on an online dating website. This is the graph that the OkCupid guys have come up with. And the important thing to notice is that it's not totally true that the more attractive you are  the more messages you get. But the question arises then of what is it about people up here who are so much more popular than people down here  even though they have the same score of attractiveness  And the reason why is that it's not just  straightforward looks that are important. So let me try to illustrate their findings with an example. So if you take someone like Portia de Rossi  for example  everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi is a very beautiful woman. Nobody thinks that she's ugly  but she's not a supermodel  either. If you compare Portia de Rossi to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker  now  a lot of people   myself included  I should say  think that Sarah Jessica Parker is seriously fabulous and possibly one of the most beautiful creatures to have ever have walked  on the face of the Earth. But some other people   i.e.  most of the Internet  seem to think that she looks  a bit like a horse.  Laughter  Now  I think that if you ask people how attractive they thought Sarah Jessica Parker  or Portia de Rossi were  and you ask them to give  them a score between   and    I reckon that they'd average out to have roughly the same score. But the way that people would vote would be very different. So Portia's scores would all be clustered around the   because everybody agrees  that she's very beautiful  whereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion. There'd be a huge spread in her scores. And actually it's this spread that counts. It's this spread that makes you more popular on an online Internet dating website. So what that means then is that if some people think that you're attractive  you're actually better off having some other people think that you're a massive minger. That's much better than everybody just thinking that you're the cute girl next door. Now  I think this begins  makes a bit more sense when you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages. So let's say that you think somebody's attractive  but you suspect that other people won't necessarily be that interested. That means there's less competition for you and it's an extra incentive for you to get in touch. Whereas compare that  to if you think somebody is attractive but you suspect that everybody  is going to think they're attractive. Well  why would you bother  humiliating yourself  let's be honest  Here's where the really interesting part comes. Because when people choose the pictures that they use on an online dating website  they often try to minimize the things that they think some people  will find unattractive. The classic example is people who are  perhaps  a little bit overweight deliberately choosing  a very cropped photo  or bald men  for example  deliberately choosing pictures where they're wearing hats. But actually this is the opposite  of what you should do if you want to be successful. You should really  instead  play up to  whatever it is that makes you different  even if you think that some people will find it unattractive. Because the people who fancy you are just going to fancy you anyway  and the unimportant losers who don't  well  they only play up to your advantage. Okay  Top Tip     How to pick the perfect partner. So let's imagine then that you're a roaring success on the dating scene. But the question arises  of how do you then convert that success into longer term happiness and in particular  how do you decide when is the right time to settle down  Now generally  it's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all. But  equally  you don't really  want to leave it too long if you want to maximize your  chance of long term happiness. As my favorite author   Jane Austen  puts it   An unmarried woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again.  Thanks a lot  Jane. What do you know about love  So the question is then  how do you know when  is the right time to settle down given all the people  that you can date in your lifetime  Thankfully  there's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use to help us out here  called optimal stopping theory. So let's imagine then  that you start dating when you're    and ideally  you'd like to be married by the time that you're   . And there's a number of people that you could potentially date across your lifetime  and they'll be at varying  levels of goodness. Now the rules are that once  you cash in and get married  you can't look ahead to see what you could have had  and equally  you can't go back and change your mind. In my experience at least  I find that typically people don't much like being recalled years after being passed up  for somebody else  or that's just me. So the math says then that what you should do in the first    percent  of your dating window  you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential. And then  you should pick the  next person that comes along that is better than everybody  that you've seen before. So here's the example. Now if you do this  it can be mathematically proven  in fact  that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances  of finding the perfect partner. Now unfortunately  I have to tell you that this method does come with some risks. For instance  imagine if  your perfect partner appeared during your first    percent. Now  unfortunately   you'd have to reject them. Now  if you're following the maths  I'm afraid no one else comes along that's better than anyone you've seen before  so you have to go on  rejecting everyone and die alone. Probably surrounded by cats nibbling at your remains. Okay  another risk is   let's imagine  instead  that the first people that you dated in your first    percent are just incredibly dull  boring  terrible people. Now  that's okay  because  you're in your rejection phase  so thats fine   you can reject them. But then imagine  the next person to come along is just marginally less boring   dull and terrible than everybody that you've seen before. Now  if you are following the maths  I'm afraid you have to marry them and end up in a relationship which is  frankly  suboptimal. Sorry about that. But I do think that there's an opportunity here for Hallmark to cash in on and really cater for this market. A Valentine's Day card like this.  Laughter   My darling husband  you are marginally less terrible than the first    percent of people I dated.  It's actually more romantic than I normally manage. Okay  so this method doesn't give you a     percent success rate  but there's no other possible strategy that can do any better. And actually  in the wild  there are certain types of fish which follow and employ this exact strategy. So they reject every possible  suitor that turns up in the first    percent  of the mating season  and then they pick the next fish that comes along after that window that's  I don't know  bigger and burlier than all of the fish  that they've seen before. I also think that subconsciously  humans  we do sort of do this anyway. We give ourselves a little bit of time to play the field  get a feel for the marketplace  or whatever when we're young. And then we only start looking seriously at potential marriage candidates once we hit our mid to late   s. I think this is conclusive proof  if ever it were needed  that everybody's brains are prewired  to be just a little bit mathematical. Okay  so that was Top Tip   . Now  Top Tip     How to avoid divorce. Okay  so let's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner and you're settling into a lifelong relationship with them. Now  I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce  apart from  I don't know   Piers Morgan's wife  maybe  But it's a sad fact of modern life that   in   marriages in the States ends in divorce  with the rest of the world not being far behind. Now  you can be forgiven  perhaps for thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation. For one thing  it's very hard to know what you should be measuring  or what you should be quantifying. But this didn't stop a psychologist  John Gottman  who did exactly that. Gottman observed hundreds of couples having a conversation and recorded  well   everything you can think of. So he recorded what was said  in the conversation  he recorded their skin conductivity  he recorded their facial expressions  their heart rates  their blood pressure  basically everything apart from whether or not the wife was actually always right  which incidentally she totally is. But what Gottman and his team found was that one of the most important predictors for whether or not a couple is going to get divorced was how positive or negative each  partner was being in the conversation. Now  couples that were very low risk scored a lot more positive points on Gottman's scale than negative. Whereas bad relationships  by which I mean  probably going to get divorced  they found themselves getting  into a spiral of negativity. Now just by using these very simple ideas  Gottman and his group were able to predict whether a given couple was going to get divorced with a    percent accuracy. But it wasn't until he teamed up with a mathematician  James Murray  that they really started to understand what causes these negativity spirals  and how they occur. And the results that they found I think are just incredibly impressively simple and interesting. So these equations  they predict how  the wife or husband is going to respond in their next turn of the conversation  how positive or negative they're going to be. And these equations  they depend on the mood of the person  when they're on their own  the mood of the person when they're with their partner  but most importantly  they depend on how much the husband and wife influence one another. Now  I think it's important  to point out at this stage  that these exact equations  have also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countries in an arms race. So that    an arguing couple spiraling into negativity and teetering on the brink of divorce    is actually mathematically equivalent to the beginning of a nuclear war. But the really important term in this equation is the influence that people have on one another  and in particular  something called  the negativity threshold. Now  the negativity threshold  you can think of as how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts to get  really pissed off  and vice versa. Now  I always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person to  have the space to be themselves. So I would have thought that perhaps the most successful relationships were ones where there was a really high negativity threshold. Where couples let things go and only brought things up if  they really were a big deal. But actually  the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true. The best couples  or the most successful couples  are the ones with a really low  negativity threshold. These are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other  some room to complain. These are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship  that have a much more positive outlook on their marriage. Couples that don't let things go and couples that don't let trivial things end up being a really big deal. Now of course  it takes bit more than  just a low negativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship. But I think that it's quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger. So those are my top three tips of how maths can help you with love and relationships. But I hope that aside from their use as tips  they also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics. Because for me  equations  and symbols aren't just a thing. They're a voice that speaks out about the incredible richness of nature and the startling simplicity in the patterns that twist and turn and warp and evolve all around us  from how the world works to how we behave. So I hope that perhaps  for just a couple of you  a little bit of insight into the mathematics of love can persuade you to have  a little bit more love for mathematics. Thank you. I grew up with my identical twin  who was an incredibly loving brother. Now  one thing about being a twin  is that it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even slightly bigger  than my cookie  I had questions. And clearly  I wasn't starving. When I became a psychologist  I began to notice favoritism of a different kind  and that is how much more we value the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university earning my doctorate in psychology  and I can't tell you how many people  look at my business card and say   Oh  a psychologist.  So not a real doctor   as if it should say that on my card. This favoritism we show the body  over the mind  I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house  and their five year old was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool  by the sink brushing his teeth  when he slipped  and scratched his leg  on the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute   but then he got back up  got back on the stool  and reached out for a box of Band Aids to put one on his cut. Now  this kid could barely  tie his shoelaces  but he knew you have to cover a cut  so it doesn't become infected  and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene  right  We've known it since we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health  Well  nothing. What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene  Nothing. How is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth than we do our minds. Why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health  We sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones  injuries like failure or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse if we ignore them  and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways. And yet  even though there are  scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries  we don't. It doesn't even occur to us  that we should.  Oh  you're feeling depressed  Just shake it off  it's all in your head.  Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg   Oh  just walk it off  it's all in your leg.  It is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal  more like twins. Speaking of which   my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor  either. We didn't study together  though. In fact  the hardest thing  I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic  to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then for the first time in our lives  and the separation was  brutal for both of us. But while he remained among family and friends  I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly  but international phone calls were really expensive then and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around  it was the first we wouldn't be spending together. We decide to splurge  and that week we would talk for    minutes. I spent the morning pacing around my room  waiting for him to call    and waiting and waiting   but the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference  I assumed   Ok  he's out with friends   he will call later.  There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize that after  being away for over    months  he no longer missed me  the way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning  but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone  and  I realized I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out off bed  I put the phone back on the receiver  and it rang a second later  and it was my brother  and  boy  was he pissed. It was the saddest and longest  night of his life as well. Now I tried to explain what happened  but he said   I don't understand.  If you saw I wasn't calling you  why didn't you just pick up  the phone and call me   He was right. Why didn't I call him  I didn't have an answer then  but I do today  and it's a simple one  loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound  one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out  because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand  I was in the grips of real  loneliness back then  but I was surrounded by people all day  so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined  purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness  and all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable  it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases your  likelihood of an early death by    percent. Loneliness causes high blood pressure  high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning of your immune system  making you vulnerable to all kinds  of illnesses and diseases. In fact  scientists have concluded  that taken together  chronic loneliness poses as  significant a risk for your longterm health and  longevity as cigarette smoking. Now cigarette packs come with warnings saying   This could kill you.  But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize our psychological health  that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat  a psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only  psychological wound that distorts our perceptions  and misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center  where I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button  and a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling the purple button  then pushing it  and then she just sat back and looked  at the box  with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her  watched this happen  then turned to his box and and burst  into tears without even touching it. Meanwhile  another little girl tried  everything she could think of until she slid the red button  the cute doggie popped out  and she squealed with delight. So three toddlers with  identical plastic toys  but with very different  reactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not. Now  adults get tricked this way  as well  all the time. In fact  we all have a default set of  feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter  frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how  your mind reacts to failure  You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something and you believe it  then like those two toddlers  you'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon  or you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more  convinced you can't succeed. You see  that's why so many people function below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way   sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't  succeed  and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something  it's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends  down a dark road at night  when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car  and he shined his flashlight on the driver  then on my brother in the front seat  and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said   Where have I seen your face before   And I said   In the front seat.  But that made no sense to him whatsoever. So now he thought I was on drugs. So he drags me out of the car  he searches me  he marches me over to the police car  and only when he verified I didn't have a police record  could I show him  I had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away   you could see by the look on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. Our mind is hard to change  once we become convinced. So it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself to become  convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight  feelings of helplessness. You have to gain control over the situation. And you have to break this kind of  negative cycle before it begins. Our minds and our feelings  they're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were. They are more like a really moody friend  who can be totally supportive one minute  and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman who after    years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce  was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online  and he seemed nice and he seemed successful  and most importantly   he seemed really into her. So she was very excited   she bought a new dress  and they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date   the man stands up and says   I'm not interested   and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.  All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said   Well  what do you expect  You have big hips  you have nothing interesting to say  why would a handsome   successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you   Shocking  right  that a friend  could be so cruel  But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't  the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do   especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings  what we wish we were   what we wish we weren't  we call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly  but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do  because our self esteem is already hurting. Why would we want to go  and damage it even further  We wouldn't make a physical injury  worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm  and decide   Oh  I know  I'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper I can make it.  But we do that with psychological injuries all the time. Why  Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize  our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies that when your self esteem is lower  you are more vulnerable to  stress and to anxiety  that failures and rejections hurt more and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected   the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self esteem  not  join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain  treat yourself with the same compassion  you would expect from a truly good friend. We have to catch our unhealthy  psychological habits and change them. One of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you  or your  professor makes you feel stupid in class  or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying the scene in your head for days  sometimes for weeks on end. Ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit  and it's a very costly one. Because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts  you are actually putting yourself at significant risk for developing clinical depression   alcoholism  eating disorders  and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important  so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact   because a little over a year ago  I developed the habit myself. You see  my twin brother was diagnosed with stage III non Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremly aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking about  what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking about  how much he was suffering  even though he never complained  not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy   but psychologically I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying   upsetting  negative thought  I forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed. And within one week   my whole outlook changed and became more positive  and more hopeful. Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy  my brother had a CAT scan  and I was by his side when  he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds  of chemotherapy to go  but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely  by changing your responses to failure  by protecting your self esteem  by battling negative thinking  you won't just heal your psychological wounds  you will build emotional resilience  you will thrive. A hundred years ago   people began practicing personal hygiene  and life expectancy rates rose  by over    percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing  emotional hygiene. Can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier  If there were less loneliness  and less depression  If people knew how to overcome failure  If they felt better about themselves and more empowered  If they were happier and more fulfilled  I can  because that's the world I want to live in  and that's the world my brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed and change a few simple habits  well  that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much. In the mid '  s  the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of    of the leading causes of death in the United States. In high doses  it affects brain development  the immune system  hormonal systems  and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a    year difference in life expectancy. And yet  doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment. Now  the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical. It's childhood trauma. Okay. What kind of trauma am I talking about here  I'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game. I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology  things like abuse or neglect  or growing up with a parent  who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence. Now  for a long time  I viewed these things in the way  I was trained to view them  either as a social problem    refer to social services    or as a mental health problem    refer to mental health services. And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach. When I finished my residency  I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed  someplace where I could make a difference. So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center  one of the best private hospitals in Northern California  and together  we opened a clinic in Bayview Hunters Point  one of the poorest  most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco. Now  prior to that point  there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than        children  so we hung a shingle  and we were able to provide top quality care regardless of ability to pay. It was so cool. We targeted the typical health disparities  access to care  immunization rates  asthma hospitalization rates  and we hit all of our numbers. We felt very proud of ourselves. But then I started noticing a disturbing trend. A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD  or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  but when I actually did a thorough history and physical  what I found was that for most of my patients  I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD. Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on. Somehow I was missing something important. Now  before I did my residency  I did a master's degree in public health  and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see     kids that all drink from the same well  and    of them develop diarrhea  you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics  or you can walk over and say   What the hell is in this well   So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. And then one day  my colleague walked into my office  and he said   Dr. Burke  have you seen this   In his hand was a copy of a research study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study. That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about. It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC  and together  they asked        adults about their history of exposure to what they called  adverse  childhood experiences   or ACEs. Those include physical  emotional  or sexual abuse  physical or emotional neglect  parental mental illness  substance dependence  incarceration  parental separation or divorce  or domestic violence. For every yes  you would get a point on your ACE score. And then what they did was they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes. What they found was striking. Two things  Number one  ACEs are incredibly common. Sixty seven percent of the population had at least one ACE  and   .  percent  one in eight  had four or more ACEs. The second thing that they found was that there was a dose response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes  the higher your ACE score  the worse your health outcomes. For a person with an ACE score of four or more  their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero. For hepatitis  it was also two and a half times. For depression  it was four and a half times. For suicidality  it was    times. A person with an ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease  the number one killer in the United States of America. Well  of course this makes sense. Some people looked at this data and they said   Come on. You have a rough childhood  you're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health. This isn't science. This is just bad behavior.  It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in. We now understand better than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children. It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens  the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence. It inhibits the prefrontal cortex  which is necessary for impulse control and executive function  a critical area for learning. And on MRI scans  we see measurable differences in the amygdala  the brain's fear response center. So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high risk behavior  and that's important to know. But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high risk behavior  you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer. The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis  the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight or flight response. How does it work  Well  imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear. Immediately  your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary  which sends a signal  to your adrenal gland that says   Release stress hormones  Adrenaline  Cortisol   And so your heart starts to pound  Your pupils dilate  your airways open up  and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear. And that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear. But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night  and this system is activated over and over and over again  and it goes from being adaptive  or life saving  to maladaptive  or health damaging. Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation  because their brains and bodies are just developing. High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function  they affect the developing immune system  developing hormonal systems  and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed. So for me  this information threw my old training out the window  because when we understand the mechanism of a disease  when we know not only which pathways are disrupted  but how  then as doctors  it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment. That's what we do. So in San Francisco  we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent  screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress. We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical  because I know that if my patient  has an ACE score of    she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD  she's four and half times as likely to become depressed  and she's    times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs. I know that when she's in my exam room. For our patients who do screen positive  we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices  including home visits  care coordination  mental health care  nutrition  holistic interventions  and yes  medication when necessary. But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets  or lead poisoning  and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment  given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems. So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops  because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview. I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this  it would be routine screening  multi disciplinary treatment teams  and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols. Yeah. That did not happen. And that was a huge learning for me. What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement. In the words of Dr. Robert Block  the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics   Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.  And for a lot of people  that's a terrifying prospect. The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it. But for me  that's actually where the hopes lies  because when we have the right framework  when we recognize this to be a public health crisis  then we can begin to use the right  tool kit to come up with solutions. From tobacco to lead poisoning  to HIV AIDS  the United States actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems  but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment  and when I look at what our nation's response has been so far  I wonder  why haven't we taken this more seriously  You know  at first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us. That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods. Which is weird  because the data doesn't bear that out. The original ACEs study was done in a population that was    percent Caucasian     percent college educated. But then  the more I talked to folks  I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards. If I were to ask how many people in this room grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness  I bet a few hands would go up. And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much  or who really believed that if you spare the rod  you spoil the child  I bet a few more hands would go up. Even in this room  this is an issue that touches many of us  and I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us. Maybe it's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it. We'd rather be sick. Fortunately  scientific advances and  frankly  economic realities make that option less viable every day. The science is clear  Early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime. Today  we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death  and    years from now  the child who has a high ACE score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized  whose asthma management is not connected  and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a six month mortality from HIV AIDS. People will look at that situation and say   What the heck happened there   This is treatable. This is beatable. The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say  this is real and this is all of us. I believe that we are the movement. Thank you. As an Arab female photographer  I have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences. The passion I developed for knowledge  which allowed me to break barriers towards a better life was the motivation  for my project I Read I Write. Pushed by my own experience  as I was not allowed initially to pursue my higher education  I decided to explore and document stories of other women who changed their lives through education  while exposing and questioning the barriers they face. I covered a range of topics that concern women's education  keeping in mind the differences among Arab countries due to economic and social factors. These issues include female illiteracy  which is quite high in the region  educational reforms  programs for dropout students  and political activism among university students. As I started this work  it was not always easy  to convince the women to participate. Only after explaining to them how their stories might influence other women's lives  how they would become role models for their own community  did some agree. Seeking a collaborative and reflexive approach  I asked them to write their own words and ideas on prints of their own images. Those images were then shared in some of the classrooms  and worked to inspire and motivate other women going through similar educations  and situations. Aisha  a teacher from Yemen  wrote   I sought education in order to be independent and to not count on men with everything.  One of my first subjects was Umm El Saad from Egypt. When we first met  she was barely able to write her name. She was attending a nine month literacy program run by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs. Months later  she was joking that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes  as he found out that his now literate wife was going through his phone text messages. Naughty Umm El Saad. Of course  that's not why Umm El Saad joined the program. I saw how she was longing to gain control over her simple daily routines  small details that we take for granted  from counting money at the market to helping her kids in homework. Despite her poverty and her community's mindset  which belittles women's education  Umm El Saad  along with her Egyptian classmates  was eager to learn how to read and write. In Tunisia  I met Asma  one of the four activist women I interviewed. The secular bioengineering student is quite active on social media. Regarding her country  which treasured what has been called the Arab Spring  she said   I've always dreamt of discovering a new bacteria. Now  after the revolution  we have a new one every single day.  Asma was referring to the rise of religious fundamentalism in the region  which is another obstacle to women in particular. Out of all the women I met  Fayza from Yemen affected me the most. Fayza was forced to drop out of school at the age of eight when she was married. That marriage lasted for a year. At     she became the third wife of a    year old man  and by the time she was     she was a divorced mother of three. Despite her poverty  despite her social status as a divorc e in an ultra conservative society  and despite the opposition of her parents to her going back to school  Fayza knew that her only way to control her life was through education. She is now   . She received a grant from a local NGO to fund her business studies at the university. Her goal is to find a job  rent a place to live in  and bring her kids back with her. The Arab states are going through tremendous change  and the struggles women face are overwhelming. Just like the women I photographed  I had to overcome many barriers to becoming the photographer I am today  many people along the way telling me what I can and cannot do. Umm El Saad  Asma and Fayza  and many women across the Arab world  show that it is possible to overcome barriers to education  which they know is the best means to a better future. And here I would like to end with a quote by Yasmine  one of the four activist women I interviewed in Tunisia. Yasmine wrote   Question your convictions. Be who you to want to be  not who they want you to be. Don't accept their enslavement  for your mother birthed you free.  Thank you. I am multidisciplinary. As a scientist  I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year  and as an artist  I create multicultural community art all over the planet. And recently  I've actually been combining both. But let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission. This is the HI SEAS program. HI SEAS is a NASA funded planetary surface analogue on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii  and it's a research program that is specifically designed to study the effects of long term isolation of small crews. I lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six  a very interesting experience  of course. We did all kinds of research. Our main research was actually a food study  but apart from that food study    developing a new food system for astronauts living in deep space    we also did all kinds of other research. We did extra vehicular activities  as you can see here  wearing mock up space suits  but we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do  like questionnaires at the end of every day. Busy  busy work. Now  as you can imagine  it's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people in a small space for a long time. There's all kinds of psychological challenges  how to keep a team together in these circumstances  how to deal with the warping of time you start to sense when you're living in these circumstances  sleep problems that arise  etc. But also we learned a lot. I learned a lot about how individual crew members actually cope with a situation like this  how you can keep a crew productive and happy  for example  giving them a good deal of autonomy is a good trick to do that  and honestly  I learned a lot about leadership  because I was a crew commander. So doing this mission  I really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space. We will venture into outer space  and we will start inhabiting outer space. I have no doubt about it. It might take    years or it might take     years  but it's going to happen nevertheless. So I came up with a new art project called Seeker. And the Seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world to come up with starship prototypes that re envision human habitation and survival. That's the core of the project. Now  one important thing  This is not a dystopian project. This is not about   Oh my God  the world is going wrong and we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else.  No  no. The project is basically inviting people to take a step away from earthbound constraints and  as such  reimagine our future. And it's really helpful  and it works really well  so that's really the important part of what we're doing. Now  in this project  I'm using a cocreation approach  which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many artists. I'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group  into a community  people start gravitating to the idea  and together  we shape  and build the artwork. It's a little bit like termites  really. We just work together  and even  for example  when architects visit what we're doing  sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding how we build without a master plan. We always come up with these fantastic large scale scupltures that actually we can also inhabit. The first version was done in Belgium and Holland. It was built with a team of almost    people. This is the second iteration of that same project  but in Slovenia  in a different country  and the new group was like  we're going  to do the architecture differently. So they took away the architecture  they kept the base of the artwork  and they built an entirely new  much more biomorphic architecture on top of that. And that's another crucial part of the project. It's an evolving artwork  evolving architecture. This was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in Holland  which was using caravans  as modules to build a starship. We bought some second hand caravans  cut them open  and reassembled them into a starship. Now  when we're thinking about starships  we're not just approaching it as a technological challenge. We're really looking at it as a combination of three systems  ecology  people and technology. So there's always a strong ecological component in the project. Here you can see aquaponic systems that are actually surrounding the astronauts  so they're constantly in contact with part of the food that they're eating. Now  a very typical thing for this project is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects. We actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end  and test what we build. And this is  for example  on the right hand side you can see an isolation mission in the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana in Slovenia  where six artists and designers locked themselves up    I was part of that    for four days inside the museum. And  of course  obviously  this is a very performative and very strong experience for all of us. Now  the next version of the project is currently being developed together with Camilo Rodriguez Beltran  who is also a TED Fellow  in the Atacama Desert in Chile  a magical place. First of all  it's really considered a Mars analogue. It really does look like Mars in certain locations and has been used by NASA to test equipment. And it has a long history of being connected to space through observations of the stars. It's now home to ALMA  the large telescope that's being developed there. But also  it's the driest location on the planet  and that makes it extremely interesting to build our project  because suddenly  sustainability is something we have to explore fully. We have no other option  so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen. Now  a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that I'm very interested to see how we can connect with the local population  the native population. These people have been living there for a very long time and can be considered experts in sustainability  and so I'm very interested to see what we can learn from them  and have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration. So we're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space by exploring integration  biology  technology and people  by using a cocreation approach  and by using and exploring local traditions and to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future. Thank you. An    year old  African American male joined the United States Air Force and was assigned to Mountain Home  Air Force Base and was a part of the air police squadron. Upon first arriving there  the first goal that I had was for me to identify an apartment  so I could bring my wife  and my new baby  Melanie  out to join me in Idaho. I immediately went to  the personnel office  and talking with the guys in personnel  they said   Hey  no problem finding  an apartment in Mountain Home  Idaho. The people down there love us  because they know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent  one of their apartments  they'll always get their money.  And that was a really important thing. He said   So here is a list  of people that you can call  and then they will then allow you  to select the apartment that you want.  So I got the list  I made the call. The lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted. She said   Oh  great you called. We have four or five apartments available right now.  She said   Do you want  a one bedroom or two bedroom   Then she said   Let's not talk about that. Just come on down   select the apartment that you want. We'll sign the contract and you'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away.  So I was excited. I jumped in my car. I went downtown and knocked on the door. When I knocked on the door   the woman came to the door  and she looked at me  and she said   Can I help you   I said   Yes  I'm the person  who called about the apartments. I was just coming down  to make my selection.  She said   You know what   I'm really sorry  but my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them.  I said   You mean he rented  all five of them in one hour   She didn't give me a response  and what she said was this  She said   Why don't you leave your number  and if we have some openings   I'll give you a call   Needless to say  I did not get a call from her. Nor did I get any responses  from the other people that they gave me on the list where I could get apartments. So as a result of that  and feeling rejected  I went back to the base  and I talked to the squadron commander. His name was McDow  Major McDow. I said   Major McDow  I need your help.  I told him what happened   and here's what he said to me  He said   James  I would love to help you. But you know the problem  We can't make people rent to folks  that they don't want to rent to. And besides  we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don't want to damage that.  He said   So maybe this is  what you should do. Why don't you let your family stay home  because you do know  that you get a    day leave. So once a year  you can go home to your family  spend    days and then come on back.  Needless to say  that didn't resonate for me. So after leaving him   I went back to personnel  and talking to the clerk  he said   Jim  I think I have a  solution for you. There's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer. If you noticed  in Mountain Home  there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place. You can buy his trailer  and you'd probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town as soon as possible. And that would take care of your problem  and that would provide  the solution for you.  So I immediately jumped in my car  went downtown  saw the trailer    it was a small trailer  but under the circumstances  I figured that was the  best thing that I could do. So I bought the trailer. And then I asked him    Can I just leave the trailer here  and that would take care  of all my problems  I wouldn't have to find another trailer park   He said   Before I say yes to that   I need to check with management.  So I get back to the base  he called me back and management said   No  you can't leave the trailer here because we had promised that slot to some other people.  And that was strange to me because there were several  other slots that were open  but it just so happened that he  had promised that slot to someone else. So  what I did    and he said   You shouldn't worry  Jim  because there are a lot of trailer parks.  So I put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks. I went to one after another   after another. And I got the same kind of rejection there that I received when I was looking  for the apartment. And as a result  the kind of comments that they made to me  in addition to saying that they didn't have any slots open  one person said   Jim  the reason why we can't rent to you  we already have a Negro family in the trailer park.  He said   And it's not me   because I like you people.  And that's what I did  too. I chuckled  too. He said   But here's the problem  If I let you in  the other tenants  will move out and I can't afford to take that kind of a hit.  He said   I just can't rent to you.  Even though that was discouraging  it didn't stop me. I kept looking  and I looked at the far end  of the town in Mountain Home  and there was a small trailer park. I mean  a really small trailer park. It didn't have any paved roads in it  it didn't have the concrete slabs  it didn't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot  from other trailer slots. It didn't have a laundry facility. But the conclusion I reached  at that moment was that I didn't have  a lot of other options. So I called my wife  and I said   We're going to make this one work.  And we moved into it and we became homeowners in Mountain Home  Idaho. And of course  eventually things settled down. Four years after that  I received papers to move from Mountain Home  Idaho to a place called Goose Bay  Labrador. We won't even talk about that. It was another great location.  Laughter  So my challenge then was to get my family  from Mountain Home  Idaho to Sharon  Pennsylvania. That wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand new automobile. My mother called  and said she'll fly out. She'll be with us as we drive  she'll help us manage the children. So she came out  her and Alice  put a lot of food together for the trip. That morning  we left at about   a.m. Great trip  having a great time   good conversation. Somewhere around         o'clock  we got a little bit tired  and we said   Why don't we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early start in the morning   So we were looking at a number  of the motels as we drove down the road  and we saw one  it was a great big  bright flashing light that said   Vacancies  Vacancies  Vacanies.  So we stopped in. They were in the parking lot   I went inside. When I walked inside  the lady was just finishing up  one contract with some folks  some other people  were coming in behind me. And so I walked to the counter  and she said   How can I help you   I said   I would like to get a motel  for the evening for my family.  She said   You know  I'm really sorry  I just rented the last one. We will not have any more  until the morning.  She said   But if you go down the road about an hour     minutes  there's another trailer park down there.  I said   Yeah  but you still have the  'Vacancies' light on  and it's flashing.  She said   Oh  I forgot.  And she reached over  and turned the light off. She looked at me and I looked at her. There were other people in the room. She kind of looked at them. No one said anything. So I just got the hint and I left  and went outside to the parking lot. And I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie  and I said   It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight.  And we did drive down the road  but just before we took off  and pulled out of the parking lot  guess what happened  The light came back on. And it said   Vacancies   Vacancies  Vacancies.  We were able to find a nice place. It wasn't our preference  but it was secure and it was clean. And so we had a great sleep that night. The piece that's important about that is that we had similar kinds of experiences from Idaho all the way through  to Pennsylvania  where we were rejected from hotels   motels and restaurants. But we made it to Pennsylvania. We got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids. I jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay  Labrador  which is another story  right  Here it is     years later  I now have nine grandchildren   two great grandchildren. Five of the grandchildren are boys. I have master's  Ph.D.  undergrad  one in medical school. I have a couple that are trending. They're almost there but not quite.  Laughter  I have one who has been  in college now for eight years. He doesn't have a degree yet   but he wants to be a comedian. So we're just trying to get him to stay in school. Because you never know  just because you're funny at home  does not make you a comedian  right  But the thing about it   they're all good kids    no drugs  no babies  in high school  no crime. So with that being the backdrop  I was sitting in my TV room watching TV  and they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on. And all of a sudden  one of the news  commentators got on the air and she said   In the last three months  eight unarmed African American males have been killed by police  white homeowners  or white citizens.  For some reason  at that moment it just all hit me. I said   What is it  It is so insane. What is the hatred that's causing people  to do these kinds of things   Just then  one of my grandsons called. He said   Granddad  did you hear what they said on TV   I said   Yes  I did.  He said   I'm just so confused. We do everything we do  but it seems that driving while black  walking while black  talking while black  it's just dangerous. What can we do  We do everything that you told us to do. When stopped by the police  we place both hands on the steering wheel at the    o'clock position. If asked to get identification  we tell them  'I am slowly reaching over  into the glove compartment to get my I.D.' When pulled out of the car to be searched  when laid on the ground to be searched  when our trunks are opened to be searched  we don't push back  we don't challenge because we know  you've told us  'Don't you challenge the police. After it's over  call us and we'll be the ones to challenge.  He said   And this is the piece  that really bugs me  Our white friends  our buddies  we kind of hang together. When they hear about these kinds of things happening to us  they say  'Why do you take it  You need to push back. You need to challenge. You need to ask them  for their identification.'  And here's what the boys have been taught to tell them   We know that you can do that  but please do not do that while we're in the car because the consequences for you are significantly different than the consequences for us.  And so as a grandparent   what do I tell my grandsons  How do I keep them safe  How do I keep them alive  As a result of this  people have come to me and said   Jim  are you angry   And my response to that is this   I don't have the luxury of being angry  and I also know the consequences  of being enraged.  So therefore  the only thing that I can do is take my collective intellect and my energy and my ideas and my experiences and dedicate myself to challenge   at any point in time  anything that looks  like it might be racist. So the first thing I have  to do is to educate  the second thing I have to do  is to unveil racism  and the last thing I need to do is do everything within my power to eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary. The second thing I do is this  I want to appeal to Americans. I want to appeal to their humanity  to their dignity  to their civic pride and ownership to be able to not react to these  heinous crimes in an adverse manner. But instead  to elevate your level of societal knowledge  your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness to then collectively come together  all of us come together  to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity  any kind of insanity that makes it  okay to kill unarmed people  regardless of their ethnicity  regardless of their race  regardless of their diversity makeup. We have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense. The only way I think we can do that is through a collective. We need to have black and white  and Asian and Hispanic just to step forward and say   We are not going to accept  that kind of behavior anymore.  We humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies  but we haven't always been that good at figuring out what's important. Take the ancient Egyptians  for example  very concerned about the body parts they thought they'd need in the afterlife  but they left some parts out. This part  for example. Although they very carefully  preserved the stomach  the lungs  the liver  and so forth  they just mushed up the brain  drained it out through the nose  and threw it away  which makes sense  really  because what does a brain do for us anyway  But imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies that weighed just as much as the brain and in some ways was just as important to who we are  but we knew so little about and treated with such disregard. And imagine if  through new scientific advances  we were just beginning to understand its importance to how we think of ourselves. Wouldn't you want to know more about it  Well  it turns out that we do have something just like that  our gut  or rather  its microbes. But it's not just the microbes in our gut that are important. Microbes all over our body turn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences that make different people who we are. So for example  have you ever noticed how some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others  It turns out that everyone's anecdotal experience out camping is actually true. For example  I seldom get bitten by mosquitos  but my partner Amanda attracts them in droves  and the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin that produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect. Now  microbes are also really important in the field of medicine. So  for example  what microbes you have in your gut determine whether particular painkillers are toxic to your liver. They also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition. And  if you're a fruit fly  at least  your microbes determine who you want to have sex with. We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out.  Laughter  So microbes are performing a huge range of functions. They help us digest our food. They help educate our immune system. They help us resist disease  and they may even be affecting our behavior. So what would a map of all these microbial communities look like  Well  it wouldn't look exactly like this  but it's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity. Different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms that are immediately characteristic of one place or another or another. With microbiology  it's kind of the same  although I've got to be honest with you  All the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope. So instead of trying to identify them visually  what we do is we look at their DNA sequences  and in a project called the Human Microbiome Project  NIH funded this      million project where hundreds  of researchers came together to map out all the A's  T's  G's  and C's  and all of these microbes in the human body. So when we take them together  they look like this. It's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now  isn't it  What my lab does is develop computational techniques that allow us to take all these terabytes of sequence data and turn them into something that's a bit more useful as a map  and so when we do that with the human microbiome data from     healthy volunteers  it looks like this. Each point here represents all the complex microbes in an entire microbial community. See  I told you they basically all look the same. So what we're looking at is each point represents one microbial community from one body site of one healthy volunteer. And so you can see that there's different parts of the map in different colors  almost like separate continents. And what it turns out to be is that those  as the different regions of the body  have very different microbes in them. So what we have is we have the oral community up there in green. Over on the other side  we have the skin community in blue  the vaginal community in purple  and then right down at the bottom  we have the fecal community in brown. And we've just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another. So if I look at just one person's microbes in the mouth and in the gut  it turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities is enormous. It's bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef and the microbes in this prairie. So this is incredible when you think about it. What it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body makes more of a difference to your microbial ecology than hundreds of miles on Earth. And this is not to say that two people  look basically the same in the same body habitat  either. So you probably heard that we're pretty much all the same in terms of our human DNA. You're   .   percent identical in terms of your human DNA to the person sitting next to you. But that's not true of your gut microbes  you might only share    percent similarity with the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes. So that's as different as the bacteria on this prairie and the bacteria in this forest. So these different microbes have all these different kinds  of functions that I told you about  everything from digesting food to involvement in different kinds of diseases  metabolizing drugs  and so forth. So how do they do all this stuff  Well  in part it's because although there's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut  they really outnumber us. And so how much do they outnumber us  Well  it depends on what you think of as our bodies. Is it our cells  Well  each of us consists of about    trillion human cells  but we harbor as many as     trillion microbial cells. So they outnumber us    to one. Now  you might think  well  we're human because of our DNA  but it turns out that each of us has about        human genes  depending on what you count exactly  but as many as two million to    million microbial genes. So whichever way we look at it  we're vastly outnumbered by our microbial symbionts. And it turns out that in addition  to traces of our human DNA  we also leave traces of our microbial DNA on everything we touch. We showed in a study a few years ago that you can actually match the palm of someone's hand up to the computer mouse that they use routinely with up to    percent accuracy. So this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago  but more importantly  it was featured on  CSI  Miami   so you really know it's true. So where do our microbes come from in the first place  Well if  as I do  you have dogs or kids  you probably have some dark suspicions about that  all of which are true  by the way. So just like we can match you to your computer equipment by the microbes you share  we can also match you up to your dog. But it turns out that in adults  microbial communities are relatively stable  so even if you live together with someone  you'll maintain your separate microbial identity over a period of weeks  months  even years. It turns out that our first microbial communities depend a lot on how we're born. So babies that come out the regular way  all of their microbes are basically like the vaginal community  whereas babies that are delivered by C section  all of their microbes instead look like skin. And this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with Cesarean birth  such as more asthma  more allergies  even more obesity  all of which have been linked to microbes now  and when you think about it  until recently  every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal  and so the lack of those protective microbes that we've co evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome. When my own daughter was born a couple of years ago by emergency C section  we took matters into our own hands and made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes that she would have gotten naturally. Now  it's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect on her health specifically  right  With a sample size of just one child  no matter how much we love her  you don't really have enough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average  but at two years old  she hasn't had an ear infection yet  so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one. And what's more  we're starting to do clinical trials with more children to figure out whether this has a protective effect generally. So how we're born has a tremendous effect on what microbes we have initially  but where do we go after that  What I'm showing you again here is this map of the Human Microbiome Project Data  so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of     healthy adults. And you've seen children develop physically. You've seen them develop mentally. Now  for the first time  you're going to see one of my colleague's children develop microbially. So what we are going to look at is we're going to look  at this one baby's stool  the fecal community  which represents the gut  sampled every week for almost two and a half years. And so we're starting on day one. What's going to happen is that the infant is going to start off as this yellow dot  and you can see that he's starting off basically in the vaginal community  as we would expect from his delivery mode. And what's going to happen over these two and a half years is that he's going to travel  all the way down to resemble the adult fecal community from healthy volunteers down at the bottom. So I'm just going to start this going and we'll see how that happens. What you can see  and remember each step in this is just one week  what you can see is that week to week  the change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child  the differences week to week are much greater than the differences between individual healthy adults in the Human Microbiome Project cohort  which are those brown dots down at the bottom. And you can see he's starting to approach the adult fecal community. This is up to about two years. But something amazing is about to happen here. So he's getting antibiotics for an ear infection. What you can see is this huge change in the community  followed by a relatively rapid recovery. I'll just rewind that for you. And what we can see is that just over these few weeks  we have a much more radical change  a setback of many months  of normal development  followed by a relatively rapid recovery  and by the time he reaches day      which is the end of this video  you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community  despite that antibiotic intervention. So this is really interesting because it raises fundamental questions about what happens when we intervene at different ages in a child's life. So does what we do early on  where the microbiome is changing so rapidly  actually matter  or is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea  where the ripples will just be lost  Well  fascinatingly  it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life  they're more likely to become obese later on than if they don't get antibiotics then or only get them later  and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we're only beginning to understand. So this is fascinating  because one day  in addition to the effects that antibiotics have on antibiotic resistant bacteria  which are very important  they may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems  and so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same horror that we currently reserve for those metal tools that the Egyptians used to use to mush up the brains before they drained them out for embalming. So I mentioned that microbes have all these important functions  and they've also now  just over the past few years  been connected to a whole range of different diseases  including inflammatory bowel disease  heart disease  colon cancer  and even obesity. Obesity has a really  large effect  as it turns out  and today  we can tell whether you're lean or obese with    percent accuracy by looking at the microbes in your gut. Now  although that might sound impressive  in some ways it's a little bit problematic as a medical test  because you can probably tell which of these people is obese without knowing anything about their gut microbes  but it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes and had all their human DNA  we could only predict which one was obese with about    percent accuracy. So that's amazing  right  What it means that the three pounds of microbes that you carry around with you may be more important for some health conditions than every single gene in your genome. And then in mice  we can do a lot more. So in mice  microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions  including things like multiple sclerosis  depression  autism  and again  obesity. But how can we tell whether these microbial differences that correlate with disease are cause or effect  Well  one thing we can do is we can raise some mice without any microbes of their own in a germ free bubble. Then we can add in some microbes that we think are important  and see what happens. When we take the microbes from an obese mouse and transplant them into a genetically normal mouse that's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own  it becomes fatter than if it got them  from a regular mouse. Why this happens is absolutely amazing  though. Sometimes what's going on is that the microbes are helping them digest food more efficiently from the same diet  so they're taking more energy from their food  but other times  the microbes are actually affecting their behavior. What they're doing is they're eating more than the normal mouse  so they only get fat if we let them  eat as much as they want. So this is really remarkable  right  The implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior. So you might be wondering whether we can  also do this sort of thing across species  and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and transplant them into mice you've raised germ free  those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person  but we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight. We can also do this for malnutrition. So in a project funded by the Gates Foundation  what we're looking at is children in Malawi who have kwashiorkor  a profound form of malnutrition  and mice that get the kwashiorkor community transplanted into them lose    percent of their body mass in just three weeks  but we can restore their health by using  the same peanut butter based supplement that is used for  the children in the clinic  and the mice that receive the community from the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine. This is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice with individual people's gut communities and perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the individual level. So I think it's really important that everyone has a chance to participate in this discovery. So  a couple of years ago  we started this project called American Gut  which allows you to claim a place  for yourself on this microbial map. This is now the largest crowd funded science project that we know of    over       people have signed up at this point. What happens is  they send in their samples  we sequence the DNA of their microbes and then release the results back to them. We also release them  de identified  to scientists  to educators  to interested members of the general public  and so forth  so anyone can have access to the data. On the other hand  when we do tours of our lab at the BioFrontiers Institute  and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop  it turns out that not everyone wants to know. But I'm guessing that many of you do  and so I brought some kits here if you're interested in trying this out for yourself. So why might we want to do this  Well  it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out where we are in terms of our health  but they can actually cure disease. This is one of the newest things we've been able to visualize with colleagues  at the University of Minnesota. So here's that map of the human microbiome again. What we're looking at now    I'm going to add in the community of some people with C. diff. So  this is a terrible form of diarrhea where you have to go up to    times a day  and these people have failed antibiotic therapy for two years before they're eligible for this trial. So what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool from a healthy donor  that star down at the bottom  into these patients. Would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health  So let's watch exactly what happens there. Four of those patients are about to get a transplant from that healthy donor at the bottom  and what you can see is that immediately  you have this radical change in the gut community. So one day after you do that transplant  all those symptoms clear up  the diarrhea vanishes  and they're essentially healthy again  coming to resemble the donor's community  and they stay there. So we're just at the beginning of this discovery. We're just finding out that microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases  ranging from inflammatory  bowel disease to obesity  and perhaps even autism and depression. What we need to do  though  is we need to develop a kind of microbial GPS  where we don't just know where we are currently but also where we want to go and what we need to do in order to get there  and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it.  Laughter  Thank you. While preparing for my talk I was reflecting on my life and trying to figure out where exactly was that moment when my journey began. A long time passed by  and I simply couldn't figure out the beginning or the middle or the end of my story. I always used to think that my beginning was one afternoon in my community when my mother had told me that I had escaped three arranged marriages by the time I was two. Or one evening when electricity had failed for eight hours in our community  and my dad sat  surrounded by all of us  telling us stories of when he was a little kid struggling to go to school while his father  who was a farmer  wanted him to work in the fields with him. Or that dark night when I was    when three little kids had come to me and they whispered in my ear that my friend was murdered in something called the honor killings. But then I realized that  as much as I know that these moments have contributed on my journey  they have influenced my journey but they have not been the beginning of it  but the true beginning of my journey was in front of a mud house in upper Sindh of Pakistan  where my father held the hand of my    year old mother and they decided to walk out of the village to go to a town where they could send their kids to school. In a way  I feel like my life is kind of a result of some wise choices and decisions they've made. And just like that  another of their decisions was to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots. While we were living in a community I fondly remember as called Ribabad  which means community of the poor  my dad made sure that we also had a house in our rural homeland. I come from an indigenous tribe in the mountains of Balochistan called Brahui. Brahui  or Brohi  means mountain dweller  and it is also my language. Thanks to my father's very strict rules about connecting to our customs  I had to live a beautiful life of songs   cultures  traditions  stories  mountains  and a lot of sheep. But then  living in two extremes between the traditions  of my culture  of my village  and then modern education in my school wasn't easy. I was aware that I was the only girl who got to have such freedom  and I was guilty of it. While going to school in Karachi and Hyderabad  a lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off  some to older men  some in exchange  some even as second wives. I got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me when I saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness  when women were told to have patience as their main virtue. Up until I was     I healed my sadness by crying  mostly at nights  when everyone would sleep and I would sob in my pillow  until that one night  when I found out my friend was killed in the name of honor. Honor killings is a custom where men and women are suspected of having relationships before or outside of the marriage  and they're killed by their family for it. Usually the killer is the brother or father or the uncle in the family. The U.N. reports there are about       honor murders every year in Pakistan  and these are only the reported cases. A custom that kills did not make any sense to me  and I knew I had to do something about it this time. I was not going to cry myself to sleep. I was going to do something  anything  to stop it. I was       I started writing poetry and going door to door telling everybody about honor killings and why it happens  why it should be stopped  and raising awareness about it until I actually found a much  much  better way to handle this issue. In those days  we were living in a very small  one roomed house in Karachi. Every year  during the monsoon seasons  our house would flood up with water    rainwater and sewage    and my mom and dad would be taking the water out. In those days  my dad brought home a huge machine  a computer. It was so big it looked as if it was going to take up half of the only room we had  and had so many pieces and wires that needed to be connected. But it was still the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me and my sisters. My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge of taking care of the computer  and all of us were given    to    minutes every day to use it. Being the oldest of eight kids  I got to use it the last  and that was after I had washed the dishes  cleaned the house  made dinner with my mom  and put blankets on the floor for everyone to sleep  and after that   I would run to the computer  connect it to the Internet  and have pure joy and wonder for    to    minutes. In those days  I had discovered a website called Joogle.  Google   Laughter  In my frantic wish to do something about this custom  I made use of Google and discovered Facebook  a website where people can connect to anyone around the world  and so  from my very tiny  cement roofed room in Karachi  I connected with people in the U.K.  the U.S.  Australia and Canada  and created a campaign called WAKE UP Campaign against Honor Killings. It became enormous in just a few months. I got a lot of support from all around the world. Media was connecting to us. A lot of people were reaching out trying to raise awareness with us. It became so big that it went from online to the streets of my hometown  where we would do rallies and strikes trying to change the policies  in Pakistan for women's support. And while I thought everything was perfect  my team    which was basically my friends and neighbors at that time    thought everything was going so well  we had no idea a big opposition was coming to us. My community stood up against us  saying we were spreading un Islamic behavior. We were challenging centuries old customs in those communities. I remember my father receiving anonymous letters saying   Your daughter  is spreading Western culture in the honorable societies.  Our car was stoned at one point. One day I went to the office and found our metal signboard wrinkled and broken as if a lot of people had been hitting it with something heavy. Things got so bad that I had to hide myself in many ways. I would put up the windows of the car  veil my face  not speak while I was in public  but eventually situations got worse when my life was threatened  and I had to leave  back to Karachi  and our actions stopped. Back in Karachi  as an    year old  I thought this was the biggest failure of my entire life. I was devastated. As a teenager  I was blaming myself for everything that happened. And it turns out  when we started reflecting  we did realize that it was actually me and my team's fault. There were two big reasons why our campaign had failed big time. One of those  the first reason  is we were standing against core values of people. We were saying no to something that was very important to them  challenging their code of honor  and hurting them deeply in the process. And number two  which was very important for me to learn  and amazing  and surprising for me to learn  was that we were not including the true heroes who should be fighting for themselves. The women in the villages had no idea we were fighting for them in the streets. Every time I would go back  I would find my cousins and friends with scarves on their faces  and I would ask   What happened   And they'd be like    Our husbands beat us.  But we are working in the streets for you  We are changing the policies. How is that not impacting their life  So then we found out something which was very amazing for us. The policies of a country do not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities. It was devastating    like  oh  we can't actually do something about this  And we found out there's a huge gap when it comes to official policies and the real truth on the ground. So this time  we were like  we are going to do something different. We are going to use strategy  and we are going to go back and apologize. Yes  apologize. We went back to the communities and we said we are  very ashamed of what we did. We are here to apologize  and in fact  we are here to make it up to you. How do we do that  We are going to promote three of your main cultures. We know that it's music  language  and embroidery. Nobody believed us. Nobody wanted to work with us. It took a lot of convincing and discussions with these communities until they agreed that we are going to promote their language by making a booklet of their stories  fables and old tales in the tribe  and we would promote their music by making a CD of the songs from the tribe  and some drumbeating. And the third  which was my favorite  was we would promote their embroidery by making a center in the village where women would come every day to make embroidery. And so it began. We worked with one village  and we started our first center. It was a beautiful day. We started the center. Women were coming to make embroidery  and going through a life changing process of education  learning about their rights  what Islam says about their rights  and enterprise development  how they can create money  and then how they can create money from money  how they can fight the customs that have been destroying their lives from so many centuries  because in Islam  in reality  women are supposed to be shoulder to shoulder with men. Women have so much status that we have not been hearing  that they have not been hearing  and we needed to tell them that they need to know where their rights are and how to take them by themselves  because they can do it and we can't. So this was the model which actually came out    very amazing. Through embroidery we were promoting their traditions. We went into the village. We would mobilize the community. We would make a center inside where    women will come for six months to learn about value addition of traditional embroidery  enterprise development  life skills and basic education  and about their rights and how to say no to those customs and how to stand as leaders for themselves and the society. After six months  we would connect these women to loans and to markets where they can become local entrepreneurs in their communities. We soon called this project Sughar. Sughar is a local word used in many  many languages in Pakistan. It means skilled and confident women. I truly believe  to create women leaders  there's only one thing you have to do  Just let them know that they have what it takes to be a leader. These women you see here  they have strong skills and potential to be leaders. All we had to do was remove the barriers that surrounded them  and that's what we decided to do. But then while we were thinking everything was going well  once again everything was fantastic  we found our next setback  A lot of men started seeing the visible changes in their wife. She's speaking more  she's making decisions    oh my gosh  she's handling  everything in the house. They stopped them from coming to the centers  and this time  we were like  okay  time for strategy two. We went to the fashion  industry in Pakistan and decided to do research about what happens there. Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistan is very strong and growing day by day  but there is less contribution from the tribal areas and to the tribal areas  especially women. So we decided to launch our first ever tribal women's very own fashion brand  which is now called Nomads. And so women started earning more  they started contributing more financially to the house  and men had to think again before saying no to them when they were coming to the centers. Thank you  thank you. In       we launched our first Sughar Hub instead of a center. We partnered with TripAdvisor and created a cement hall in the middle of a village and invited so many other organizations to work over there. We created this platform for the nonprofits so they can touch and work on the other issues that Sughar is not working on  which would be an easy place  for them to give trainings  use it as a farmer school  even as a marketplace  and anything they want to use it for  and they have been doing really amazingly. And so far  we have been able to support     women in    villages around Pakistan. But that's actually not what I want. My dream is to reach out to one million women in the next    years  and to make sure that happens  this year we launched Sughar Foundation in the U.S. It is not just going to fund Sughar but many other organizations in Pakistan to replicate the idea and to find even more innovative ways to unleash the rural women's potential in Pakistan. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Khalida  you are quite the force of nature. I mean  this story  in many ways  just seems beyond belief. It's incredible that someone so young could do achieve this much through so much force and ingenuity. So I guess one question  This is a spectacular dream to reach out and empower a million women    how much of the current  success depends on you  the force of this magnetic personality  How does it scale  Khalida Brohi  I think my job is to give the inspiration out  give my dream out. I can't teach how to do it  because there are so many different ways. We have been experimenting with three ways only. There are a hundred different ways to unleash potential in women. I would just give the inspiration and that's my job. I will keep doing it. Sughar will still be growing. We are planning to reach out to two more villages  and soon I believe  we will be scaling out of Pakistan into South Asia and beyond. CA  I love that when you talked about your team in the talk  I mean  you were all    at the time. What did this team look like  This was school friends  right  KB  Do people here believe that I'm at an age where I'm supposed to be a grandmother in my village  My mom was married at nine  and I am the oldest woman not married and not doing anything in my life in my village. CA  Wait  wait  wait  not doing anything  KB  No. CA  You're right. KB  People feel sorry for me  a lot of times. CA  But how much time are you spending now actually back in Balochistan  KB  I live over there. We live between  still  Karachi and Balochistan. My siblings are all going to school. I am still the oldest of eight siblings. CA  But what you're doing is definitely threatening to some people there. How do you handle safety  Do you feel safe  Are there issues there  KB  This question has come to me a lot of times before  and I feel like the word  fear  just comes to me and then drops  but there is one fear that I have that is different from that. The fear is that if I get killed  what would happen to the people who love me so much  My mom waits for me till late at night that I should come home. My sisters want to learn so much from me  and there are many  many girls in my community who want to talk to me and ask me different things  and I recently got engaged.  Laughs  CA  Is he here  You've got to stand up. KB  Escaping arranged marriages  I chose my own husband across the world in L.A.  a really different world. I had to fight for a whole year. That's totally a different story. But I think that's the only thing that I'm afraid of  and I don't want my mom to not see anyone when she waits in the night. CA  So people who want to help you on their way  they can go on  they can maybe buy some of these clothes that you're bringing over that are actually made  the embroidery is done back in Balochistan  KB  Yeah. CA  Or they can get involved in the foundation. KB  Definitely. We are looking for as many people as we can  because now that the foundation's in the beginning process  I am trying to learn a lot about how to operate  how to get funding or reach out to more organizations  and especially in the e commerce  which is very new for me. I mean  I am not a fashion person  believe me. CA  Well  it's been incredible to have you here. Please go on being courageous  go on being smart  and please stay safe. KB  Thank you so much. CA  Thank you  Khalida.  Applause  One of the first patients I had to see as a pediatrician was Sol  a beautiful month old baby who was admitted with signs of a severe respiratory infection. Until then  I had never seen a patient worsen so fast. In just two days she was connected to a respirator and on the third day she died. Sol had whooping cough. After discussing the case in the room and after a quite distressing catharsis  I remember my chief resident said to me   Okay  take a deep breath. Wash your face. And now comes the hardest part  We have to go talk to her parents.  At that time  a thousand questions came to mind  from   How could a one month old baby be so unfortunate   to   Could we have done something about it   Before vaccines existed  many infectious diseases killed millions of people per year. During the      flu pandemic    million people died. That's greater than Argentina's current population. Perhaps  the older ones among you remember the polio epidemic that occurred in Argentina in     . At that time  there was no vaccine available against polio. People didn't know what to do. They were going crazy. They would go painting trees with caustic lime. They'd put little bags of camphor in their children's underwear  as if that could do something. During the polio epidemic  thousands of people died. And thousands of people were left with very significant neurological damage. I know this because I read about it  because thanks to vaccines  my generation was lucky to not live through an epidemic as terrible as this. Vaccines are one of the great successes of the   th century's public health. After potable water  they are the interventions that have most reduced mortality  even more than antibiotics. Vaccines eradicated terrible diseases such as smallpox from the planet and succeeded in significantly reducing mortality due to other diseases such as measles  whooping cough  polio and many more. All these diseases are considered vaccine preventable diseases. What does this mean  That they are potentially preventable  but in order to be so  something must be done. You need to get vaccinated. I imagine that most  if not all of us here today  received a vaccine at some point in our life. Now  I'm not so sure that many of us know which vaccines or boosters we should receive after adolescence. Have you ever wondered who we are protecting when we vaccinate  What do I mean by that  Is there any other effect beyond protecting ourselves  Let me show you something. Imagine for a moment that we are in a city that has never had a case of a particular disease  such as the measles. This would mean that no one in the city has ever had contact with the disease. No one has natural defenses against  nor been vaccinated against measles. If one day  a person sick with the measles appears in this city the disease won't find much resistance and will begin spreading from person to person  and in no time it will disseminate throughout the community. After a certain time a big part of the population will be ill. This happened when there were no vaccines. Now  imagine the complete opposite case. We are in a city where more than    percent of the population has defenses against the measles  which means that they either had the disease  survived  and developed natural defenses  or that they had been immunized against measles. If one day  a person sick with the measles appears in this city  the disease will find much more resistance and won't be transmitted that much from person to person. The spread will probably remain contained and a measles outbreak won't happen. I would like you to pay attention to something. People who are vaccinated are not only protecting themselves  but by blocking the dissemination of the disease within the community  they are indirectly protecting the people in this community who are not vaccinated. They create a kind of protective shield which prevents them from coming in contact with the disease  so that these people are protected. This indirect protection that the unvaccinated people within a community receive simply by being surrounded by vaccinated people  is called herd immunity. Many people in the community depend almost exclusively on this herd immunity to be protected against disease. The unvaccinated people you see in infographics are not just hypothetical. Those people are our nieces and nephews  our children  who may be too young to receive their first shots. They are our parents  our siblings  our acquaintances  who may have a disease  or take medication that lowers their defenses. There are also people who are allergic to a particular vaccine. They could even be among us  any of us who got vaccinated  but the vaccine didn't produce the expected effect  because not all vaccines are always     percent effective. All these people depend almost exclusively on herd immunity to be protected against diseases. To achieve this effect of herd immunity  it is necessary that a large percentage of the population be vaccinated. This percentage is called the threshold. The threshold depends on many variables  It depends on the germ's characteristics  and those of the immune response that the vaccine generates. But they all have something in common. If the percentage of the population in a vaccinated community is below this threshold number  the disease will begin to spread more freely and may generate an outbreak of this disease within the community. Even diseases which were  at some point controlled may reappear. This is not just a theory. This has happened  and is still happening. In       a British researcher published an article in one of the most important medical journals  saying that the MMR vaccine  which is given for measles  mumps and rubella  was associated with autism. This generated an immediate impact. People began to stop getting vaccinated  and stopped vaccinating their children. And what happened  The number of people vaccinated  in many communities around the world  fell below this threshold. And there were outbreaks of measles in many cities in the world    in the U.S.  in Europe. Many people got sick. People died of measles. What happened  This article also generated a huge stir within the medical community. Dozens of researchers began to assess if this was actually true. Not only could no one find a causal association between MMR and autism at the population level  but it was also found that this article had incorrect claims. Even more  it was fraudulent. It was fraudulent. In fact  the journal publicly retracted the article in     . One of the main concerns and excuses for not getting vaccinated are the adverse effects. Vaccines  like other drugs  can have potential adverse effects. Most are mild and temporary. But the benefits are always greater than possible complications. When we are ill  we want to heal fast. Many of us who are here take antibiotics when we have an infection  we take anti hypertensives when we have high blood pressure  we take cardiac medications. Why  Because we are sick and we want to heal fast. And we don't question it much. Why is it so difficult to think of preventing diseases  by taking care of ourselves when we are healthy  We take care of ourselves a lot when affected by an illness  or in situations of imminent danger. I imagine most of us here  remember the influenza A pandemic which broke out in      in Argentina and worldwide. When the first cases began to come to light  we  here in Argentina  were entering the winter season. We knew absolutely nothing. Everything was a mess. People wore masks on the street  ran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel. People would line up in pharmacies to get a vaccine  without even knowing if it was the right vaccine that would protect them against this new virus. We knew absolutely nothing. At that time  in addition to doing my fellowship at the Infant Foundation  I worked as a home pediatrician for a prepaid medicine company. I remember that I started my shift at   a.m.  and by    I already had a list of    scheduled visits. It was chaos  people didn't know what to do. I remember the types of patients that I was examining. The patients were a little older than what we were used to seeing in winter  with longer fevers. And I mentioned that to my fellowship mentor  and he  for his part  had heard the same from a colleague  about the large number of pregnant women and young adults being hospitalized in intensive care  with hard to manage clinical profiles. At that time  we set out to understand what was happening. First thing Monday morning  we took the car and went to a hospital in Buenos Aires Province  that served as a referral hospital for cases of the new influenza virus. We arrived at the hospital  it was crowded. All health staff were dressed in NASA like bio safety suits. We all had face masks in our pockets. I  being a hypochondriac  didn't breathe for two hours. But we could see what was happening. Immediately  we started reaching out to pediatricians from six hospitals in the city and in Buenos Aires Province. Our main goal was to find out how this new virus behaved in contact with our children  in the shortest time possible. A marathon work. In less than three months  we could see what effect this new H N  virus had on the     children hospitalized by this virus. We could see which children got more seriously ill  children under four  especially those less than one year old  patients with neurological diseases  and young children with chronic pulmonary diseases. Identifying these at risk groups was important to include them as priority groups in the recommendations for getting the influenza vaccine  not only here in Argentina  but also in other countries which the pandemic not yet reached. A year later  when a vaccine against the pandemic H N  virus became available  we wanted to see what happened. After a huge vaccination campaign aimed at protecting at risk groups  these hospitals  with    percent of the at risk groups vaccinated  had not hospitalized a single patient for the pandemic H N  virus. In          . In       zero. Vaccination is an act of individual responsibility  but it has a huge collective impact. If I get vaccinated  not only am I protecting myself  but I am also protecting others. Sol had whooping cough. Sol was very young  and she hadn't yet received her first vaccine against whooping cough. I still wonder what would have happened if everyone around Sol had been vaccinated. Six thousand miles of road      miles of subway track      miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track  if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island. These are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City. These are the statistics of our infrastructure. They're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies. For example  the Department of Transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain. The MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are. Most city agencies give us statistics. This is from a report this year from the Taxi and Limousine Commission  where we learn that there's about        taxis here in New York City. Pretty interesting  right  But did you ever think about where these numbers came from  Because for these numbers to exist  someone at the city agency had to stop and say  hmm  here's a number that somebody might want want to know. Here's a number  that our citizens want to know. So they go back to their raw data  they count  they add  they calculate  and then they put out reports  and those reports will have numbers like this. The problem is  how do they know all of our questions  We have lots of questions. In fact  in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city. The agencies can never keep up. So the paradigm isn't exactly working  and I think our policymakers realize that  because in       Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country. In a lot of ways  he's right. In the last two years   the city has released       datasets on our open data portal  and it's pretty awesome. So you go and look at data like this  and instead of just counting the number of cabs  we can start to ask different questions. So I had a question. When's rush hour in New York City  It can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly  And I thought to myself  these cabs aren't just numbers  these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take. There's data there  and I looked at that data  and I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day. You can see that from about midnight to around      in the morning  speed increases  and at that point  things turn around  and they get slower and slower and slower until about      in the morning  when they end up at around    and a half miles per hour. The average taxi is going    and a half miles per hour on our city streets  and it turns out it stays that way for the entire day. So I said to myself  I guess there's no rush hour in New York City. There's just a rush day. Makes sense. And this is important for a couple of reasons. If you're a transportation planner  this might be pretty interesting to know. But if you want to get somewhere quickly  you now know to set your alarm for      in the morning and you're all set. New York  right  But there's a story behind this data. This data wasn't just available  it turns out. It actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request  or a FOIL Request. This is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website. In order to access this data  you need to go get this form  fill it out  and they will notify you  and a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that. Chris went down  and they told him   Just bring a brand new hard drive  down to our office  leave it here for five hours  we'll copy the data and you take it back.  And that's where this data came from. Now  Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public  and so it ended up online for all to use  and that's where this graph came from. And the fact that it exists is amazing. These GPS recorders    really cool. But the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives picking up data from city agencies to make it public    it was already kind of public  you could get to it  but it was  public   it wasn't public. And we can do better than that as a city. We don't need our citizens walking around with hard drives. Now  not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request. Here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City based on cyclist accidents. So the red areas are more dangerous. And what it shows is first the East side of Manhattan  especially in the lower area of Manhattan  has more cyclist accidents. That might make sense because there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there. But there's other hotspots worth studying. There's Williamsburg. There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens. And this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero. This is exactly what we're looking for. But there's a story behind this data as well. This data didn't just appear. How many of you guys know this logo  Yeah  I see some shakes. Have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF and make sense of it  I see more shakes. More of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo. I like that. So what happened is  the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF. In fact  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of PDF put out by our very own NYPD  and in order to access it  you would either have to copy and paste for hundreds and hundreds of hours  or you could be John Krauss. John Krauss was like  I'm not going to copy and paste this data. I'm going to write a program. It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band Aid  and it goes to the NYPD's website and it would download PDFs. Every day it would search  if it found a PDF  it would download it and then it would run some PDF scraping program  and out would come the text  and it would go on the Internet  and then people could make maps like that. And the fact that the data's here  the fact that we have access to it    Every accident  by the way  is a row in this table. You can imagine how many PDFs that is. The fact that we have access to that is great  but let's not release it in PDF form  because then we're having our citizens write PDF scrapers. It's not the best use of our citizens' time  and we as a city can do better than that. Now  the good news is that the de Blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months ago  and so now we can actually have access to it  but there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF. For example  our crime data is still only available in PDF. And not just our crime data  our own city budget. Our city budget is only readable right now in PDF form. And it's not just us that can't analyze it    our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in PDF. So our legislators cannot analyze  the budget that they are voting for. And I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well. Now  there's a lot of data that's not hidden in PDFs. This is an example of a map I made  and this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City. Now  how do I measure dirty  Well  it's kind of a little weird  but I looked at the level of fecal coliform  which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways. The larger the circle  the dirtier the water  so the large circles are dirty water  the small circles are cleaner. What you see is inland waterways. This is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years. And inland waterways are  in general  dirtier. That makes sense  right  And the bigger circles are dirty. And I learned a few things from this. Number one  Never swim in anything that ends in  creek  or  canal.  But number two  I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City  by this measure  one measure. In Coney Island Creek  which is not the Coney Island you swim in  luckily. It's on the other side. But Coney Island Creek     percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high that it would be against state law to swim in the water. And this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see boasted in a city report  right  It's not going to be  the front page on nyc.gov. You're not going to see it there  but the fact that we can get  to that data is awesome. But once again  it wasn't super easy  because this data was not on the open data portal. If you were to go to the open data portal  you'd see just a snippet of it   a year or a few months. It was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website. And each one of these links is an Excel  sheet  and each Excel sheet is different. Every heading is different  you copy  paste  reorganize. When you do you can make maps and that's great  but once again  we can do better than that  as a city  we can normalize things. And we're getting there  because there's this website that Socrata makes called the Open Data Portal NYC. This is where       data sets  that don't suffer from the things I just told you live  and that number is growing  and that's great. You can download data in any format  be it CSV or PDF or Excel document. Whatever you want  you can download the data that way. The problem is  once you do  you will find that each agency codes their addresses differently. So one is street name   intersection street  street  borough  address  building  building address. So once again  you're spending time  even when we have this portal  you're spending time normalizing our address fields. And that's not the best use  of our citizens' time. We can do better than that as a city. We can standardize our addresses  and if we do   we can get more maps like this. This is a map of fire hydrants in New York City  but not just any fire hydrants. These are the top     grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets. So I learned a few things from this map  and I really like this map. Number one  just don't park on the Upper East Side. Just don't. It doesn't matter where you park  you will get a hydrant ticket. Number two  I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City  and they're on the Lower East Side  and they were bringing in over        dollars a year in parking tickets. And that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it  so I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant and then something called a curb extension  which is like a seven foot space to walk on  and then a parking spot. And so these cars came along  and the hydrant     It's all the way over there  I'm fine   and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them. They would park there  and the NYPD disagreed with this designation and would ticket them. And it wasn't just me  who found a parking ticket. This is the Google  Street View car driving by finding the same parking ticket. So I wrote about this on my blog  on I Quant NY  and the DOT responded  and they said   While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location  we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations.  And I thought to myself  typical government response  all right  moved on with my life. But then  a few weeks later  something incredible happened. They repainted the spot  and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data  because think about what happened here. For five years  this spot was being  ticketed  and it was confusing  and then a citizen found something  they told the city  and within a few weeks the problem was fixed. It's amazing. And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog. It's not  it's about being a partner. We can empower our citizens to be better partners for government  and it's not that hard. All we need are a few changes. If you're FOILing data  if you're seeing your data  being FOILed over and over again  let's release it to the public  that's a sign that it should be made public. And if you're a government agency releasing a PDF  let's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data  because that data is coming from somewhere. I don't know where  but it's coming from somewhere  and you can release it with the PDF. And let's adopt and share some open data standards. Let's start with our addresses here in New York City. Let's just start normalizing our addresses. Because New York is a leader in open data. Despite all this  we are absolutely a leader in open data  and if we start normalizing things  and set an open data standard  others will follow. The state will follow  and maybe the federal government  Other countries could follow  and we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program and map information from     countries. It's not science fiction. We're actually quite close. And by the way  who are we empowering with this  Because it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong. There are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now  active meetups. There are thousands of people attending these meetups. These people are going after work and on weekends  and they're attending these meetups to look at open data and make our city a better place. Groups like BetaNYC  who just last week  released something called citygram.nyc that allows you to subscribe to     complaints around your own home  or around your office. You put in your address  you get local complaints. And it's not just the tech community that are after these things. It's urban planners like  the students I teach at Pratt. It's policy advocates  it's everyone  it's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds. And with some small  incremental changes  we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens to harness open data and make our city even better  whether it's one dataset  or one parking spot at a time. Thank you. I'd like to start my performance by saying    percent of everything is crap. It's called Sturgeon's law  and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad. I have a giraffe here. I'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing. Sir  you caught the giraffe. I have a playing card in my hand. Freely name any card in the deck. Audience member     of hearts. Helder Guimar es     of hearts. You could have named any card in the deck  but you said the    of hearts. Ninety percent of everything is crap  so there's this to prove that Sturgeon was correct. Sir  this is not your show. Keep the giraffe for a moment  okay  Jesus. Crazy people. Well  the truth is  why is the majority of everything bad  And my answer is  I think we stop thinking too soon. I'll give you a clear little example  something that people used to do around the turn of the century    not this century  the other one. The idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand  in my case  the left hand. Something that would look like this. By the way you reacted  I can see your lack of interest. But that's okay  I understand why. We stop thinking too soon. But if we give it a little bit more thought  like a paper clip. A paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting. Not only that  if instead of using my hand with the fingers  I use my hand closed into a fist  that makes this even a little bit more interesting. Not only that  but I will impose myself a time limit of one second  something that would look like this. Now    no  no  no. Sturgeon may be correct. But he doesn't have to be correct forever. Things can always change. Sir  what was the card  The    of hearts  There's this to prove that things can always change    the    of hearts. Secrets are important. And secrets are valuable. And this is the best secret I've ever experienced. It starts with a deck of cards onto the table  an old man and a claim   I will not touch the deck till the end.  It doesn't matter who the man was  all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head   I will not touch the deck till the end.  Now  during all this time  he was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something. But I was not really paying attention to the book because I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before   I will not touch the deck till the end.  Now sir  you have the giraffe. Go ahead  throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random. Perfect. Sir  you're going to play my role in this story. The old man turned to me and he said   You could pick a red card or a black card.  My answer was ... Audience member    The black card. HG  Indeed  It was a black card. He said   It could be a club or a spade   and my answer was ... Audience member    Spade. HG  Indeed  It was a spade. He said   It could be a high spade or a low spade.  And my answer was ... Audience member    A high spade. HG  Indeed  It was a high spade. Since it's a high spade  it could be a nine  a     a jack  king  queen or the ace of spades. And my answer was ... Audience member    The king. HG  The king of spades  indeed. Now sir  let's be fair. You selected black  you selected spade  you selected the high spade  and you selected    sorry  Audience member    King. HG  King of spades. Did you feel I influenced you in any decision  Audience member    No  I just felt your energy. HG  But it was a free choice  correct  Because if not  we could start all over again. But it was really fair  Audience member    Absolutely. HG  Now  the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question  a number between one and   . And the first number I thought of was ... Audience member      . HG  Indeed  It was the   . The old man only said one more thing   This is the end.  And I knew exactly what that meant. I knew that he was going to touch the deck. Everything that you're about to see is exactly as it looked. He took the deck out of the box. Nothing in the box. He counted   One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine    .  The tension was building.                            .  And on the     instead of the king of spades  something appeared in the middle of the deck  that later  I would realize was actually a secret. The old man stood up  he left. I never saw him again. But he left his notebook that was there from the beginning. And when I picked it up  that was the best secret I've ever experienced. We are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share. And this was his way of sharing a secret with me. Crazy shit  Now    I believe that amazing things happen all the time. I really do. And the reason why we don't see them as often  it's because we don't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things. But what if we decided to search for those amazing things  for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing  So you have the giraffe  go ahead  throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random. Sir  I'm going to ask you  do you have  with you  a United States    bill  Audience member    I think so. HG  Yes  You see  a coincidence  Let's make sure you have it. Do you have it  Audience member    Yes. HG  Yes  Perfect. Now  I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do. I have a dollar bill here to explain. I want you to take the dollar bill  and fold the Washington part inside  like this. So you get this kind of big square  okay  Now  I want you to take the bill and fold it like this  lengthwise  so it becomes like a rectangle  and then again    really fold it  really crease it    and when you have it  please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it. Do you have it  Perfect. Now  I'm going to approach  and before we start  I want to make sure that we do this in very  very serious conditions. First of all  I want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip. First of all  take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill. And this is the reason why  later  I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and I don't want you to think  oh  while I was distracted by Helder  someone came onstage and swapped the bill. So I want to make sure it's exactly the same bill. Now not only that  I want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill. So even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill  I don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what I don't want to see. Is that fair  Now you can give me the marker back. And just like that  very clearly  I want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience and to make sure that everyone is going to see it  we're going to actually have a camera man onstage. Yes  perfect  so that you can see. That's your signature  Yes  Perfect. Now  we're going to use also the deck and a glass for this. And we're going to put ourselves in a position to search for an amazing coincidence. Do you mind  can you help me with this  Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle. And do you mind  can you take some cards and shuffle  You can take some cards and shuffle. You can shuffle cards in a variety of ways. You can shuffle cards like this. You can shuffle cards in a more messed up way  something like this. You can shuffle cards in the American way. As a Portuguese  I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it. But the important part is after shuffling the cards  always remember to cut and complete the cards. Do you mind doing that for me  sir  Please cut and complete. And when you have it  place the cards up in the air. And you too  cut and complete and up in the air. Up in the air. A deck of cards cut and shuffled by one  two  three  four and five people. Now  very clearly  I'm going to gather the deck together. And just like that. I'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone. I'm going to try. I have some cards that maybe  maybe they don't mean anything. But maybe that's because we are not paying close attention. Because maybe  maybe they mean a lot. Before we start  sir  you gave me a dollar bill. Is that your signature  Audience member    Yes it is. HG  I want you to see very clearly that I'm going to open your bill and reveal a small secret that we created. And the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number. Madam  can you take the dollar bill  In the serial number  there is a letter. What is the first number after the letter  Audience member    Seven. HG  Seven. Seven. But  that's maybe just one coincidence. What is the second number  Audience member    Nine. So after the seven  we have a nine. And after the nine  Audience member    Two. HG  The two. And after the two  Audience member    Three. HG  Three  and after  Audience member    Three. HG  Three. Audience member    Seven. HG  Seven. Audience member    Four. HG  Four. Audience member    Two. HG  Two  and  Audience member    Q. HG  Q like in queen  The queen of clubs  All the cards in order  just for you. And that's my show. Thank you very much and have a nice night.
