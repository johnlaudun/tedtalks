It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe  which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe. And so I think we can roll the video that we have.  The Himalayas.  The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite  unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste. It wasn't until we really left Earth  got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself  that we could understand our planet as a limited condition. The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past    years. We maintain that  put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales. What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe  as we see. NASA supported this work    years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world. The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do    our main space shows in the dome. But what you see here is the result of  actually  internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden. I've had    students work on this for their graduate work  and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden. This software allows interactive use  so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live. I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan  where I live  and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology. And so as we move out  we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies  as we see here  light travel time  giving you a sense of how far away we are. As we move out  the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long  we're essentially backing up into the past. We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us    the afterglow of the Big Bang. This is the WMAP microwave background that we see. We'll fly outside it here  just to see this sort of containment. If we were outside this  it would almost be meaningless  in the sense as before time. But this our containment of the visible universe. We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see. Coming back quickly  we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning  but these are positions  the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped  and our sun here  obviously  with our own solar system. What you're going to see    we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system    these are the paths of Voyager    Voyager    Pioneer    and Pioneer     the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system. Coming in closer  picking up Earth  orbit of the Moon  and we see the Earth. This map can be updated  and we can add in new data. I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I. for the Cassini mission. But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases  ingeniously developed so that    encounters with the largest moon  Titan  which is larger that the planet Mercury  diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase. This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this. This software can also be networked between domes. We have a growing user base of this  and we network domes. And we can network between domes and classrooms. We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia. And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school. This is an image from Saturday  photographed by the Aqua satellite  but through the Uniview software. So you're seeing the edge of the Earth. This is Nepal. This is  in fact  right here is the valley of Lhasa  right here in Tibet. But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India. This is Nepal and Tibet. And just in closing  I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on    here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out    so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is. Because our home is the universe  and we are the universe  essentially. We carry that in us. And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all  I think  in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe. Thank you. Why grow homes  Because we can. Right now  America is in an unremitting state of trauma. And there's a cause for that  all right. We've got McPeople  McCars  McHouses. As an architect  I have to confront something like this. So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses  Well  it's been around for       years. It's called pleaching  or grafting trees together  or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous  vascular system. And we do something different than what we did in the past  we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that. We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi epithetic matter  plants  into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab. It fits into the environment. It is the environment. It is the landscape  right  And you can have a hundred million of these homes  and it's great because they suck carbon. They're perfect. You can have     million families  or take things out of the suburbs  because these are homes that are a part of the environment. Imagine pre growing a village    it takes about seven to    years    and everything is green. So not only do we do the veggie house  we also do the in vitro meat habitat  or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn  where  as an architecture office  we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one. So we've been doing this for a couple of years  and that's our lab. And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs. We use a modified inkjet printer  and we print geometry. We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like  you know  shoes  leather belts  handbags  etc.  where no sentient creature is harmed. It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube. So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes. So here is a typical stud wall  an architectural construction  and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house  where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation  cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows. And we know it's incredibly ugly. It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial  but we kind of chose this shape. And there it is kind of grown  at least one particular section of it. We had a big show in Prague  and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat. That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much. Thank you very much. Please excuse me for sitting  I'm very old. Well  the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is  in a certain sense  very peculiar because it's very old. Roughness is part of human life forever and forever  and ancient authors have written about it. It was very much uncontrollable  and in a certain sense  it seemed to be the extreme of complexity  just a mess  a mess and a mess. There are many different kinds of mess. Now  in fact  by a complete fluke  I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity  and to my utter amazement  I found traces    very strong traces  I must say    of order in that roughness. And so today  I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents. I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity    to someone who had Latin in my long past youth    means the contrary of regularity. But it is not so. Regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough. So let me show you a few objects. Some of them are artificial. Others of them are very real  in a certain sense. Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower. Now why do I show a cauliflower  a very ordinary and ancient vegetable  Because old and ancient as it may be  it's very complicated and it's very simple  both at the same time. If you try to weigh it    of course it's very easy to weigh it  and when you eat it  the weight matters    but suppose you try to measure its surface. Well  it's very interesting. If you cut  with a sharp knife  one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately  you think of a whole cauliflower  but smaller. And then you cut again  again  again  again  again  again  again  again  again  and you still get small cauliflowers. So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property  that each part is like the whole  but smaller. Now  what did humanity do with that  Very  very little. So what I did actually is to study this problem  and I found something quite surprising. That one can measure roughness by a number  a number   .    .  and sometimes much more. One day  a friend of mine  to bug me  brought a picture and said   What is the roughness of this curve   I said   Well  just short of  . .  It was  .  . Now  it didn't take me any time. I've been looking at these things for so long. So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces. I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial. They were done on a computer  and the only input is a number  and that number is roughness. So on the left  I took the roughness copied from many landscapes. To the right  I took a higher roughness. So the eye  after a while  can distinguish these two very well. Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness. This is very rough  and this is sort of smooth  and this perfectly smooth. Very few things are very smooth. So then if you try to ask questions   What's the surface of a cauliflower   Well  you measure and measure and measure. Each time you're closer  it gets bigger  down to very  very small distances. What's the length of the coastline of these lakes  The closer you measure  the longer it is. The concept of length of coastline  which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases  is  in fact  complete fallacy  there's no such thing. You must do it differently. What good is that  to know these things  Well  surprisingly enough  it's good in many ways. To begin with  artificial landscapes  which I invented sort of  are used in cinema all the time. We see mountains in the distance. They may be mountains  but they may be just formulae  just cranked on. Now it's very easy to do. It used to be very time consuming  but now it's nothing. Now look at that. That's a real lung. Now a lung is something very strange. If you take this thing  you know very well it weighs very little. The volume of a lung is very small  but what about the area of the lung  Anatomists were arguing very much about that. Some say that a normal male's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball  court . And the others say  no  five basketball  courts . Enormous disagreements. Why so  Because  in fact  the area of the lung is something very ill defined. The bronchi branch  branch  branch and they stop branching  not because of any matter of principle  but because of physical considerations  the mucus  which is in the lung. So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung  but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale  for a man and for a little rodent. Now  what good is it to have that  Well  surprisingly enough  amazingly enough  the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently. And I think that my mathematics  surprisingly enough  has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses  all these branching systems  for which there was no geometry. So I found myself  in other words  constructing a geometry  a geometry of things which had no geometry. And a surprising aspect of it is that very often  the rules of this geometry are extremely short. You have formulas that long. And you crank it several times. Sometimes repeatedly  again  again  again  the same repetition. And at the end  you get things like that. This cloud is completely      percent artificial. Well    . . And the only part which is natural is a number  the roughness of the cloud  which is taken from nature. Something so complicated like a cloud  so unstable  so varying  should have a simple rule behind it. Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds. The seer of clouds had to take account of it. I don't know how much advanced these pictures are. They're old. I was very much involved in it  but then turned my attention to other phenomena. Now  here is another thing which is rather interesting. One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics  which is not appreciated by many people  occurred about     years ago      years ago. Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist. Mathematicians got into self praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing  that man can invent things that nature did not know. In particular  it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane. A curve's a curve  a plane's a plane  and the two won't mix. Well  they do mix. A man named Peano did define such curves  and it became an object of extraordinary interest. It was very important  but mostly interesting because a kind of break  a separation between the mathematics coming from reality  on the one hand  and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind. Well  I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has  in fact  seen at long last what had been seen for a long time. And so here I introduce something  the set of rivers of a plane filling curve. And well  it's a story unto itself. So it was in      to       an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world. And the objects which were used as examples  when I was a child and a student  as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality    those objects  I turned them completely around. I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature. Well  a man named Hausdorff in      introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke  and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness. When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said   Don't be silly. It's just something  silly .  Well actually  I was not silly. The great painter Hokusai knew it very well. The things on the ground are algae. He did not know the mathematics  it didn't yet exist. And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West. But painting for a long time had a fractal side. I could speak of that for a long time. The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect. I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower  and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood. This is a mess  mess  mess  Brownian loop. One day I decided    halfway through my career  I was held by so many things in my work    I decided to test myself. Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new  Well  so I looked at these things called Brownian motion    just goes around. I played with it for a while  and I made it return to the origin. Then I was telling my assistant   I don't see anything. Can you paint it   So he painted it  which means he put inside everything. He said   Well  this thing came out ...  And I said   Stop  Stop  Stop  I see  it's an island.  And amazing. So Brownian motion  which happens to have a roughness number of two  goes around. I measured it   .  . Again  again  again. Long measurements  big Brownian motions   .  . Mathematical problem  how to prove it  It took my friends    years. Three of them were having incomplete proofs. They got together  and together they had the proof. So they got the big  Fields  medal in mathematics  one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which I've seen without being able to prove them. Now everybody asks me at one point or another   How did it all start  What got you in that strange business   What got you to be  at the same time  a mechanical engineer  a geographer and a mathematician and so on  a physicist  Well actually I started  oddly enough  studying stock market prices. And so here I had this theory  and I wrote books about it    financial prices increments. To the left you see data over a long period. To the right  on top  you see a theory which is very  very fashionable. It was very easy  and you can write many books very fast about it. There are thousands of books on that. Now compare that with real price increments. Where are real price increments  Well  these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did. So the idea there was that one must be able to    how do you say     model price variation. And it went really well    years ago. For    years  people were sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much  much easier. But I tell you  at this point  people listened to me. These two curves are averages  Standard   Poor  the blue one  and the red one is Standard   Poor's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out. Now discontinuities are a nuisance  so in many studies of prices  one puts them aside.  Well  acts of God. And you have the little nonsense which is left. Acts of God.  In this picture  five acts of God are as important as everything else. In other words  it is not acts of God that we should put aside. That is the meat  the problem. If you master these  you master price  and if you don't master these  you can master the little noise as well as you can  but it's not important. Well  here are the curves for it. Now  I get to the final thing  which is the set of which my name is attached. In a way  it's the story of my life. My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France. Since I thought that I might vanish within a day or a week  I had very big dreams. And after the war  I saw an uncle again. My uncle was a very prominent mathematician  and he told me   Look  there's a problem which I could not solve    years ago  and which nobody can solve. This is a construction of a man named  Gaston  Julia and  Pierre  Fatou. If you could find something new  anything  you will get your career made.  Very simple. So I looked  and like the thousands of people that had tried before  I found nothing. But then the computer came  and I decided to apply the computer  not to new problems in mathematics    like this wiggle wiggle  that's a new problem    but to old problems. And I went from what's called real numbers  which are points on a line  to imaginary  complex numbers  which are points on a plane  which is what one should do there  and this shape came out. This shape is of an extraordinary complication. The equation is hidden there  z goes into z squared  plus c. It's so simple  so dry. It's so uninteresting. Now you turn the crank once  twice  twice  marvels come out. I mean this comes out. I don't want to explain these things. This comes out. This comes out. Shapes which are of such complication  such harmony and such beauty. This comes out repeatedly  again  again  again. And that was one of my major discoveries  to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing  more or less. And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place. All that from this little formula  which has whatever  five symbols in it. And then this one. The color was added for two reasons. First of all  because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers. And if you plot them  you must choose some system. And so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that  and others it is that or that. It's so complicated. In       I was in Cambridge  U.K. to receive a prize from the university  and three days later  a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing. So where did this come from  Obviously  from extraterrestrials. Well  so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that  discovery  and received the next day       letters from people saying   But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big.  Well  let me finish. This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics. Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules  which are repeated without end. Thank you very much. I'm Ellen  and I'm totally obsessed with food. But I didn't start out obsessed with food. I started out obsessed with global security policy because I lived in New York during       and it was obviously a very relevant thing. And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry  I'm really pissed off  and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too. Especially if you're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry  you're pretty angry. And actually  lo and behold  it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure. So I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues. And while I was there  I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs. It's called School Feeding  and it's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world  and stop it. By giving kids a free school meal  it gets them into school  which is obviously education  the first step out of poverty  but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically. While I was working at the U.N.  I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush. And she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the  Feed Bag     which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag. But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid. It's so simple  and we thought  you know  okay  it costs between    and    bucks to provide school feeding for a year. We could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the World Food Programme. But of course  you know at the U.N.  sometimes things move slowly  and they basically said no. And we thought  God  this is such a good idea and it's going to raise so much money. So we said screw it  we'll just start our own company  which we did three years ago. So that was kind of my first dream  was to start this company called FEED  and here's a screenshot of our website. We did this bag for Haiti  and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in Haiti. So FEED's doing great. We've so far provided    million meals to kids around the world by selling now         bags  a ton of bags  a lot of bags. All this time you're    when you think about hunger  it's a hard thing to think about  because what we think about is eating. I think about eating a lot  and I really love it. And the thing that's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know   What are you doing in America    What are you doing for America's kids   There's definitely hunger in America     million people and almost   .  million children. I mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country. Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally  but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country. But obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity  and it's dramatic. The other thing that's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last    years. Unfortunately  obesity's not only an American problem. It's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting. The numbers are pretty crazy. There's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry. So those seem like two bifurcated problems  but I kind of started to think about  you know  what is obesity and hunger  What are both those things about  Well  they're both about food. And when you think about food  the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture. And agriculture is where food comes from. Well  agriculture in America's very interesting. It's very consolidated  and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat. Well  the foods that are produced are  more or less  corn  soy and wheat. And as you can see  that's three quarters of the food that we're eating for the most part  processed foods and fast foods. Unfortunately  in our agricultural system  we haven't done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world. So African agriculture  which is the place of most hunger in the world  has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen. So somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world. Who is farming them  That's what I was wondering. So I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest  and that really didn't help me understand farming  but I think it's a really cool picture. And you know  the reality is that between farmers in America  who actually  quite frankly  when I spend time in the Midwest  are pretty large in general. And their farms are also large. But farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny  and that's because they're starving. Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers. And most of those people are women    which is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now  but I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point. I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides. There's this large  consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America  and it's really been since around       after the oil crisis  when  you know  mass consolidation  mass exodus of small farmers in this country. And then in the same time period  you know  we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing. Unfortunately  what is farmed ends up as what we eat. And in America  a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last    years. It's crazy. A fifth of kids under two drinks soda. Hello. You don't put soda in bottles. But people do because it's so cheap  and so our whole food system in the last    years has really shifted. I think  you know  it's not just in our own country  but really we're exporting the system around the world  and when you look at the data of least developed countries    especially in cities  which are growing really rapidly    people are eating American processed foods. And in one generation  they're going from hunger  and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger  to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation. So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity. Not to beat a dead horse  but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese. I think that's the only way to look at it. And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate  it's really important to look at them as one system. We get a lot of our food from all around the world  and people from all around the world are importing our food system  so it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it. The thing is  I've learned    and the technology people that are here  which I'm totally not one of them    but apparently  it really takes    years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us  like the mouse and the Internet and Windows. You know  there's    year cycles. I think      can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the    year cycle  and it's the birthday of the global food system. So that's the first birthday I want to talk about. You know  I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last    years  there's hope in that. It's the thirtieth anniversary of GMO crops and the Big Gulp  Chicken McNuggets  high fructose corn syrup  the farm crisis in America and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally. So there's a lot of reasons to take this    year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system. I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole    year thing. The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change. Well  I really care about      because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year. And so in my lifetime  a lot of what's happened in the world    and being a person obsessed with food    a lot of this has really changed. So my second dream is that I think we can look to the next    years as a time to change the food system again. And we know what's happened in the past  so if we start now  and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term  we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm    years old  I'll be able to say that it's been a success. So I'm announcing today the start of a new organization  or a new fund within the FEED Foundation  called the    Project. And the    Project is really focused on these long term ideas for food system change. And I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity  we might actually look for long term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone. We all tend to think that these systems are quite different  and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world  but if we take a    year view  there's more hope in collaborative ideas. So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the ONE campaign and Slow Food  which don't seem right now to have much in common  we can talk about holistic  long term  systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone. Some ideas I've had is like  look  the reality is    kids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in Botswana. And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods  Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish. Understanding how to produce protein in a way that's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers. And you know  these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters. And I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way  where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips. Well  if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple  then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made just from corn  soy and wheat. The   Project.org is launched  and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start. And it'll be growing over the next few months. But I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change. Trees epitomize stasis. Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations  but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs  trees become very dynamic entities  moving and growing. And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists. I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas  and that produced art. The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir  and what I learned was that different species have different signatures  like a Picasso versus a Monet. But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it  so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree    which produced this painting    moved in a single year  I simply measured and summed each of those lines. I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year. You might have a guess. The answer is actually         miles  or seven times around the globe. And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs  we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities  but rather extremely dynamic. And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees  to consider other entities that are also static and stuck  but which cry for change and dynamicism  and one of those entities is our prisons. Prisons  of course  are where people who break our laws are stuck  confined behind bars. And our prison system itself is stuck. The United States has over  .  million incarcerated men and women. That number is rising. Of the     incarcerated people that are released     will return to prison. Funds for education  for training and for rehabilitation are declining  so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons  and I think the answer is yes. In the year       I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections. Working with four prisons  we began bringing science and scientists  sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. We give science lectures  and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting. That  I think  is movement. We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state. That  I think  is movement. We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs    the Oregon spotted frog    for later release into protected wetlands. That  I think  is movement. And just recently  we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. They're kept in bare cells like this for    hours a day. When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals  they're placed in immobile booths like this. For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments  we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards  putting them on the walls  so at least they get contact with visual images of nature. This is Mr. Lopez  who has been in solitary confinement for    months  and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene  more calm  less apt to violence. And so what we see  I think  is that small  collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope. We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks. But if trees can create art  if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year  if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs  then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves  like grief  like addictions  like racism  that can also change. Thank you very much. I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people  and that was in     . I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future  but I will not use digital technology  as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead  I have progressed  and I am  today  launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA  this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world        had one billion people. In the developing world  she said  they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world  people were healthy  educated  rich  and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in       all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this  in the developing world  far away  the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world  which we still use linguistically when we talk about  the West  and  the Developing World.  But the world has changed  and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world  and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you  because since      what has happened in the world up to      is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course  there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy  so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries  they have moved on  you know  and they have become emerging economies  we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company  Geely  they acquired the Volvo company  and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes  they are still almost as poor as they were    years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions  the three billions here  which are also becoming emerging economies  because they are quite healthy  relatively well educated  and they already also have two to three children per woman  as those  richer also  have. And their aspiration now is  of course  to buy a bicycle  and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today  no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here  the very poorest  to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking  biking  driving  flying    there are people on all levels  and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in     . And what will happen in the future  Well  I'm going to project into     . I was in Shanghai recently  and I listened to what's happening in China  and it's pretty sure that they will catch up  just as Japan did. All the projections  say that  this one  billion  will  only  grow with one to two or three percent.  But this second  grows with seven  eight percent  and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries  the emerging income countries  they will also forge forwards economically. And if  but only if  we invest in the right green technology    so that we can avoid severe climate change  and energy can still be relatively cheap    then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion  What about the poorest two billion here  Will they move on  Well  here population  growth  comes in because there  among emerging economies  we already have two to three children per woman  family planning is widely used  and population growth is coming to an end. Here  among the poorest   population is growing. So these  poorest  two billion will  in the next decades  increase to three billion  and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing    but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen    that can stop this  growth  from happening. Because we already have this  growth  in process. But if  and only if   the poorest  get out of poverty  they get education  they get improved child survival  they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come  to live  here  then population growth will stop in     . We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas  dark blue is Africa  brown is Europe  green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman  two children  four children  six children  eight children    big families  small families. The year is     . And down here  child survival  the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school     percent     percent     percent      and almost     percent  as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look  this is the world my teacher talked about in       one billion Western world here    high child survival  small families    and all the rest  the rainbow of developing countries  with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened  I start the world. Here we go. Can you see  as the years pass by  child survival is increasing  They get soap  hygiene  education  vaccination  penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.  When  they get up to    percent child survival  then families decrease  and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there  to small families . Look  Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size  but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion  those  two  boxes I had over here  They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only    to    percent  meaning that if you have six children born  there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population  growth  to stop is to continue to improve child survival to    percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation  UNICEF and aid organizations  together with national government in the poorest countries  are so good  because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen  Well  I'm not an optimist  neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious  possibilist.  It's a new category where we take emotion apart  and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty  and global governance  the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone  leading the world  living its own life. This will not happen  again . The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world    nothing more  nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. This is the ocean as I used to know it. And I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times  I really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now  no matter where I am  even where I know none of the oil has gone  I sort of see slicks  and I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it. But what I want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context  not just about the oil eruption  but what it means and why it has happened. First  just a little bit about me. I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid  and because I did  I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved. And now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing  and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly. Now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on  that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it. It's like you dipped a marble in water. And the same thing with the atmosphere  If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball  you would get that little sphere of gas on the right. So we live on the most fragile  little soap bubble you can imagine  a very sacred soap bubble  but one that is very  very easy to affect. And all the burning of oil and coal and gas  all the fossil fuels  have changed the atmosphere greatly. Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up. We're warming the climate. So the blowout in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization. Beyond warming  we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified    and already measurably so  and already affecting animals. Now in the laboratory  if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is    not  .   which is the normal pH of seawater    but  .   it dissolves in about three days. If you take a sea urchin larva from  .   put it in a pH of  .     not a huge change    it becomes deformed and dies. And already  commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places. Coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem. So this really matters. Now  let's take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit. One of the things that really impresses me about the people in the Gulf  They are really  really aquatic people. And they can handle water. They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes. When the water goes down  they know what to do. But when it's something other than water  and their water habitat changes  they don't have many options. In fact  those entire communities really don't have many options. They don't have another thing they can do. They can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community. If you go to the Gulf and you look around  you do see a lot of oil. You see a lot of oil on the ocean. You see a lot of oil on the shoreline. If you go to the site of the blowout  it looks pretty unbelievable. It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car  and you just dumped it in the ocean. And one of the really most incredible things  I think  is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest. Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic. You go in along the shore  you can find it everywhere. It's really messy. If you go to the places where it's just arriving  like the eastern part of the Gulf  in Alabama  there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach. And they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach. They're not allowed to put more than    pounds of sand in a    gallon plastic bag. They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags. I don't know what they're going to do with all that stuff. Meanwhile  there are still people trying to use the beach. They don't see the little  tiny sign that says   Stay out of the water.  Their kids are in the water  they're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals. It's a mess. If you go to the place where the oil has been a while  it's an even bigger mess. And there's basically nobody there anymore  a few people trying to keep using it. You see people who are really shell shocked. They are very hardworking people. All they know about life is they get up in the morning  and if their engine starts  they go to work. They always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the Gulf. They're finding that their world is really collapsing. And so you can see  literally  signs of their shock  signs of their outrage  signs of their anger  and signs of their grief. These are the things that you can see. There's a lot you can't see  also  underwater. What's going on underwater  Well  some people say there are oil plumes. Some people say there are not oil plumes. And Congressman Markey asks  you know   Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes   But I couldn't take a submarine ride    especially between the time I knew I was coming here and today    so I had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico. So this is the Gulf of Mexico  sparkling place full of fish. I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. And I learned    in fact  I confirmed    the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix until you add a dispersant  and then they start mixing. And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves  and you get a big mess  a big mess that you can't possibly clean  you can't touch  you can't extract and  I think most importantly    this is what I think    you can't see it. I think it's being hidden on purpose. Now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess  that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream. But as many people have said  there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on. Personally  I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body  because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene. But you can see it. You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface  and then it is attacked  because they don't want the evidence  in my opinion. Okay. We heard that bacteria eat oil  So do sea turtles. When it breaks up  it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria. Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish. These guys have to swim around through it. I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here. A writer named Ted Williams called me  and he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw  because he's writing an article for Audubon magazine. He said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago    like about a week ago    and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what's going on. That guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings. He has no bookings left. Everybody wanted their deposit back. Everybody is fleeing. That's the story of thousands of people. But he told Ted that on the last day he went out  a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat  and it was splattering oil out its blowhole. And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip  and he knew that the dolphins scare fish. So he moved away from it  turned around a few minutes later  it was right next to the side of the boat again. He said that in    years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that. And he felt that    he felt that it was coming to ask for help. Sorry. Now  in the Exxon Valdez spill  about    percent of the killer whales died in the first few months. Their numbers have never recovered. So the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable. It's going to take longer for some things. And some things  I think  will probably come back a little faster. The other thing about the Gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year. So the Gulf is a really important piece of water    more important than a similar volume of water in the open Atlantic Ocean. These tuna swim the entire ocean. They get in the Gulf Stream. They go all the way to Europe. When it comes time to spawn  they come inside  and these two tuna that were tagged  you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick. They're probably having  at the very least  a catastrophic spawning season this year. I'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water. They don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway. But these are really high performance athletic animals. I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills. I don't know if it'll affect the adults. If it's not  it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae  I would certainly think. But if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down  that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades. So while the oil spill  the leak  the eruption  is a catastrophe  I think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very  very long time. It's not like we're starting with something that's been okay. We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with. If you look around at the birds  there are a lot of birds in the Gulf that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year  but then leave. And they populate much larger areas. So for instance  most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds. They were all on the Gulf in May  while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places. Down on the lower left there are Ruddy Turnstones and Sanderlings. They breed in the high arctic  and they winter down in southern South America. But they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the arctic. I saw birds that breed in Greenland in the Gulf  so this is a hemispheric issue. The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways. The biological effects are certainly hemispheric. I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind boggling examples of total unpreparedness that I can even think of. Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor  at least they shot back. And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do. There was nothing ready  and  you know  as we can see by what they're doing. Mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants. The booms are absolutely not made for open water. They don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated. They get near shore. Look at these two boats. That one on the right is called Fishing Fool. And I think  you know  that's a great name for boats that think that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface. The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms. The booms are only about    inches in diameter. So it's just absolutely crazy. Here are shrimp boats employed. There are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets. Here they are working. You can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom. All they're doing is stirring it. It's just ridiculous. Also  for all the shoreline that has booms    hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline    all of the shoreline that has booms  there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms. There is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them. And that lower photo  that's a bird colony that has been boomed. Everybody's trying to protect the bird colonies there. Well  as an ornithologist  I can tell you that birds fly  and that    and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it  it doesn't do it. These birds make a living by diving into the water. In fact  really what I think they should do  if anything    they're trying so hard to protect those nests    actually  if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave  and that would be better for them this year. As far as cleaning them  I don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds. It's really  really important that we express our compassion. I think that's the most important thing that people have  is compassion. It's really important to get those images and to show it. But really  where are those birds going to get released to  It's like taking somebody out of a burning building  treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building  because the oil is still gushing. I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident. I think that this is the result of gross negligence. Not just B.P. B.P. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could. And they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that's supposed to be our government  protecting us. It turns out that    you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the United States    you know  if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil  you would be in big trouble. And you have to really wonder who are the laws made for  and who has gotten above the laws. Now there are things that we can do in the future. We could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need. It would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making        holes in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil  oil might start coming out of one of them. And you'd have some idea of what to do. That's certainly one of the things we need to do. But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from. It really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government  meant to protect the larger public interest. So I think that the oil blowout  the bank bailout  the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause. We still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people. And even though the police can be a little annoying at times    giving us tickets and stuff like that    nobody says that we should just get rid of them. But in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least    years  there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from  buying the government out from under us. Now this has been a problem for a very  very long time. You can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America  and even Thomas Jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country. Okay  people who say they're conservative  if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic  they would tell these corporations to go to hell. That's what it would really mean to be conservative. So what we really need to do is regain the idea that it's our government safeguarding our interests and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost. I think there are signs of hope. We seem to be waking up a little bit. The Glass Steagall Act    which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen  and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts    that was put in effect in       was systematically destroyed. Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place  but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed. So it's a continued fight. It's a historic moment right now. We're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the Gulf  or we will make the moment we need out of this  as many people have noted today. There's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this. We've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling. The first offshore wells were called whales. The first offshore drills were called harpoons. We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time. Now are we stuck with this  Ever since we lived in caves  every time we wanted any energy  we lit something on fire  and that is still what we're doing. We're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy. And people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive. Who says it's too expensive  People who sell us fossil fuels. We've been here before with energy  and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch  because the cheapest energy was slavery. Energy is always a moral issue. It's an issue that is moral right now. It's a matter of right and wrong. Thank you very much. When I was a student here in Oxford in the     s  the future of the world was bleak. The population explosion was unstoppable. Global famine was inevitable. A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives. The acid rain was falling on the forests. The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year. The oil was running out  and a nuclear winter would finish us off. None of those things happened  and astonishingly  if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime  the average per capita income of the average person on the planet  in real terms  adjusted for inflation  has tripled. Lifespan is up by    percent in my lifetime. Child mortality is down by two thirds. Per capita food production is up by a third. And all this at a time when the population has doubled. How did we achieve that  whether you think it's a good thing or not  How did we achieve that  How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous  The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population  and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita. I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine  to meet and  indeed  to mate. In other words  you need to understand how ideas have sex. I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this. These are both real objects. One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus. The other is obviously a computer mouse. They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree. I've tried to work out which is bigger  and it's almost impossible. And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand. They're both technologies. In the end  their similarity is not that interesting. It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand. The differences are what interest me  because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years    from one and a half million years ago to half a million years ago. Homo erectus made the same tool for        generations. Of course there were a few changes  but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days. There was no progress  no innovation. It's an extraordinary phenomenon  but it's true. Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years. And there's another difference too  which is the object on the left is made from one substance. The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances  from silicon and metal and plastic and so on. And more than that  it's a confection of different ideas  the idea of plastic  the idea of a laser  the idea of transistors. They've all been combined together in this technology. And it's this combination  this cumulative technology  that intrigues me  because I think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world. My body's an accumulation of ideas too  the idea of skin cells  the idea of brain cells  the idea of liver cells. They've come together. How does evolution do cumulative  combinatorial things  Well  it uses sexual reproduction. In an asexual species  if you get two different mutations in different creatures  a green one and a red one  then one has to be better than the other. One goes extinct for the other to survive. But if you have a sexual species  then it's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages. So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species. It's not confined to its own lineage. What's the process that's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution  And I think the answer is exchange  the habit of exchanging one thing for another. It's a unique human feature. No other animal does it. You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange    and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals    But the exchange of one object for another never happens. As Adam Smith said   No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog.  You can have culture without exchange. You can have  as it were  asexual culture. Chimpanzees  killer whales  these kinds of creatures  they have culture. They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring. In this case  chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks. But the difference is that these cultures never expand  never grow  never accumulate  never become combinatorial  and the reason is because there is no sex  as it were  there is no exchange of ideas. Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops. There's no exchange of ideas between them. And why does exchange raise living standards  Well  the answer came from David Ricardo in     . And here is a Stone Age version of his story  although he told it in terms of trade between countries. Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe. Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe. So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam. He doesn't need Adam. He can make his own spears and axes. Well no  because if you think about it  if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes  and then they trade  then they will each have saved an hour of work. And the more they do this  the more true it's going to be  because the more they do this  the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears. So the gains from trade are only going to grow. And this is one of the beauties of exchange  is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization  which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on. Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time. That is prosperity  the saving of time in satisfying your needs. Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by. If you had to start from scratch  let's say you go out into the countryside. You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it. You render it down. You make a candle  etc. etc. How long is it going to take you  Quite a long time. How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today  And the answer is about half a second. Back in       you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light. And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since       as it were  because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else  or you can acquire another good or service. And back in       it would have been    minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage. Back in       you'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour. In other words  the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in     . Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse  and ask yourself   Who made them and for who   The stone axe was made by someone for himself. It was self sufficiency. We call that poverty these days. But the object on the right was made for me by other people. How many other people  Tens  Hundreds  Thousands  You know  I think it's probably millions. Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee  which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig  who was drilling for oil  which was going to be made into the plastic  etc. They were all working for me  to make a mouse for me. And that's the way society works. That's what we've achieved as a species. In the old days  if you were rich  you literally had people working for you. That's how you got to be rich  you employed them. Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him. They made his silly outfits  like this  and they did his silly hairstyles  or whatever. He had     people to prepare his dinner every night. But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV's pictures  he has     people doing his dinner tonight too. They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris  and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal that's probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had. And that's what we've done  because we're all working for each other. We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other's living standards. Now  you do get other animals working for each other too. Ants are a classic example  workers work for queens and queens work for workers. But there's a big difference  which is that it only happens within the colony. There's no working for each other across the colonies. And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor. That is to say  they specialize with respect to reproduction. The queen does it all. In our species  we don't like doing that. It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves  is reproduction. Even in England  we don't leave reproduction to the Queen. So when did this habit start  And how long has it been going on  And what does it mean  Well  I think  probably  the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor. But I've got no evidence for that. It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male. In all hunter gatherer societies today  there's a foraging division of labor between  on the whole  hunting males and gathering females. It isn't always quite that simple  but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females. And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides. The woman knows that  in the Hadzas' case here    digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat    she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat. And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog. And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging to get roots. All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it's big enough to share some. And so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor. When did this happen  We don't know  but it's possible that Neanderthals didn't do this. They were a highly cooperative species. They were a highly intelligent species. Their brains on average  by the end  were bigger than yours and mine in this room today. They were imaginative. They buried their dead. They had language  probably  because we know they had the FOXP  gene of the same kind as us  which was discovered here in Oxford. And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills. They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals. But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor. There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females. It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men. And the other thing there's no evidence for is exchange between groups  because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains  the tools they made  are always made from local materials. For example  in the Caucasus there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools. They're always made from local chert. In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date         years ago  and some of those are from local chert  but more    but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away. And when human beings began moving objects around like this  it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups. Trade is    times as old as farming. People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing. Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years. And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between    and         years ago in Africa  when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia. You also see seashells    as discovered by a team here in Oxford    moving     miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria. And that's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups. And that will have led to specialization. How do you know that long distance movement means trade rather than migration  Well  you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals  who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa  which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe. They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs  and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia. So long distance movement of tools is a sign of trade  not migration. What happens when you cut people off from exchange  from the ability to exchange and specialize  And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress  you can actually throw it into reverse. An example is Tasmania. When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island        years ago  the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland  they actually experienced regress. They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about       people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had. It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island. How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after        years  It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego    similar island  similar people. The reason  because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight  and there was trading contact across that straight throughout        years. The Tasmanians were isolated. Go back to this image again and ask yourself  not only who made it and for who  but who knew how to make it. In the case of the stone axe  the man who made it knew how to make it. But who knows how to make a computer mouse  Nobody  literally nobody. There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse. I mean this quite seriously. The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know. He just knows how to run a company. The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic  and so on. We all know little bits  but none of us knows the whole. I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read  the economist in the     s  called  I  Pencil  in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made  and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil  because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite  and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing. And what we've done in human society  through exchange and specialization  is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand. It's not the same with language. With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other. But with technology  we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities. We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree. And by the way  that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q.  about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. It's completely irrelevant. What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas  and how well they're cooperating  not how clever the individuals are. So we've created something called the collective brain. We're just the nodes in the network. We're the neurons in this brain. It's the interchange of ideas  the meeting and mating of ideas between them  that is causing technological progress  incrementally  bit by bit. However  bad things happen. And in the future  as we go forward  we will  of course  experience terrible things. There will be wars  there will be depressions  there will be natural disasters. Awful things will happen in this century  I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure that  because of the connections people are making  and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before  I'm also sure that technology will advance  and therefore living standards will advance. Because through the cloud  through crowd sourcing  through the bottom up world that we've created  where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate  we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation. Thank you. I'm an American  which means  generally  I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno's size running into each other at extremely high speeds. That said  it's been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks. I go onto Twitter  there are all these strange words that I've never heard before  FIFA  vuvuzela  weird jokes about octopi. But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out  that I haven't been able to figure out  is this phrase  Cala a boca  Galvao.  If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks  you've probably seen this. It's been a major trending topic. Being a monolingual American  I obviously don't know what the phrase means. So I went onto Twitter  and I asked some people if they could explain to me  Cala a boca  Galvao.  And fortunately  my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help. They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that's in terrible  terrible danger. In fact  I'll let them tell you a bit more about it. Narrator  A word about Galvao  a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil. Every year  more than         Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades. Ethan Zuckerman  Obviously  this is a tragic situation  and it actually gets worse. It turns out that  not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive  useful for headdresses  it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties  which means that there's a terrible problem with Galvao abuse. Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao. And it's terribly endangered. The good news about this is that the global community    again  my Brazilian friends tell me    is pitching in to help out. It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single    actually five or six new singles  as near as I can tell    titled  Cala a boca  Galvao.  And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase  Cala a boca  Galvao      cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird. Now  most of you have figured out that this was a prank  and actually a very  very good one.  Cala a boca  Galvao  actually means something very different. In Portugese  it means  Shut your mouth  Galvao.  And it specifically refers to this guy  Galvao Bueno  who's the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo. And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine. He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again. So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea  put up this banner  started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase   Cala a boca  Galvao.  And in fact  were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks. Now there's a couple    there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this. And the first lesson  which I think is a worthwhile one  is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online  so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase. So as long as activism is that simple  it's pretty easy to get away with. The other thing you can take from this  by the way  is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter. There's more than five million of them. As far as national representation     percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter. That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K. Next to Japan  it's the second most represented by population. Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks  and you didn't realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it  you're like most of us. Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with. And if you are like me  a big  geeky  white  American guy  you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky  white  American guys. And you don't necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space. It's also extremely surprising to many Americans  a heavily African American space. Twitter recently did some research. They looked at their local population. They believe that    percent of American Twitter users are African American. That's about twice as high as African Americans are represented in the population. And again  that was very shocking to many Twitter users  but it shouldn't be. And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics. And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African American conversations. This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg  two amazing visualization designers  who looked at a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations    and in ways that you wouldn't expect. It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation  that cookout is a mostly black conversation. And what's crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter  it's literally a quick click away. You click on that cookout tag  there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it. But generally speaking  most of us don't. We end up within these filter bubbles  as my friend Eli Pariser calls them  where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know. And we tend not to see that wider picture. Now for me  I'm surprised by this  because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be. If you go back into the early days of the internet  when cyber utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like  Being Digital   the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences  to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another. Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms. He's at a technology conference in Florida. And he's looking at something really  truly absurd  which is bottles of Evian water on the table. And Negroponte says this is crazy. This is the old economy. It's the economy of moving these heavy  slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do. We're heading to the future of bits  where everything is speedy  it's weightless. It can be anywhere in the world at any time. And it's going to change the world as we know it. Now  Negroponte has been right about a lot of things. He's totally wrong about this one. It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits. If I walk into a store in the United States  it's very  very easy for me to buy water that's bottled in Fiji  shipped at great expense to the United States. It's actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film. It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music. It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news  which is strange  because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji. There's a coup government. There's a military government. There's crackdowns on the press. It's actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment. Here's what I think is going on. I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization. We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world. And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes. It includes things like the Internet cables. We look at a map like this one  and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away. You can get on a flight in London  you can end up in Bangalore later today. Two hops  you're in Suva  the capitol of Fiji. It's all right there. When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks  you get a very different picture. You start looking at how the global plane flights move  and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat. It's extremely lumpy. There are parts of the world that are very  very well connected. There's basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York. but look at this map  and you can watch this for  you know  two or three minutes. You won't see very many planes go from South America to Africa. And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off. When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible  and we look at what actually happens  we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does. So here's the problem that I've been interested in in the last decade or so. The world is  in fact  getting more global. It's getting more connected. More of problems are global in scale. More of our economics is global in scale. And our media is less global by the day. If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the     s     to    percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast. That's down to about    to    percent. And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world. Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk. Alisa's the president of Public Radio International. And she made a cartogram  which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month. And you see that when you distort a map based on attention  the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S. and a couple of other countries which we've invaded. And that's basically what our media is about. And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news    which is dreadful  and I agree that it's dreadful    I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times  and I get the same thing. When you look at the New York Times  you look at other elite media  what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we've invaded. It turns out that new media isn't necessarily helping us all that much. Here's a map made by Mark Graham who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute. A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo coded. And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe. Even within Wikipedias  where we're creating their own content online  there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based  rather than to the rest of the world. In the U.K.  you can get up  you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session  you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia  from Canada  God forbid from the U.S. You probably won't. If you look at online media consumption    in this case  in the top    users of the internet    more than    percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites. It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than  the U.K.   because we actually like reading your media  rather than vice versa. So all of this starts leading me to think that we're in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism. We look at the internet. We think we're getting this wide view of the globe. We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese  and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world. And we forget that most of the time we're checking Boston Red Sox scores. So this is a real problem    not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year    but it's a real problem because  as we're discussing here at TED  the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope  they require global conversations to get to global solutions. This is a problem we have to solve. So here's the good news. For six years  I've been hanging out with these guys. This is a group called Global Voices. This is a team of bloggers from around the world. Our mission was to fix the world's media. We started in     . You might have noticed  we haven't done all that well so far. Nor do I think we are by ourselves  actually going to solve the problem. But the more that I think about it  the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world. The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention. In this case    the map of the world at night by NASA    they're dark literally because of lack of electricity. And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you're not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs. What I'm starting to realize is that you can get media  it's just an enormous amount of work  and you need an enormous amount of encouragement. One of those dark spots is Madagascar  a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there. And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country. They were doing something much simpler. It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet. but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup. Most independent media was shut down. And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations  the violence  everything that was going on within this country. So a very  very small program designed to get people in front of computers  publishing their own thoughts  publishing independent media  ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country. Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing most people here don't speak Malagasy. I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese    which is sort of sad if you think about it  as it's now the most represented language on the internet. Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this. If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site  you notice this really cute box at the top  which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page. Unfortunately  it's a machine translation of the page. And while Google is very  very good with some languages  it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese. And the results can be pretty funny. What you really want    what I really want  is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this. And if you think this is absurd  it's not. There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan. And Yeeyan is a group of         volunteers who get online every day. They look for the most interesting content in the English language. They translate roughly     articles a day from major newspapers  major websites. They put it online for free. It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei  who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn't believe how biased American media coverage was. And he said   If there's one thing I can do  I can start translating  so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better.  And my question to you is  if Yeeyan can line up         people to translate the English internet into Chinese  where's the English language Yeeyan  Who's going after Chinese  which now has     million internet users out there  My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say. So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese  there's no guarantee that we're going to find it. When we look for information online  we basically have two strategies. We use a lot of search. And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for. But if what you're looking for is serendipity  if you want to stumble onto something that you didn't know you needed  our main philosophy is to look to our social networks  to look for our friends. What are they looking at  Maybe we should be looking at it. The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock. You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you  who have similar interests. And it's very  very hard to get information from the other flocks  from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests. To do this  at a certain point  you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock. You need a guide. So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices. She has one of the hardest jobs in the world. Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other  she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East. And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit  and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who's given up smoking for the month of Ramadan  she has to know something about a global audience. She has to know something about what stories are available. Basically  she's a deejay. She's a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her  who's able to listen to the audience  and who's able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another. I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process. I think what's great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience. I know Amira. I can ask her what to read. But with the internet  she's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read. And you can listen to her as well  if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened. So once you start widening like this  once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots  once you start translating  once you start curating  you end up in some really weird places. This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog  which is AfriGadget. And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context. And specifically  it's looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi  who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel. And when you look at this image  you might find yourself going   Why would I conceivably care about this   And the truth is  this guy can probably explain this to you. This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference. He goes by the moniker White African. He's both a very well known American geek  but he's also Kenyan  he was born in Sudan  grew up in Kenya. He is a bridge figure. He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds    one in the world of the African technology community  one in the world of the American technology community. And so he's able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology  about innovating from constraint  about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials. He knows one world  and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world  both of which he has deep connections to. These bridge figures  I'm pretty well convinced  are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web. But the trick with bridges is  ultimately  you need someone to cross them. And that's where we start talking about xenophiles. So if I found myself in the NFL  I suspect I would spend my off season nursing my wounds  enjoying my house  so on and so forth    possibly recording a hip hop album. Dhani Jones  who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals  has a slightly different approach to the off season. Dhani has a television show. It's called  Dhani Tackles the Globe.  And every week on this television show  Dhani travels to a different nation of the world. He finds a local sporting team. He trains with them for a week  and he plays a match with them. And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing. It's because  for him  sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world. For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food. For a lot of us it might be literature or writing. But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it. The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia. My guess    given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal    is that most of you are xenophiles  whether or not you use that term. My challenge instead is this. It's not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world. We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have. We have to fix our media. We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education. We have to fix our immigration policy. We need to look at ways of creating serendipity  of making translation pervasive  and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures. And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles. That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help. I'm a storyteller. That's what I do in life    telling stories  writing novels    and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni. But before I go there  please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story. I will do so with the help of words  of course  but also a geometrical shape  the circle  so throughout my talk  you will come across several circles. I was born in Strasbourg  France to Turkish parents. Shortly after  my parents got separated  and I came to Turkey with my mom. From then on  I was raised as a single child by a single mother. Now in the early     s  in Ankara  that was a bit unusual. Our neighborhood was full of large families  where fathers were the heads of households  so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment. In fact  I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood. On the one hand was my mother  a well educated  secular  modern  westernized  Turkish woman. On the other hand was my grandmother  who also took care of me and was more spiritual  less educated and definitely less rational. This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye. Many people visited my grandmother  people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands. Each time  my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic  take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove. Then one by one  she would encircle these thorns with dark ink. A week later  the patient would come back for a follow up examination. Now  I'm aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists  but the truth is  of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions  I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed. I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying  In response she said   Yes  praying is effective  but also beware of the power of circles.  From her  I learned  amongst many other things  one very precious lesson    that if you want to destroy something in this life  be it an acne  a blemish or the human soul  all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls. It will dry up inside. Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle. We all do. We're born into a certain family  nation  class. But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted  then we too run the risk of drying up inside. Our imagination might shrink  our hearts might dwindle  and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons. Our friends  neighbors  colleagues  family    if all the people in our inner circle resemble us  it means we are surrounded with our mirror image. Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out. It's an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection. Ironically   living in  communities of the like minded is one of the greatest dangers of today's globalized world. And it's happening everywhere  among liberals and conservatives  agnostics and believers  the rich and the poor  East and West alike. We tend to form clusters based on similarity  and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people. In my opinion  one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling. Stories cannot demolish frontiers  but they can punch holes in our mental walls. And through those holes  we can get a glimpse of the other  and sometimes even like what we see. I started writing fiction at the age of eight. My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal. In retrospect  I think she was slightly worried about my sanity. I was constantly telling stories at home  which was good  except I told this to imaginary friends around me  which was not so good. I was an introverted child  to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them  so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day to day experiences and emotions. What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring  and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself. Instead  I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened. And thus began my life long passion for writing fiction. So from the very beginning  fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives  other possibilities. And please bear with me  I'll draw a circle and come back to this point. Now one other thing happened around this same time. My mother became a diplomat. So from this small  superstitious  middle class neighborhood of my grandmother  I was zoomed into this posh  international school  in Madrid   where I was the only Turk. It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the  representative foreigner.  In our classroom  there were children from all nationalities  yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan  egalitarian classroom democracy. Instead  it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen    not as an individual on his own  but as the representative of something larger. We were like a miniature United Nations  which was fun  except whenever something negative  with regards to a nation or a religion  took place. The child who represented it was mocked  ridiculed and bullied endlessly. And I should know  because during the time I attended that school  a military takeover happened in my country  a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope  and Turkey got zero points in  the  Eurovision Song Contest. I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days. I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there. The other children asked me about the movie  Midnight Express   which I had not seen  they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked  because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers  and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair. I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country  politics  cigarettes and the veil. After Spain  we went to Jordan  Germany and Ankara again. Everywhere I went  I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me. Stories gave me a sense of center  continuity and coherence  the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked. In my mid twenties  I moved to Istanbul  the city I adore. I lived in a very vibrant  diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels. I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in     . When I ran out of the building at three in the morning  I saw something that stopped me in my tracks. There was the local grocer there    a grumpy  old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals. He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks. I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her  and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today    a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk. In the face of death and destruction  our mundane differences evaporated  and we all became one even if for a few hours. But I've always believed that stories  too  have a similar effect on us. I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake  but when we are reading a good novel  we leave our small  cozy apartments behind  go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against. Shortly after  I went to a women's college in Boston  then Michigan. I experienced this  not so much as a geographical shift  as a linguistic one. I started writing fiction in English. I'm not an immigrant  refugee or exile    they ask me why I do this    but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself. I love writing in Turkish  which to me is very poetic and very emotional  and I love writing in English  which to me is very mathematical and cerebral. So I feel connected to each language in a different way. For me  like millions of other people around the world today  English is an acquired language. When you're a latecomer to a language  what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration. As latecomers  we always want to say more  you know  crack better jokes  say better things  but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue. And that gap is very intimidating. But if we manage not to be frightened by it  it's also stimulating. And this is what I discovered in Boston    that frustration was very stimulating. At this stage  my grandmother  who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety  started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all. And because God loves her  I did get married. But instead of settling down  I went to Arizona. And since my husband is in Istanbul  I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul    the two places on the surface of earth that couldn't be more different. I guess one part of me has always been a nomad  physically and spiritually. Stories accompany me  keeping my pieces and memories together  like an existential glue. Yet as much as I love stories  recently  I've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story. And this is a subject that I would love to think about together. When my first novel written in English came out in America  I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.  I liked your book   he said   but I wish you had written it differently.  I asked him what he meant by that. He said   Well  look at it. There's so many Spanish  American  Hispanic characters in it  but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man.  Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston  so to me  it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters  but I understood what my critic was looking for. And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him. He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity. He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one. We often talk about how stories change the world  but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated  read and reviewed. Many authors feel this pressure  but non Western authors feel it more heavily. If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world  like me  then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and  preferably  the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women. You're expected to write informative  poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant garde to your Western colleagues. What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today. Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own  but as the representatives of their respective cultures  a few authors from China  a few from Turkey  a few from Nigeria. We're all thought to have something very distinctive  if not peculiar. The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in      in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality. When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer  Baldwin stopped and said   But don't you see  There's nothing in me that is not in everybody else  and nothing in everybody else that is not in me.  When identity politics tries to put labels on us  it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger. There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together. I never forget my first multicultural reading  in Harvard Square about    years ago. We were three writers  one from the Philippines  one Turkish and one Indonesian    like a joke  you know. And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste. It was only because of our passports. Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories  not so much the imaginary. A function is attributed to fiction. In this way  not only the writers themselves  but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger. But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West. It comes from everywhere. And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in      for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel. I had intended to write a constructive  multi layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women. My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted. Some people criticized  others praised me for writing about the Turkish Armenian conflict. But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction. It was just a story. And when I say   just a story   I'm not trying to belittle my work. I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is  not as a means to an end. Writers are entitled to their political opinions  and there are good political novels out there  but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics. Chekhov said   The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things. And only the latter is an artist's responsibility.  Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects. One is interested in sweeping generalizations. The other  in nuances. One draws boundaries. The other recognizes no frontiers. Identity politics is made of solid bricks. Fiction is flowing water. In the Ottoman times  there were itinerant storytellers called  meddah.  They would go to coffee houses  where they would tell a story in front of an audience  often improvising. With each new person in the story  the meddah would change his voice  impersonating that character. Everybody could go and listen  you know    ordinary people  even the sultan  Muslims and non Muslims. Stories cut across all boundaries  like  The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja   which were very popular throughout the Middle East  North Africa  the Balkans and Asia. Today  stories continue to transcend borders. When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk  they usually don't listen to each other  but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author  and vice versa  connecting and empathizing with the narrator. Literature has to take us beyond. If it cannot take us there  it is not good literature. Books have saved the introverted  timid child that I was    that I once was. But I'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them. When the poet and mystic  Rumi  met his spiritual companion  Shams of Tabriz  one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi's books into water and watch the letters dissolve. The Sufis say   Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance.  The problem with today's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge    we know a lot about each other  or so we think    but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves  it makes us elitist  distant and disconnected. There's a metaphor which I love  living like a drawing compass. As you know  one leg of the compass is static  rooted in a place. Meanwhile  the other leg draws a wide circle  constantly moving. Like that  my fiction as well. One part of it is rooted in Istanbul  with strong Turkish roots  but the other part travels the world  connecting to different cultures. In that sense  I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal  both from here and everywhere. Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace  which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than     years. In the palace  just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines  there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn. It's between buildings. I'm intrigued by this concept. We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things. We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn  who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness. But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most. When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability. I like not knowing what will happen    pages later. I like it when my characters surprise me. I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel  and perhaps it will be a very happy story  and in my next book  I might write about a handsome  gay professor in Norway. As long as it comes from our hearts  we can write about anything and everything. Audre Lorde once said   The white fathers taught us to say  'I think  therefore I am.'  She suggested   I feel  therefore I am free.  I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift. And yet  why is it that  in creative writing courses today  the very first thing we teach students is  write what you know   Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all. Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about. We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel. We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next. In the end  stories move like whirling dervishes  drawing circles beyond circles. They connect all humanity  regardless of identity politics  and that is the good news. And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem   Come  let us be friends for once  let us make life easy on us  let us be lovers and loved ones  the earth shall be left to no one.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Julian  welcome. It's been reported that WikiLeaks  your baby  has  in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined. Can that possibly be true  Julian Assange  Yeah  can it possibly be true  It's a worry    isn't it     that the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined. CA  How does it work  How do people release the documents  And how do you secure their privacy  JA  So these are    as far as we can tell    classical whistleblowers  and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us. So we use this state of the art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet  to hide trails  pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections. We get information in the mail  the regular postal mail  encrypted or not  vet it like a regular news organization  format it    which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do  when you're talking about giant databases of information    release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks. CA  So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate  but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is  JA  That's right  yeah. Very rarely do we ever know  and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible. CA  I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership. So let's take  an  example  actually. This is something you leaked a few years ago. If we can have this document up ... So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago. Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened  JA  So this is the Kroll Report. This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in     . Prior to       Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about    years. He was a soft dictator of Kenya. And when Kibaki got into power    through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya    they commissioned this report  spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report. And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi  who was the richest man    still is the richest man    in Kenya. It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism. So I went there in       and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election    the national election  December   . When we released that report  we did so three days after the new president  Kibaki  had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out  Daniel arap Moi  so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck. CA  And    I mean  to cut a long story short    word of the report leaked into Kenya  not from the official media  but indirectly  and in your opinion  it actually shifted the election. JA  Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya  in Tanzanian and South African press. And so it came in from the outside. And that  after a couple of days  made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it. And it ran for    nights straight on Kenyan TV  shifted the vote by    percent  according to a Kenyan intelligence report  which changed the result of the election. CA  Wow  so your leak really substantially changed the world  JA  Yep. CA  Here's    We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video. The video itself is longer  but here's a short clip. This is    this is intense material  I should warn you. Radio  ... just fuckin'  once you get on 'em just open 'em up. I see your element  uh  got about four Humvees  uh  out along ... You're clear. All right. Firing. Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot. Light 'em all up. C'mon  fire  Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. Hotel ... Bushmaster Two Six  Bushmaster Two Six  we need to move  time now  All right  we just engaged all eight individuals. Yeah  we see two birds  helicopters   and we're still firing. Roger. I got 'em. Two Six  this is Two Six  we're mobile. Oops  I'm sorry. What was going on  God damn it  Kyle. All right  hahaha. I hit 'em. CA  So  what was the impact of that  JA  The impact on the people who worked on it was severe. We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story. So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene. CA  So  I mean     people died in that attack  right  including two Reuters employees  JA  Yeah. Two Reuters employees  two young children were wounded. There were between    and    people killed all together. CA  And releasing this caused widespread outrage. What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage  do you think  JA  I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force. You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street  and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing    millimeter cannon shells on everyone    looking for any excuse to do so    and killing people rescuing the wounded. And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full time job. CA  I mean  there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst  Bradley Manning  arrested  and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you  along with         classified U.S. embassy cables. I mean  did he  JA  We have denied receiving those cables. He has been charged  about five days ago  with obtaining         cables and releasing   . Now  we had released  early in the year  a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy  but this is not necessarily connected. I mean  I was a known visitor of that embassy. CA  I mean  if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ... JA  We would have released them.  CA  You would   JA  Yeah.  CA  Because   JA  Well  because these sort of things reveal what the true state of  say  Arab governments are like  the true human rights abuses in those governments. If you look at declassified cables  that's the sort of material that's there. CA  So let's talk a little more broadly about this. I mean  in general  what's your philosophy  Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information  JA  Well  there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world  what sort of information can achieve reform. And there's a lot of information. So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing  that's a really good signal that when the information gets out  there's a hope of it doing some good    because the organizations that know it best  that know it from the inside out  are spending work to conceal it. And that's what we've found in practice  and that's what the history of journalism is. CA  But are there risks with that  either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large  where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence  JA  Not that we have seen with anything we have released. I mean  we have a harm immunization policy. We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal    personally identifying information in it. But there are legitimate secrets    you know  your records with your doctor  that's a legitimate secret    but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated. CA  So they are well motivated. And what would you say to  for example  the  you know  the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military  and he says   You know what  you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out. It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying. That gives the impression  has given the impression  to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people. Actually  they're not. My son isn't. How dare you   What would you say to that  JA  Yeah  we do get a lot of that. But remember  the people in Baghdad  the people in Iraq  the people in Afghanistan    they don't need to see the video  they see it every day. So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception. That's what they see every day. It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all  and that's our hope. CA  So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government. Light is good. But do you see any irony in the fact that  in order for you to shine that light  you have to  yourself  create secrecy around your sources  JA  Not really. I mean  we don't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet. We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources. Should they come forward  that would be a tricky situation for us  but we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission  not to screw it up. CA  I'd actually be interested  just based on what we've heard so far    I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience. You know  there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian. You know  hero    people's hero    bringing this important light. Dangerous troublemaker. Who's got the hero view  Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view  JA  Oh  come on. There must be some. CA  It's a soft crowd  Julian  a soft crowd. We have to try better. Let's show them another example. Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked  but I think for TED you are. I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened  right  What is this  JA  So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day. So late last year    in November last year    there was a series of well blowouts in Albania  like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico  but not quite as big. And we got a report    a sort of engineering analysis into what happened    saying that  in fact  security guards from some rival  various competing oil firms had  in fact  parked trucks there and blown them up. And part of the Albanian government was in this  etc.  etc. And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it  so it was an extremely difficult document for us. We couldn't verify it because we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about. So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up. So under that basis  we put it out and said   Look  we're skeptical about this thing. We don't know  but what can we do  The material looks good  it feels right  but we just can't verify it.  And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it  wanting to track down the source    saying   Hey  we want to track down the source.  And we were like   Oh  tell us more. What document is it  precisely  you're talking about  Can you show that you had legal authority over that document  Is it really yours   So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID. Yeah. That's happened quite a lot though. This is like one of our methods of identifying  of verifying  what a material is  is to try and get these guys to write letters. CA  Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP  JA  Yeah  we have a lot  but I mean  at the moment  we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort. So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have. That's a problem. I mean  like any sort of growing startup organization  we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth  and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information. CA  So that's the key bottleneck  basically journalistic volunteers and or the funding of journalistic salaries  JA  Yep. Yeah  and trusted people. I mean  we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with  so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff  and then lower security cases. CA  So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this. And I think I read that as a kid you went to    different schools. Can that be right  JA  Well  my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult  so the combination between the two ... CA  I mean  a psychologist might say that's a recipe for breeding paranoia. JA  What  the movie business  CA  And you were also    I mean  you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on. JA  Well  I was a journalist. You know  I was a very young journalist activist at an early age. I wrote a magazine  was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager. So you have to be careful with hacker. I mean there's like    there's a method that can be deployed for various things. Unfortunately  at the moment  it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts. So this phrase is not  not as nice as it used to be. CA  Yeah  well  I certainly don't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account  but what about your core values  Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them  JA  I'm not sure about the incident. But the core values  well  capable  generous men do not create victims  they nurture victims. And that's something from my father and something from other capable  generous men that have been in my life. CA  Capable  generous men do not create victims  they nurture victims  JA  Yeah. And you know  I'm a combative person  so I'm not actually so big on the nurture  but some way    there is another way of nurturing victims  which is to police perpetrators of crime. And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time. CA  So just tell us  very quickly in the last minute  the story  what happened in Iceland  You basically published something there  ran into trouble with a bank  then the news service there was injuncted from running the story. Instead  they publicized your side. That made you very high profile in Iceland. What happened next  JA  Yeah  this is a great case  you know. Iceland went through this financial crisis. It was the hardest hit of any country in the world. Its banking sector was    times the GDP of the rest of the economy. Anyway  so we release this report in July last year. And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air  like out of a movie  injunction landed on the news desk  and the news reader was like   This has never happened before. What do we do   Well  we just show the website instead  for all that time  as a filler  and we became very famous in Iceland  went to Iceland and spoke about this issue. And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again  and as a result  working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts  we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press  with the strongest journalistic protections in the world  with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech. Iceland's a Nordic country  so  like Norway  it's able to tap into the system. And just a month ago  this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously. CA  Wow. Last question  Julian. When you think of the future then  do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control  more secrecy  or us watching Big Brother  or it's just all to be played for either way  JA  I'm not sure which way it's going to go. I mean  there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world    within the E.U.  between China and the United States. Which way is it going to go  It's hard to see. That's why it's a very interesting time to be in    because with just a little bit of effort  we can shift it one way or the other. CA  Well  it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion to say  Julian  be careful  and all power to you. JA  Thank you  Chris.  CA  Thank you.  In October       the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The   . Icons like Batman  Superman  Wonder Woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons Jabbar  Noora  Jami and their colleagues. It's a story of intercultural intersections  and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies  As fascism took over Europe in the     s  an unlikely reaction came out of North America. As Christian iconography got changed  and swastikas were created out of crucifixes  Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men in the United States and Canada  also going back to the Bible. Consider this  like the prophets  all the superheroes are missing parents. Superman's parents die on Krypton before the age of one. Bruce Wayne  who becomes Batman  loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City. Spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle. And all of them  just like the prophets who get their message from God through Gabriel  get their message from above. Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan when the spider descends from above and gives him his message through a bite. Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom when a big bat flies over his head  and he sees it as an omen to become Batman. Superman is not only sent to Earth from the heavens  or Krypton  but he's sent in a pod  much like Moses was on the Nile. And you hear the voice of his father  Jor El  saying to Earth   I have sent to you my only son.  These are clearly biblical archetypes  and the thinking behind that was to create positive  globally resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message. And it's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked. This is the kind of thinking that went into creating The   . The    references the    attributes of Allah in the Koran  things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about. It doesn't matter what your religion is  even if you're an atheist  you don't raise your kid telling him  you know   Make sure you lie three times a day.  Those are basic human values. And so the backstory of The    takes place in       which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it. All the books from Bait al Hikma library  the most famous library in its day  were thrown in the Tigris River  and the Tigris changes color with ink. It's a story passed on generation after generation. I rewrote that story  and in my version  the librarians find out that this is going to happen    and here's a side note  if you want a comic book to do well  make the librarians the hero. It always works well. So the librarians find out and they get together a special solution  a chemical solution called King's Water  that when mixed with    stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books. But the Mongols get there first. The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River. Some librarians escape  and over the course of days and weeks  they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization. Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of    stones each through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain  where they're safe for     years. But in       two important things happen. The first is the fall of Granada  the last Muslim enclave in Europe. The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India  but he gets lost. So    of the stones are smuggled onto the Nina  the Pinta and the Santa Maria and are spread in the New World. Thirty three go on the Silk Road to China  South Asia and Southeast Asia. And    are spread between Europe  the Middle East and Africa. And now it's       and there are    heroes from    different countries. Now it's very easy to assume that those books  because they were from a library called Bait al Hikma  were Muslim books  but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library  his name was al Ma'mun    he was Harun al Rashid's son. He had told his advisers   Get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic  and I will pay them its weight in gold.  After a while  his advisers complained. They said   Your Highness  the scholars are cheating. They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold.  To which he said   Let them be  because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them.  So the idea of an open architecture  an open knowledge  is not new to my neck of the desert. The concept centers on something called the Noor stones. Noor is Arabic for light. So these    stones  a few kind of rules in the game  Number one  you don't choose the stone  the stone chooses you. There's a King Arthur element to the storyline  okay. Number two  all of The     when they first get their stone  or their power  abuse it  they use it for self interest. And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone  you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers  okay. Number three  the    stones all have within them a mechanism that self updates. Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world. Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place. Some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today. I don't belong there. Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living  breathing document  and I captured that idea within these stones that self update. Now the main bad guy  Rughal  does not want these stones to update  so he's trying to get them to stop updating. He can't use the stones  but he can stop them. And by stopping them  he has more of a fascist agenda  where he gets some of The    to work for him    they're all wearing cookie cutter  same color uniforms They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are. And he controls them from the top down    whereas when they work for the other side  eventually  when they find out this is the wrong person  they've been manipulated  they actually  each one has a different  colorful kind of dress. And the last point about the    Noor stones is this. So The    work in teams of three. Why three  A couple of reasons. Number one  we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together  because the third person is temptation or the devil  right  I think that's there in all cultures  right  But this is not about religion  it's not about proselytizing. There's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the deepest crevices of intolerance  and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game. And so this is the way I dealt with it. They work in teams of three  two boys and a girl  two girls and a boy  three boys  three girls  no problem. And the Swiss psychoanalyst  Carl Jung  also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures  so I figure I'm covered. Well ... I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East  so you     Laughter  you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story. So here's some of the characters that we have. Mujiba  from Malaysia  her main power is she's able to answer any question. She's the Trivial Pursuit queen  if you want  but when she first gets her power  she starts going on game shows and making money. We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power. Now  Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer. So the    attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang  there's the powerful  the hegemonous  the strong  and there's also the kind  the generous. I'm like  are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong  I'm like  you know what  I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime  so ... We have Jami from Hungary  who first starts making weapons  He's the technology wiz. Musawwira from Ghana  Hadya from Pakistan  Jaleel from Iran who uses fire. And this is one of my favorites  Al Batina from Yemen. Al Batina is the hidden. So Al Batina is hidden  but she's a superhero. I came home to my wife and I said   I created a character after you.  My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots. And she said   Show me.  So I showed this. She said   That's not me.  I said   Look at the eyes. They're your eyes.  So I promised my investors this would not be another made in fifth world country production. This was going to be Superman  or it wasn't worth my time or their money. So from day one  the people involved in the project  bottom left is Fabian Nicieza  writer for X Men and Power Rangers. Next to him is Dan Panosian  one of the character creators for the modern day X Men. Top right is Stuart Moore  a writer for Iron Man. Next to him is John McCrea  who was an inker for Spiderman. And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline   Next Ramadan  the world will have new heroes   back in     . Now I went to Dubai  to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference  and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist. Didn't have a product  but had energy. And I found somebody from The New York Times  and I cornered him  and I pitched him. And I think I scared him     Laughter  because he basically promised me    we had no product    but he said   We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you'll just go away.  So I said   Great.  So I called him up a few weeks afterward. I said   Hi  Hesa.  And he said   Hi.  I said   Happy New Year.  He said   Thank you. We had a baby.  I said   Congratulations.  Like I care  right   So when's the article coming out   He said   Naif  Islam and cartoon  That's not timely. You know  maybe next week  next month  next year  but  you know  it'll come out.  So a few days after that  what happens  What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy. I became timely. So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times. Next thing you knew  there's a full page covering us positively  January   nd        which changed our lives forever  because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic  guess what they got  they got me. And The    were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world. And that led to all kinds of things  from being in curricula in universities and schools to    one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia  it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab    it looked like a school. The good news is they're all holding copies of The     smiling  and they found me to sign the picture. The bad news is they were all photocopies  so we didn't make a dime in revenue. We've been able to license The    comic books into eight languages so far    Chinese  Indonesian  Hindi  Urdu  Turkish. Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago called The    Village Theme Park            square feet     rides  all with our characters  a couple back to school licenses in Spain and Turkey. But the biggest thing we've done to date  which is just amazing  is that we've done a    episode animated series  which is done for global audiences  in fact  we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey  we know. It's  D CGI  which is going to be very high quality  written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben    and Spiderman and Star Wars  Clone Wars. In this clip I'm about to show you  which has never been seen in the public before  there is a struggle. Two of the characters  Jabbar  the one with the muscles  and Noora  the one that can use light  are actually wearing the cookie cutter fascist gray uniform because they're being manipulated. They don't know  OK  and they're trying to get another member of The    to join them. So there's a struggle within the team. So if we can get the lights ...   The      Jabbar  Dana  I can't see where to grab hold. I need more light. What's happening  Dana  There's too much darkness. Rughal  There must be something we can do. Man  I won't send any more commandos in until I know it's safe. Dr. Razem  It's time to go  Miklos. Miklos  Must download file contents. I can't forget auntie. Jabbar  Dana  I can't do this without you. Dana  But I can't help. Jabbar  You can  even if you don't believe in yourself right now. I believe in you. You are Noora the Light. Dana  No. I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything. Jabbar  Then what about the rest of us  Don't we deserve to be saved  Don't I  Now  tell me which way to go. Dana  That way. Alarm  Threat imminent. Jabbar  Aaaahhh  Miklos  Stay away from me. Jabbar  We're here to help you. Dr. Razem  Don't listen to them. Dana  Miklos  that man is not your friend. Miklos  No. He gave me access  and you want to reboot the  unclear . No more  unclear .   The      Thank you. So  The     is technology  it's entertainment  it's design. But that's only half the story. As the father of five sons  I worry about who they're going to be using as role models. I worry because all around me  even within my extended family  I see religion being manipulated. As a psychologist  I worry for the world in general  but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world. Now  I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State. I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program  and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership  only to end up being tortured by their heroes. And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is  but when it's done by your hero  that just breaks you in so many ways. I left Bellevue  went to business school and started this. Now  one of the things that I refer to when I    about the importance of this message    is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University  where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior  and I gave the students two articles  one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine. And I took away the name of the writer  the name of the  unclear     everything was gone except the facts. And the first one was about a group called The Party of God  who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal. Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately  okay. The second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn't related to her. And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place. The first one  they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate. The second one  they were actually split between Saudi and Afghanistan. What blew their mind was the first one took place in India  it was the party of a Hindu God. The second one took place in upstate New York. It was an Orthodox Jewish community. But what breaks my heart and what's alarming is that in those two interviews  the people around  who were interviewed as well  refer to that behavior as Talibanization. In other words  good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way. This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism. But what do the students in Kuwait say  They said it's us    and this is dangerous. It's dangerous when a group self identifies itself as extreme. This is one of my sons  Rayan  who's a Scooby Doo addict. You can tell by the glasses there. He actually called me a meddling kid the other day. But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him. Last summer when we were in our home in New York  he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working  and he came in   Baba  I want you to come with me. I want my toy.   Yes  Rayan  just go away.  He left his Scooby Doo in his house. I said   Go away. I'm working. I'm busy.  And what Rayan did then is he sat there  he tapped his foot on the floor  at three and a half  and he looked at me and he said   Baba  I want you to come with me to my office in my house. I have work to do.  Rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level. And with The     that is what we aim to do. You know  I think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas. And when I see pictures like this  of parents or uncles who think it's cute to have a little child holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something  the hope is by linking enough positive things to the Koran  that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they're proud there  to that. And I think    I think The    can and will achieve its mission. As an undergrad at Tufts University  we were giving away free falafel one day and  you know  it was Middle East Day or something. And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel  ate it and  you know  talked and left. And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was  behind us   free falafel.  You know. Or so we thought  until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor  pointed up to the sign and said   Who's falafel   True story. She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting. Just today  D.C. Comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover. On that cover you see Batman  Superman and a fully clothed Wonder Woman with our Saudi member of The     our Emirati member and our Libyan member. On April           President Barack Obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech    in which he reached out to the Muslim world    the most innovative was that The    reach back out to the Justice League of America. We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols  like the falafel  can be misunderstood because of baggage  and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others. In a world like that  they'll always be a job for Superman and The   . Thank you very much. Well  indeed  I'm very  very lucky. My talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months    seemingly unrelated  but as you will see  actually all having to do with the story I want to tell you today. The first one was actually a funeral    to be more precise  a reburial. On May   nd  there was a hero's reburial in Frombork  Poland of the   th century astronomer who actually changed the world. He did that  literally  by replacing the Earth with the Sun in the center of the Solar System  and then with this simple looking act  he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution  which many call the Copernican Revolution. Now that was  ironically  and very befittingly  the way we found his grave. As it was the custom of the time  Copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave  together with    others in that cathedral. DNA analysis  one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last     years that he started  was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair    obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. That match was unambiguous. The DNA matched  and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. Now  the connection between biology and DNA and life is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus because  even back then  his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask  if the Earth is just a planet  then what about planets around other stars  What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds  about life on other planets  In fact  I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time. And at the time  people actually answered that question positively   Yes.  But there was no evidence. And here begins     years of frustration  of unfulfilled dreams    the dreams of Galileo  Giordano Bruno  many others    which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time.  What is life  What is the origin of life  Are we alone   And that especially happened in the last    years  at the end of the   th century  when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology  understanding the code of life  DNA  all of that seemed to actually put us  not closer  but further apart from answering those basic questions. Now  the good news. A lot has happened in the last few years  and let's start with the planets. Let's start with the old Copernican question  Are there earths around other stars  And as we already heard  there is a way in which we are trying  and now able  to answer that question. It's a new telescope. Our team  befittingly I think  named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time  Johannes Kepler  and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out  find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy  and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there. The telescope is actually built similarly to the  well known to you  Hubble Space Telescope  except it does have an additional lens    a wide field lens  as you would call it as a photographer. And if  in the next couple of months  you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this  you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night  without any interruption  for the next four years. The way we do that  actually  is with a method  which we call the transit method. It's actually mini eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star. Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that  but if you have a million stars  you'll find enough planets. And as you see on this animation  what Kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star. We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. All the stars for Kepler are just points of light. But we learn a lot from that  not only that there is a planet there  but we also learn its size. How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is. We learn about its orbit  the period of its orbit and so on. So  what have we learned  Well  let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that I'm here to tell you today. What Kepler does is discover a lot of candidates  which we then follow up and find as planets  confirm as planets. It basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size. There are small planets  there are bigger planets  there are big planets  okay. So we count many  many such planets  and they have different sizes. We do that in our solar system. In fact  even back during the ancients  the Solar System in that sense would look on a diagram like this. There will be the smaller planets  and there will be the big planets  even back to the time of Epicurus and then of course Copernicus and his followers. Up until recently  that was the Solar System    four Earth like planets with small radius  smaller than about two times the size of the Earth    and that was of course Mercury  Venus  Mars  and of course the Earth  and then the two big  giant planets. Then the Copernican Revolution brought in telescopes  and of course three more planets were discovered. Now the total planet number in our solar system was nine. The small planets dominated  and there was a certain harmony to that  which actually Copernicus was very happy to note  and Kepler was one of the big proponents of. So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets. But up until  literally     years ago  that was all we knew about planets. And that's what the frustration was. The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. Finally     years ago  the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star  and we actually did pretty well. In the next    years  almost     planets were discovered orbiting other stars  with different methods. Unfortunately  as you can see  there was a very different picture. There was of course an explanation for it  We only see the big planets  so that's why most of those planets are really in the category of  like Jupiter.  But you see  we haven't gone very far. We were still back where Copernicus was. We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there. And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate  to emerge  to survive. And we didn't have the evidence for that. So today  I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope  Kepler  has been able to tell us in the last few weeks  and  lo and behold  we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus. You can see here  the small planets dominate the picture. The planets which are marked  like Earth    are  definitely more than any other planets that we see. And now for the first time  we can say that. There is a lot more work we need to do with this. Most of these are candidates. In the next few years we will confirm them. But the statistical result is loud and clear. And the statistical result is that planets like our own Earth are out there. Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. So the question is  what do we do next  Well  first of all  we can study them now that we know where they are. And we can find those that we would call habitable  meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on Earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen. So  we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own Milky Way Galaxy harbors. And the number  as you might expect  is pretty staggering. It's about     million such planets. That's great news. Why  Because with our own little telescope  just in the next two years  we'll be able to identify at least    of them. So that's great because then we can go and study them    remotely  of course    with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years. We can find what they're made of  would their atmospheres have water  carbon dioxide  methane. We know and expect that we'll see that. That's great  but that is not the whole news. That's not why I'm here. Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part. The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next. And here comes biology    biology  with its basic question  which still stands unanswered  which is essentially   If there is life on other planets  do we expect it to be like life on Earth   And let me immediately tell you here  when I say life  I don't mean  dolce vita   good life  human life. I really mean life on Earth  past and present  from microbes to us humans  in its rich molecular diversity  the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions    and we call that  collectively  biochemistry  life as a chemical process  as a chemical phenomenon. So the question is  is that chemical phenomenon universal  or is it something which depends on the planet  Is it like gravity  which is the same everywhere in the universe  or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them  We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that. And that's a very basic question  which we don't know the answer to  but which we can try    and we are trying    to answer in the lab. We don't need to go to space to answer that question. And so  that's what we are trying to do. And that's what many people now are trying to do. And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well. So this is one example that I want to show you here. When we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life  we think of compartmentalization  keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane  isolated from the rest of the environment  but yet  in an environment in which they actually could originate together. And in one of our labs  Jack Szostak's labs  it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments    which are very common on planets  on certain types of planets like the Earth  where you have some liquid water and some clays    you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. But those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on Earth looks like  like this. And they really help molecules  like nucleic acids  like RNA and DNA  stay inside  develop  change  divide and do some of the processes that we call life. Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon. And in a sense  you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge  building a bridge from two sides of the river. On one hand  on the left bank of the river  are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments. We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities  and there is not too much lab  and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments. So that's what we are building from the left side of the river. From the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you  where we actually tried that  and it feeds back and forth  and we hope to meet in the middle one day. So why should you care about that  Why am I trying to sell you a half built bridge  Am I that charming  Well  there are many reasons  and you heard some of them in the short talk today. This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives. But there is something more profound here  something deeper. And that deeper  underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it. And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way    not in a dissimilar way as     years ago  Copernicus' act did  by changing the way we view space and time. Now it's about something else  but it's equally profound. And half the time  what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind  to the Earth in a bigger space. And the more we learn  the more that was reinforced. You've all learned that in school    how small the Earth is compared to the immense universe. And the bigger the telescope  the bigger that universe becomes. And look at this image of the tiny  blue dot. This pixel is the Earth. It is the Earth as we know it. It is seen from  in this case  from outside the orbit of Saturn. But it's really tiny. We know that. Let's think of life as that entire planet because  in a sense  it is. The biosphere is the size of the Earth. Life on Earth is the size of the Earth. And let's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms. What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong  Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today  Let's actually try that. So in space  the Earth is very small. Can you imagine how small it is  Let me try it. Okay  let's say this is the size of the observable universe  with all the galaxies  with all the stars  okay  from here to here. Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be  It will be the size of a single  small atom. It is unimaginably small. We can't imagine it. I mean look  you can see the necktie  but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little  small atom. But that's not the whole story  you see. The universe and life are both in space and time. If that was the age of the universe  then this is the age of life on Earth. Think about those oldest living things on Earth  but in a cosmic proportion. This is not insignificant. This is very significant. So life might be insignificant in size  but it is not insignificant in time. Life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent  parent and offspring. So what does this tell us  This tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the Copernican principle  it's all wrong. There is immense  powerful potential in life in this universe    especially now that we know that places like the Earth are common. And that potential  that powerful potential  is also our potential  of you and me. And if we are to be stewards of our planet Earth and its biosphere  we'd better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it. And the good news is we can actually  indeed do it. And let's do it. Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one  with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future. And let's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle. Thank you very much. Up until now  our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms. Whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch  or even as complex as programming robotics  we have always had to give a command to a machine  or even a series of commands  in order for it to do something for us. Communication between people  on the other hand  is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed. We observe facial expressions  body language  and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another. This actually forms a large part of our decision making process. Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do  but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences. And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain  our center for control and experience. Well  it sounds like a pretty good idea  but this task  as Bruno mentioned  isn't an easy one for two main reasons  First  the detection algorithms. Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons  around         km of combined axon length. When these neurons interact  the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse  which can be measured. The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain  and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity  the brain surface is highly folded. Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses. Each individual's cortex is folded differently  very much like a fingerprint. So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain  by the time the structure has been folded  its physical location is very different between individuals  even identical twins. There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals. Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex  so that we can map the signals closer to its source  and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population. The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves. EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors  like the one that you can see here in the photo. A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion. Now this is quite time consuming and isn't the most comfortable process. And on top of that  these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. So with that  I'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant  who is one of last year's speakers  who's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we've been able to develop. So the device that you see is a    channel  high fidelity EEG acquisition system. It doesn't require any scalp preparation  no conductive gel or paste. It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle. It's also wireless  so it gives you the freedom to move around. And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system  this headset only costs a few hundred dollars. Now on to the detection algorithms. So facial expressions    as I mentioned before in emotional experiences    are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization. But with the limited time we have available  I'd like to show you the cognitive suite  which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind. Now  Evan is new to this system  so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him. He's obviously not Joanne    so we'll  add user.  Evan. Okay. So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal. With neutral  there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do. He just hangs out. He's relaxed. And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain  because every brain is different. It takes eight seconds to do this  and now that that's done  we can choose a movement based action. So Evan  choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind. Evan Grant  Let's do  pull.  Tan Le  Okay  so let's choose  pull.  So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen  and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that. The first time  nothing will happen  because the system has no idea how he thinks about  pull.  But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds. So  one  two  three  go. Okay. So once we accept this  the cube is live. So let's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling. Ah  good job  That's really amazing. So we have a little bit of time available  so I'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task. And this one is difficult because it's all about being able to visualize something that doesn't exist in our physical world. This is  disappear.  So what you want to do    at least with movement based actions  we do that all the time  so you can visualize it. But with  disappear   there's really no analogies    so Evan  what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out  okay. Same sort of drill. So  one  two  three  go. Okay. Let's try that. Oh  my goodness. He's just too good. Let's try that again. EG  Losing concentration. TL  But we can see that it actually works  even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time. As I said  it's a very difficult process to imagine this. And the great thing about it is that we've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about  disappear.  As there is a machine learning algorithm in this    Thank you. Good job. Good job. Thank you  Evan  you're a wonderful  wonderful example of the technology. So  as you can see  before  there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan  or any user  becomes more familiar with the system  they can continue to add more and more detections  so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts. And once you've trained up the detections  these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform  application or device. So I'd like to show you a few examples  because there are many possible applications for this new interface. In games and virtual worlds  for example  your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character. Obviously  you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind. And also  colors  lighting  sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you're having  in real time. And moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world  with robots and simple machines  for example    in this case  flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking  lift  with your mind. The technology can also be applied to real world applications    in this example  a smart home. You know  from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains. And of course  also to the lighting    turning them on or off. And finally  to real life changing applications  such as being able to control an electric wheelchair. In this example  facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands. Man  Now blink right to go right. Now blink left to turn back left. Now smile to go straight. TL  We really    Thank you. We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today  and with the community's input  and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world  we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here. Thank you so much. So let me just start with my story. So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college. Then I went on to tear my ACL  the ligament in my knee  and then developed an arthritic knee. And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story  and  by the way  I married a woman who has exactly the same story. So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me. So with that  let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain. Narrator  We are all aware of the risk of cancer  but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us  arthritis. Cancer may kill you  but when you look at the numbers  arthritis ruins more lives. Assuming you live a long life  there's a    percent chance you'll develop arthritis. And it's not just aging that causes arthritis. Common injuries can lead to decades of pain  until our joints quite literally grind to a halt. Desperate for a solution  we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts  but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body  shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better  more natural way  Let's consider an alternative path. What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature  or within our own stem cells  This is the field of biologic replacements  where we replace worn out parts with new  natural ones. Kevin Stone  And so  the mission is  how do I treat these things biologically  And let's talk about both what I did for my wife  and what I've done for hundreds of other patients. First thing for my wife  and the most common thing I hear from my patients  particularly in the     to    year old age group     year old age group  is they come in and say   Hey  Doc  isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee  I'm not ready for joint replacement.  And so for her  I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that  knee  joint space. And  the allograft  replaces  the missing meniscus . And then for that unstable ligament  we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee. And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface  we did a stem cell paste graft  which we designed in       to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there. So here's my wife's bad knee on the left  and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen  and doing well. And it works  not just for my wife  but certainly for other patients. The girl on the video  Jen Hudak  just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee  as you see in the other image    and having a paste graft to that knee. And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically. So with all this success  why isn't that good enough  you might ask. Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles. There's not enough young  healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us. And the tissue's very expensive. And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue. But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful  it's cheap  you can get it from young  healthy tissues  but the barrier is immunology. And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl  or gal epitope. So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people  we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope. So my story in working with animal tissues starts in     . And I started first with cow Achilles tendon  where we would take the cow Achilles tendon  which is type I collagen  strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template. We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee. We've now done that procedure  and it's been done worldwide in over       cases  so it's an FDA approved and worldwide accepted way to regrow the meniscus. And that's great when I can degrade the tissue. But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament  I can't grind it up in a blender. So in that case  I have to design    and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek    an enzyme wash to wash away  or strip  those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme. And we call that a  gal stripping  technique. What we do is humanize the tissue. It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it  Laughter   and then we can put it back into a patient's knee. And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament    young  healthy  big tissue  put it into    patients in an FDA approved trial    and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships    on his  pig lig   as he calls it. So we know it can work. And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending. So what about the next step  What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement  not just the parts  How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement  Well here's how we're going to do it. So what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young  healthy pig  strip it of its antigens  load it with your stem cells  then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee  tack it on there  have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee. So that's our biologic approach right now. We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts. We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface. But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom. There's a benefit of     million years of ambulation. We can harness those benefits. We can use thicker  younger  better tissues than you might have injured in your knee  or that you might have when you're        or   . We can do it as an outpatient procedure. We can strip that tissue very economically  and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global. And so welcome to super biologics. It's not hardware. It's not software. It's bioware. It's version  .  of you. And so with that  coming to a    coming to an operating theater near you soon  I believe. Thank you very much. Today  I'm going to take you around the world in    minutes. My base of operations is in the U.S.  but let's start at the other end of the map  in Kyoto  Japan  where I was living with a Japanese family while I was doing part of my dissertational research    years ago. I knew even then that I would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings  but they popped up when I least expected it. On my first day  I went to a restaurant  and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar. After a pause  the waiter said   One does not put sugar in green tea.   I know   I said.  I'm aware of this custom. But I really like my tea sweet.  In response  he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation.  One does not put sugar in green tea.   I understand   I said   that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea  but I'd like to put some sugar in my green tea.  Surprised by my insistence  the waiter took up the issue with the manager. Pretty soon  a lengthy discussion ensued  and finally the manager came over to me and said   I am very sorry. We do not have sugar.  Well  since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it  I ordered a cup of coffee  which the waiter brought over promptly. Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar. My failure to procure myself a cup of sweet  green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding. This was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice. From my American perspective  when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences  she has every right to have that request met. The American way  to quote Burger King  is to  have it your way   because  as Starbucks says   happiness is in your choices.  But from the Japanese perspective  it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better    in this case  the ignorant gaijin    from making the wrong choice. Let's face it  the way I wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards  and they were doing their best to help me save face. Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice. They think that choice  as seen through the American lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans. Unfortunately  these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries  in many cultures. At times they don't even hold true at America's own borders. I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them. As I do so  I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds. First assumption  if a choice affects you  then you should be the one to make it. This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for. It is essential for success. In America  the primary locus of choice is the individual. People must choose for themselves  sometimes sticking to their guns  regardless of what other people want or recommend. It's called  being true to yourself.  But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice  Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question. In one study  which we ran in Japantown  San Francisco  we brought seven  to nine year old Anglo  and Asian American children into the laboratory  and we divided them up into three groups. The first group came in  and they were greeted by Miss Smith  who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles. The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do  and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with. When the second group of children came in  they were brought to the same room  shown the same anagrams  but this time Miss Smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with. Now when the third group came in  they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers. In reality  the kids who were told what to do  whether by Miss Smith or their mothers  were actually given the very same activity  which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen. With this procedure  we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity  making it easier for us to compare performance. Such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed. Anglo Americans  they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them  as compared to when it was chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers. It didn't matter who did the choosing  if the task was dictated by another  their performance suffered. In fact  some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted. One girl named Mary said   You asked my mother   In contrast  Asian American children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice  second best when they chose for themselves  and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith. A girl named Natsumi even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked   Could you please tell my mommy I did it just like she said   The first generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice. For them  choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality  but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected. If they had a concept of being true to one's self  then that self  most likely   was  composed  not of an individual  but of a collective. Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences. Or  you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others. The assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others. When  in contrast  two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected  then they may amplify one another's success by turning choosing into a collective act. To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships. Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands. It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility. It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self defining act. People that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating  but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone. The second assumption which informs the American view of choice goes something like this. The more choices you have  the more likely you are to make the best choice. So bring it on  Walmart  with         different products  and Amazon  with    million books and Match.com with    what is it        million date possibilities now. You will surely find the perfect match. Let's test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe. Here  I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries  who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society. One of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question  but from a simple gesture of hospitality. When the participants arrived for their interview  I offered them a set of drinks  Coke  Diet Coke  Sprite    seven  to be exact. During the very first session  which was run in Russia  one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard.  Oh  but it doesn't matter. It's all just soda. That's just one choice.  I was so struck by this comment that from then on  I started to offer all the participants those seven sodas  and I asked them   How many choices are these   Again and again  they perceived these seven different sodas  not as seven choices  but as one choice  soda or no soda. When I put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas  now they perceived it as only three choices    juice  water and soda. Compare this to the die hard devotion of many Americans  not just to a particular flavor of soda  but to a particular brand. You know  research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. Of course  you and I know that Coke is the better choice. For modern Americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world  choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is. Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better  and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters. But for Eastern Europeans  the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge. They were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim. When asked   What words and images do you associate with choice   Grzegorz from Warsaw said   Ah  for me it is fear. There are some dilemmas you see. I am used to no choice.  Bohdan from Kiev said  in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace   It is too much. We do not need everything that is there.  A sociologist from the Warsaw Survey Agency explained   The older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them. They were never given a chance to learn how to react.  And Tomasz  a young Polish man said   I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum. I don't mean to say that I want no choice  but many of these choices are quite artificial.  In reality  many choices are between things that are not that much different. The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options. Americans train their whole lives to play  spot the difference.  They practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability. In fact  though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice  we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent. When someone can't see how one choice is unlike another  or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast  the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating. Instead of making better choices  we become overwhelmed by choice  sometimes even afraid of it. Choice no longer offers opportunities  but imposes constraints. It's not a marker of liberation  but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae. In other words  choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in America when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it. But it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever increasing choice. Americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice. We all have physical  mental and emotional  Laughter  limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter  even in the grocery store  let alone over the course of our entire lives. A number of my studies have shown that when you give people    or more options when they're making a choice  they make poorer decisions  whether it be health care  investment  other critical areas. Yet still  many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them. This brings me to the third  and perhaps most problematic  assumption   You must never say no to choice.  To examine this  let's go back to the U.S. and then hop across the pond to France. Right outside Chicago  a young couple  Susan and Daniel Mitchell  were about to have their first baby. They'd already picked out a name for her  Barbara  after her grandmother. One night  when Susan was seven months pregnant  she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room. The baby was delivered through a C section  but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia  a loss of oxygen to the brain. Unable to breathe on her own  she was put on a ventilator. Two days later  the doctors gave the Mitchells a choice  They could either remove Barbara off the life support  in which case she would die within a matter of hours  or they could keep her on life support  in which case she might still die within a matter of days. If she survived  she would remain in a permanent vegetative state  never able to walk  talk or interact with others. What do they do  What do any parent do  In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali  American and French parents were interviewed. They had all suffered the same tragedy. In all cases  the life support was removed  and the infants had died. But there was a big difference. In France  the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed  while in the United States  the final decision rested with the parents. We wondered  does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one  We found that it did. Even up to a year later  American parents were more likely to express negative emotions  as compared to their French counterparts. French parents were more likely to say things like   Noah was here for so little time  but he taught us so much. He gave us a new perspective on life.  American parents were more likely to say things like   What if  What if   Another parent complained   I feel as if they purposefully tortured me. How did they get me to do that   And another parent said   I feel as if I've played a role in an execution.  But when the American parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision  they all said   No.  They could not imagine turning that choice over to another  even though having made that choice made them feel trapped  guilty  angry. In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed. These parents could not contemplate giving up the choice  because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice. In her essay   The White Album   Joan Didion writes   We tell ourselves stories in order to live. We interpret what we see  select the most workable of the multiple choices. We live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images  by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria  which is our actual experience.  The story Americans tell  the story upon which the American dream depends  is the story of limitless choice. This narrative promises so much  freedom  happiness  success. It lays the world at your feet and says   You can have anything  everything.  It's a great story  and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it. But when you take a close look  you start to see the holes  and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways. Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice  believing that they will be  or ought to be  welcomed with open hearts and minds. But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way. The phantasmagoria  the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative  varies from place to place. No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere. Moreover  Americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative  which has been driving their choices for so long. Robert Frost once said that   It is poetry that is lost in translation.  This suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving  whatever gives us a new way to see  cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language. But Joseph Brodsky said that   It is poetry that is gained in translation   suggesting that translation can be a creative  transformative act. When it comes to choice  we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives. Instead of replacing one story with another  we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written. No matter where we're from and what your narrative is  we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do  and what it can represent. And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism. Rather  it teaches us when and how to act. It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice  to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver. If we learn to speak to one another  albeit through translation  then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness  complexity and compelling beauty. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Sheena  there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book. But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind. And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is  How does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on  Sheena Iyengar  Well  it's funny that you should ask that because one of the things that's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices. And as you just mentioned  there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days. Yeah  I    as you would expect    get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because I have to rely on what other people suggest. And I can't decide. And so one time I was in a beauty salon  and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink. And one was called  Ballet Slippers.  And the other one was called  Adorable.  And so I asked these two ladies  and the one lady told me   Well  you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'   Well  what does it look like    Well  it's a very elegant shade of pink.   Okay  great.  The other lady tells me to wear  Adorable.   What does it look like    It's a glamorous shade of pink.  And so I asked them   Well  how do I tell them apart  What's different about them   And they said   Well  one is elegant  the other one's glamorous.  Okay  we got that. And the only thing they had consensus on  well  if I could see them  I would clearly be able to tell them apart. And what I wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color  so I decided to do a little experiment. So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory  and I stripped the labels off. And I brought women into the laboratory  and I asked them   Which one would you pick      percent of the women accused me of playing a trick  of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles. At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on. Now  of the women that could tell them apart  when the labels were off  they picked  Adorable   and when the labels were on  they picked  Ballet Slippers.  So as far as I can tell  a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different. BG  Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena. For a moment  what I need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination. We're in   th century Japan on the west coast  and a little  wizened monk is hurrying along  near midnight  to the crest of a small hill. He arrives on the small hill  dripping with water. He stands there  and he looks across at the island  Sado. And he scans across the ocean  and he looks at the sky. Then he says to himself  very quietly    Turbulent the sea    Stretching across to Sado   The Milky Way .  Basho was a brilliant man. He said more with less than any human that I have ever read or talked to. Basho  in    syllables  juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past  and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars  probably hundreds and hundreds of    who knows how many    planets  maybe even an ocean that we will probably call Sylvia in time. As he was nearing his death  his disciples and followers kept asking him   What's the secret  How can you make haiku poems so beautiful so easily   And toward the end  he said   If you would know the pine tree  go to the pine tree.  That was it. Sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans. If we would know the oceans  we must go to the oceans. And what I'd like to talk to you today about  a little bit  is really transforming the relationship  or the interplay  between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet. I hope it will be. There are a few key points. One of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth. Another is that there are bold  new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. And the last is that these bold  new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet  our oceans  and eventually how we manage probably the entire planet  for what it's worth. So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system. They define what the system is. The system isn't Chesapeake Bay. It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific. It's the whole planet  the entire planet  continents and oceans together. That's the system. And basically  our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes  two sources of energy  one of which is solar  that drives the winds  the waves  the clouds  the storms and photosynthesis. The second one is internal energy. And these two war against one another almost continuously. Mountain ranges  plate tectonics  moves the continents around  forms ore deposits. Volcanoes erupt. That's the planet that we live on. It's immensely complex. Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here  but what I want you to see is this is about    percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously  and have for the last   billion years. This is a system that's been around a very long time. And these have all co evolved. What do I mean by that  They interact with one another constantly. All of them interact with one another. So the complexity of this system that we're looking at  the one driven by the sun    upper portion  mostly    and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes. This is very  very important because this is the system  this is the crucible  out of which life on the planet came  and it's now time for us to understand it. We must understand it. That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about  understand this ocean of ours  this basic life support system  the dominant life support system on the planet. Look at this complexity here. This is only one variable. If you can see the complexity  you can see how tiny  little eddies and large eddies and the motion    this is just sea surface temperature  but it's immensely complicated. Now a layer in  the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting  partly as a function of temperature  partly as a function of all the other factors  and you've got a really complicated system. That's our challenge  is to understand  understand this system in new and phenomenal ways. And there's an urgency to this. Part of the urgency comes from the fact that  of order  a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving. And part of the issue is for Cody    who's here     years old    and I have permission to relay this number. When he     years from now  is the age of Nancy Brown  there are going to be another two and a half billion people on the planet. We can't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans  but if we don't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now  then the stresses that we will face  and that Cody will face  and even Nancy  who's going to live till she's     will have really problems coping. All right  let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans. Look at this diagram  which is showing warm waters in red  cool waters in blue  and on the continents  what you're seeing in bright green  is the growth of vegetation  and in olive green  the dieback of vegetation. And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away from      to      and then cycling again. What you'll see is that the rhythms of growth  of vegetation    a subset of which is food on the continents    is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface temperatures. The oceans control  or at least significantly influence  correlate with  the growth patterns and the drought patterns and the rain patterns on the continents. So people in Kansas  in a wheat field in Kansas  need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well. Another complexity  this is the age of the oceans. I'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates. The age of the ocean  the tectonic plates  gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference. And I share with you some very high definition video that we collected in real time. Seconds after this video was taken  people in Beijing  people in Sydney  people in Amsterdam  people in Washington D.C. were watching this. Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents  but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor  there is vast reservoir of microbial activity  which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study. Some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet. It's an astonishing insight  and we have only found out about this recently. This is very  very exciting. It may be the next rainforest  in terms of pharmaceuticals. We know little or nothing about it. Well  Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying that   The real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory  but possibly in having new sets of eyes   new ways of seeing things  a new mindset. And many of you remember the early stages of oceanography  when we had to use what we had at our fingertips. And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days. Some of you remember this  I'm sure. And now  we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty powerful    ships  satellites  moorings. But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need. And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here  was funded  and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image. Modeling  on the right hand side  there's a very complex computational model. On the left hand side  there's a new type of mooring  which I'll show you in just a second. And on the basis of several points  the oceans are complex  and they're central to the life on earth. They are changing rapidly  but not predictably. And the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them. The computational power is amazing. But without data  those models will never ever be predicted. And that's what we really need. For a variety of reasons they're dangerous  but we feel that OOI  this Ocean Observatory Initiative  which the National Science Foundation has begun to fund  has the potential to really transform things. And the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins  utilizing widely accessible  interactive telepresence. It's a new world. We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean  at will  communicating in real time. And this is what the system involves  a number of sites in the southern hemisphere  shown in those circles. And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites. I won't talk a lot about most of them right here  but the one on the west coast  that's in the box  is called the regional scale nodes. It was once called Neptune. And let me show you what's behind it. Fiber  next generation way of communicating. You can see the copper tips on these things. You can transmit power  but the bandwidth is in those tiny  little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter. And this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second. This is phenomenal bandwidth. And this is what the planet looks like. We are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset  if you like. This is what it looks like. And the cables go really continent to continent. It's a very powerful system  and most of our communications consist of it. So this is the system that I'm talking about  off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate  the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. And it's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume    in the overlying ocean  on the sea floor and below the sea floor. Bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating. This is what one of those primary nodes looks like  and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle. And the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table. They will bring it and link it in. It'll be  in a sense  like having time on a telescope  except you'll have your own port. Climate change  ocean acidification  dissolved oxygen  carbon cycle  coastal upwelling  fishing dynamics    the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume. So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place. And this is just the first of these. In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues  we've set this up. Now I want to take you into the caldera. On the left hand side there is a large volcano called Axial Seamount. And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation. Here's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point. Very powerful. That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down  but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it. Or they can transfer control to someone in India or China who can take over for a while  because it's all going to be directly connected through the Internet. There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore  all available to anyone who has any interest in using it. This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location  then move to a new location. We're flying across the caldera floor. There is a number of robotic systems. There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will  if those are your experiments. The kinds of systems that will be down there  the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor  consist of    if you can read them there    there's cameras  there's pressure sensors  fluorometers  there's seismometers. It's a full spectrum of tools. Now  that mound right there actually looks like this. This is what it actually looks like. And this is the kind of activity that we can see with high definition video  because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to    stereo HD systems running continuously and  again  directed through robotic techniques from land. Very  very powerful. And these are the things that we're funded to do today. So what can we actually do tomorrow  We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity. There are emerging technologies throughout the field around oceanography  which we will incorporate into oceanography  and through that convergence  we will transform oceanography into something even more magical. Robotics systems are just incredible these days  absolutely incredible. And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts into the ocean. Nanotechnology  this is a small generator. It's smaller than a postage stamp  and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move. Just as you move  it generates power. There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean  continuously. Imaging  Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I  but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in HD will be routine within five years. And this is the magic one. As a result of the human genome process  we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean    like an erupting volcano  or something of that sort    can actually be sampled. We pump the fluid through one of these systems  and we press the button  and it's analyzed for the genomic character. And that's transmitted back to land immediately. So in the volume of the ocean  we will know  not just the physics and the chemistry  but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis. Grid computing  the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here. We will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything  like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data. The power generation will come from the ocean itself. And the next generation fiber will be simply magic. It's far beyond what we currently have. So the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented. So within five to seven years  I see us having a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean and have all of that connected to the Internet  so we can reach many  many folks. Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation. Here's an example. When earthquakes take place  massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor. We have a way of addressing that  a new way of addressing that. We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting  so we deploy the troops. What are the troops  The troops are the autonomous vehicles  of course. And they fly into the erupting volcano. They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption  which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before. They eject it to the surface where it floats  and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane  and it's brought back to the laboratory within    hours of the eruption. This is doable. All the pieces are there. A laboratory  many of you heard what happened on    . Some doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a woman in France. We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning  and it would be on live TV  if we have interesting things to show. So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world  throughout the ocean. This    I've shown you sea floor    but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth. It's going to be amazing. And as I go here  I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms  and indeed  what we can bring into your pocket. Many of you don't think of this yet  but the ocean will be in your pocket. It won't be long. It won't be long. So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet  if you'll forgive me. In       T.S. Eliot wrote the  Four Quartets.  He won the Nobel Prize for literature in     . In  Little Gidding  he says    speaking I think for the human race  but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia     We shall not cease from exploration  and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time  arrive through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning. At the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for  but heard  half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea.  Thank you. I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species. The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious  and that's that our species  Homo sapiens  is actually really  really smart    like  ridiculously smart    like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now. And this is  of course  not the first time you've probably recognized this. Of course  in addition to being smart  we're also an extremely vain species. So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart. You know  so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral. But of course  there's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more  and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart  sometimes uniquely smart  we can also be incredibly  incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making. Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there. Don't worry  I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes. But of course  just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude. And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face. We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create    these markets that were supposed to be foolproof    we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes. But both of these two embarrassing examples  I think  don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make  which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog worthy decisions. But it turns out  what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us  when put in certain contexts  will actually make very specific mistakes. The errors we make are actually predictable. We make them again and again. And they're actually immune to lots of evidence. When we get negative feedback  we still  the next time we're face with a certain context  tend to make the same errors. And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature. What I'm most curious about is  how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time  You know  we're the smartest thing out there  why can't we figure this out  In some sense  where do our mistakes really come from  And having thought about this a little bit  I see a couple different possibilities. One possibility is  in some sense  it's not really our fault. Because we're a smart species  we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super  super complicated  sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand  even though we've actually created them. We create financial markets that are super complex. We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with. And of course  if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it  in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up. If this was the case  we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error. We'd actually just say  okay  let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with  the kinds of environments that are bad    get rid of those  design things better  and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be. But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying  which is  maybe it's not our environments that are messed up. Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly. This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors. And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way  over and over again. It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways. This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about  because  if it's us that's messed up  it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it. We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it. So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at. How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two  What we need is a population that's basically smart  can make lots of decisions  but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have  any of the things that might mess us up    no human technology  human culture  maybe even not human language. And so this is why we turned to these guys here. These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey. These guys are New World primates  which means they broke off from the human branch about    million years ago. This means that your great  great  great great  great  great    with about five million  greats  in there    grandmother was probably the same great  great  great  great grandmother with five million  greats  in there as Holly up here. You know  so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant  but albeit evolutionary  relative. The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do. You know  she's a smart  very cut creature  a primate as well  but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up. So she's the perfect test case. What if we put Holly into the same context as humans  Does she make the same mistakes as us  Does she not learn from them  And so on. And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do. My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago. We said  all right  let's  you know  throw so problems at Holly  see if she messes these things up. First problem is just  well  where should we start  Because  you know  it's great for us  but bad for humans. We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts. You know  where are we actually going to start with this  And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse  around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news  we said  hhmm  maybe we should actually start in the financial domain. Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do. Of course  that's when we hit a sort second problem    a little bit more methodological    which is that  maybe you guys don't know  but monkeys don't actually use money. I know  you haven't met them. But this is why  you know  they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM    you know  they don't do this stuff. So now we faced  you know  a little bit of a problem here. How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it  So we said  well  maybe we should just  actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money. So that's just what we did. What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non human currency. We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies  so we just called it a token. But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans  to actually buy different pieces of food. It doesn't look like much    in fact  it isn't like much. Like most of our money  it's just a piece of metal. As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know  once you get home  it's actually pretty useless. It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it. When we first gave it to them in their enclosures  they actually kind of picked them up  looked at them. They were these kind of weird things. But very quickly  the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food. And so you see one of our monkeys  Mayday  up here doing this. This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things    doesn't know. There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter  and Mayday quickly figures out  apparently the human wants this. Hands it over  and then gets some food. It turns out not just Mayday  all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman. So here's just a quick video of what this looks like. Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food. Here's Felix  I think. He's our alpha male  he's a kind of big guy. But he too waits patiently  gets his food and goes on. So the monkeys get really good at this. They're surprisingly good at this with very little training. We just allowed them to pick this up on their own. The question is  is this anything like human money  Is this a market at all  or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something  looking smart  but not really being smart. And so we said  well  what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency  if they were really using it like money  Well  you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other. You might have them start paying attention to price  paying attention to how much they buy    sort of keeping track of their monkey token  as it were. Do the monkeys do anything like this  And so our monkey marketplace was born. The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure. When they get a hankering for some treats  we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market. Upon entering the market    it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because  as the monkeys entered the door of the market  a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here    two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from. The salesmen were students from my lab. They dressed differently  they were different people. And over time  they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn  you know  who sold what at what price    you know  who was reliable  who wasn't  and so on. And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little  yellow food dish. and that's what the monkey can for a single token. So everything costs one token  but as you can see  sometimes tokens buy more than others  sometimes more grapes than others. So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like. Here's a monkey eye view. Monkeys are shorter  so it's a little short. But here's Honey. She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently. All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice  one grapes or two grapes. You can see Honey  very good market economist  goes with the guy who gives more. She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two. So not just Honey  most of the monkeys went with guys who had more. Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food. When we introduced sales  we saw the monkeys paid attention to that. They really cared about their monkey token dollar. The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools  they basically matched  not just qualitatively  but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market. So much so that  if you saw the monkeys' numbers  you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market. And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that  at least for the monkeys and us  works like a real financial currency. Question is  do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do  Well  we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might. One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving    you know  just like our own species. The monkeys entered the market  spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else. The other thing we also spontaneously saw  embarrassingly enough  is spontaneous evidence of larceny. The monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity    from each other  often from us    you know  things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing  but things we spontaneously saw. So we said  this looks bad. Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do  One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out  you know  see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years. We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit. So we said  let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges  or certain kinds of economic experiments. And so  since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself  I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action. So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars    so    crisp hundred dollar bills. Take these  put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it. Because it's yours now  you can buy whatever you want. Donate it  take it  and so on. Sounds great  but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money. And here's your choice  you can either be risky  in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens. If it comes up heads  you're going to get a thousand dollars more. If it comes up tails  you get nothing. So it's a chance to get more  but it's pretty risky. Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure. I'm just going to give you     bucks. You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately. So see what your intuition is here. Most people actually go with the play it safe option. Most people say  why should I be risky when I can get       dollars for sure  This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that. You might say  eh  that's not really irrational. People are a little risk averse. So what  Well  the  so what   comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently. So now imagine that I give each and every one of you       dollars       crisp hundred dollar bills. Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before. Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet. And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time  it's a little bit worse. Now  you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money  but you're going to get the same choice. You can either take a risky loss    so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads  you're going to actually lose a lot. If it comes up tails  you lose nothing  you're fine  get to keep the whole thing    or you could play it safe  which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those      bills  for certain. And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there. So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this  which is when presented with these options  people don't choose to play it safe. They actually tend to go a little risky. The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice. It's a       shot of a thousand or        or just       dollars with certainty. But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with. So what's going on  Well  it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level. One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms. You really have to do work to figure out  well  one option's a thousand         one is      . Instead  we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another. So we think of things as   Oh  I'm going to get more   or  Oh  I'm going to get less.  This is all well and good  except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not. And this leads to the second bias  which economists have called loss aversion. The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red. We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money. And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this. What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss. That means when we're in a risk mindset    excuse me  when we're in a loss mindset  we actually become more risky  which can actually be really worrying. These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans. They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer    because they're evaluating them in relative terms. They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house    because they don't want to sell at a loss. The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases. If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market  would they do the same thing as people  And so this is what we did  we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe    they did the same thing every time    or guys who were risky    they did things differently half the time. And then we gave them options that were bonuses    like you guys did in the first scenario    so they actually have a chance more  or pieces where they were experiencing losses    they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got. And so this is what this looks like. We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen. The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape  so it looks pretty good. But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses. The guy on the left is a safe bonus. All the time  he adds one  to give the monkeys two. The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus. Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus    so this is a bonus of zero. Sometimes the monkeys get two extra. For a big bonus  now they get three. But this is the same choice you guys just faced. Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial  or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky  but big  bonus  but risk the possibility of getting no bonus. People here played it safe. Turns out  the monkeys play it safe too. Qualitatively and quantitatively  they choose exactly the same way as people  when tested in the same thing. You might say  well  maybe the monkeys just don't like risk. Maybe we should see how they do with losses. And so we ran a second version of this. Now  the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses  they're actually giving them less than they expect. So they look like they're starting out with a big amount. These are three grapes  the monkey's really psyched for this. But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect. They guy on the left is a safe loss. Every single time  he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two. the guy on the right is the risky loss. Sometimes he gives no loss  so the monkeys are really psyched  but sometimes he actually gives a big loss  taking away two to give the monkeys only one. And so what do the monkeys do  Again  same choice  they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time  or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three. The remarkable thing to us is that  when you give monkeys this choice  they do the same irrational thing that people do. They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started. This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains. So what does all of this mean  Well  what we've shown is that  first of all  we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency  and they do very similar things with it. They do some of the smart things we do  some of the kind of not so nice things we do  like steal it and so on. But they also do some of the irrational things we do. They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do. This is the first take home message of the Talk  which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought  oh  I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser. They're way cuter than the one at ... you know    Don't do that  they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have. So  you know  a little bad    Sorry  sorry  sorry. A little bad for monkey investors. But of course  you know  the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too. Because we've answered the question we started out with. We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from. And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions  tweak our technologies to make ourselves better. But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that. In fact  they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history. You know  maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey. Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back. And this  if we believe the capuchin monkey results  means that these duncey strategies might be    million years old. That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around    really  really old. What do we know about other old strategies like this  Well  one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome. You know  think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things  fatty things like cheesecake. You can't just shut that off. You can't just look at the dessert cart as say   No  no  no. That looks disgusting to me.  We're just built differently. We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after. My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions. When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red  when you're watching your house price go down  you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms. This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly  that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome. So that's the bad news. The question is  is there any good news  I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news. Well  the good news  I think  is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk  which is that humans are not only smart  we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom. We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations    you know  I flew over here in an airplane. I didn't have to try to flap my wings. I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you. I don't have to rely on my own near sightedness. We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means  seemingly pretty easily. But we have to recognize that we have those limitations. And here's the rub. It was Camus who once said that   Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is.  But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them. The hope is that you all will think about your limitations  not necessarily as unovercomable  but to recognize them  accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out. That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be. Thank you. Last year when I was here  I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole. And while that swim took place three years ago  I can remember it as if it was yesterday. I remember standing on the edge of the ice  about to dive into the water  and thinking to myself  I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening. The water is completely black. The water is minus  .  degrees centigrade  or    degrees Fahrenheit. It's flipping freezing in that water. And then a thought came across my mind  if things go pear shaped on this swim  how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean  And then I said to myself  I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up  listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy  and then committing myself a hundred percent    there is nothing more powerful than the made up mind    and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water. And that swim took me    minutes and    seconds  and it felt like    days. And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers  and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because    you know  we're made partially of water    when water freezes it expands  and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following  I'm never  ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again. Anyway  last year  I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the     Laughter  and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change. I heard about this lake  Lake Imja. This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier. The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake. And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great  big battleground on this earth. Nearly two billion people    so one in three people on this earth    rely on the water from the Himalayas. And with a population increasing as quickly as it is  and with the water supply from these glaciers    because of climate change    decreasing so much  I think we have a real risk of instability. North  you've got China  south  you've India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  all these countries. And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest  the highest mountain on this earth  and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest. Now  I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest  but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.    great  big  powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain    I don't just have my Speedo  but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world. The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude. I wanted to do the swim at       meters above sea level. So it's right up in the heavens. It's very  very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness. I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time. That's not the worst part of it. The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest. Many  many people have died on Mt. Everest  and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain. And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before  and  in fact  no fish    there are no fish up there swimming at       meters    When you're trying to do that  and then the bodies are coming past you  it humbles you  and you also realize very  very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are. And we walked up this pathway  all the way up. And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier. And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice. And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest  and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself  for this swim which was going to be so very difficult. I put on my iPod  I listened to some music  I got myself as aggressive as possible    but controlled aggression    and then I hurled myself into that water. I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters  and then I realized very  very quickly  I had a huge problem on my hands. I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air. I then began to choke  and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water. And it all happened so quickly  I then    I don't know how it happened    but I went underwater. And luckily  the water was quite shallow  and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air. And then I said  carry on. Carry on. Carry on. I carried on for another five or six strokes  and then I had nothing in my body  and I went down to the bottom of the lake. And I don't where I got it from  but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake. I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have. I have never  ever heard such utter bollocks. It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have. I got myself to the side of the lake. My crew grabbed me  and then we walked as quickly as we could down    over the rubble    down to our camp. And there  we sat down  and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest. And my team just gave it to me straight. They said  Lewis  you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim. Every single thing which you have learned in the past    years of swimming  you must forget. Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army  about speed and aggression  you put that to one side. We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time. Take some time to rest and think about things. We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time  and instead of swimming fast  swim as slowly as possible. Instead of swimming crawl  swim breaststroke. And remember  never ever swim with aggression. This is the time to swim with real humility. And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later. And I stood there on the edge of the lake  and I looked up at Mt. Everest    and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth    and I said to myself  just do this slowly. And I swam across the lake. And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side. But I learned two very  very important lessons there on Mt. Everest  and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this. The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well  doesn't mean it's going to work in the future. And similarly  now  before I do anything  I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task. And taking that into the world of climate change    which is  frankly  the Mt. Everest of all problems    just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long  just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long  doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on. The warning signs are all there. When I was born  the world's population was  .  billion people. We're now  .  billion people  and we're expected to be   billion people by     . And then the second lesson  the radical  tactical shift. And I've come here to ask you today  what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment  which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world  and most importantly  in a sustainable world  And I ask you  please  to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make  which will make that big difference  and then commit a hundred percent to doing it. Blog about it  tweet about it  talk about it  and commit a hundred percent  because very  very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it. So thank you very  very much. I grew up on a small farm in Missouri. We lived on less than a dollar a day for about    years. I got a scholarship  went to university  studied international agriculture  studied anthropology  and decided I was going to give back. I was going to work with small farmers. I was going to help alleviate poverty. I was going to work on international development  and then I took a turn and ended up here. Now  if you get a Ph.D.  and you decide not to teach  you don't always end up in a place like this. It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab. You could be in New York. What I found was  I started working with refugees and famine victims    small farmers  all  or nearly all    who had been dispossessed and displaced. Now  what I'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people. So I did it  I found out how many women had been raped en route to these camps. I found out how many people had been put in jail  how many family members had been killed. I assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them. And I got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps. Now this is God's work  but it's not my work. It's not the work I set out to do. So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests in     . I met a guy    the guy on the left. His name was Ben. He said   What can I do to save the rainforests   I said   Well  Ben  what do you do    I make ice cream.  So I said   Well  you've got to make a rainforest ice cream. And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as pasture.  He said   Okay.  Within a year  Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves. It was a great success. We did our first million dollars worth of trade by buying on    days and selling on   . That gets your adrenaline going. Then we had a four and a half million dollar line of credit because we were credit worthy at that point. We had    to     maybe    percent of the global Brazil nut market. We paid two to three times more than anybody else. Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise. A great success.    companies signed up      products came out  generated     million in sales. It failed. Why did it fail  Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts weren't the same people who were cutting the forests. And the people who made money from Brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests. We were attacking the wrong driver. We needed to be working on beef. We needed to be working on lumber. We needed to be working on soy    things that we were not focused on. So let's go back to Sudan. I often talk to refugees   Why was it that the West didn't realize that famines are caused by policies and politics  not by weather   And this farmer said to me  one day  something that was very profound. He said   You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep.  Okay. Fast forward. We live on a planet. There's just one of them. We've got to wake up to the fact that we don't have any more and that this is a finite planet. We know the limits of the resources we have. We may be able to use them differently. We may have some innovative  new ideas. But in general  this is what we've got. There's no more of it. There's a basic equation that we can't get away from. Population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet  and right now  it's a simple  not equal.  Our work shows that we're living at about  .  planets. Since       we crossed the line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet. Now we're at  . . If we were farmers  we'd be eating our seed. For bankers  we'd be living off the principal  not the interest. This is where we stand today. A lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem. It's always population growth. Population growth's important  but it's also about how much each person consumes. So when the average American consumes    times as much as the average African  we've got to think that consumption is an issue. It's not just about population  and it's not just about them  it's about us. But it's not just about people  it's about lifestyles. There's very good evidence    again  we don't necessarily have a peer reviewed methodology that's bulletproof yet    but there's very good evidence that the average cat in Europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average African. You think that's not an issue going forward  You think that's not a question as to how we should be using the Earth's resources  Let's go back and visit our equation. In       we had six billion people on the planet. They were consuming what they were consuming    let's say one unit of consumption each. We have six billion units of consumption. By       we're going to have nine billion people    all the scientists agree. They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do    scientists  again  agree    because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today    on global average  about   .  . So we're going to have    billion units of consumption. Who have you heard talking lately that's said we have to triple production of goods and services  But that's what the math says. We're not going to be able to do that. We can get productivity up. We can get efficiency up. But we've also got to get consumption down. We need to use less to make more. And then we need to use less again. And then we need to consume less. All of those things are part of that equation. But it basically raises a fundamental question  should consumers have a choice about sustainability  about sustainable products  Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable sitting next to one that isn't  or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable  If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet  how do you make that happen  The average consumer takes  .  seconds in the U.S. Okay  so let's be generous. Let's say it's  .  seconds in Europe. How do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product  the data that's changing on a weekly  if not a daily  basis  How do you get informed  You don't. Here's a little question. From a greenhouse gas perspective  is lamb produced in the U.K. better than lamb produced in New Zealand  frozen and shipped to the U.K.  Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef  Do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes  In every single case  the answer is  it depends.  It depends on who produced it and how  in every single instance. And there are many others. How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield  They're not. They may have a lot of opinions about it  but they're not going to be terribly informed. Sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue. It's got to be something we all care about. And we need collusion. We need groups to work together that never have. We need Cargill to work with Bunge. We need Coke to work with Pepsi. We need Oxford to work with Cambridge. We need Greenpeace to work with WWF. Everybody's got to work together    China and the U.S. We need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it  because it does  it fundamentally does. But we can't do everything. Even if we get everybody working on it  we've got to be strategic. We need to focus on the where  the what and the who. So  the where  We've identified    places globally that we need to work. These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point of view. We have to work in these places. We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it. We looked at the threats to these places. These are the    commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation  soil loss  water use  pesticide use  over fishing  etc. So we've got    places  we've got    priority commodities  who do we work with to change the way those commodities are produced  Are we going to work with  .  billion consumers  Let's see  that's about       languages      major languages    a lot of work there. I don't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively. Are we going to work with  .  billion producers  Again  a daunting task. There must be a better way.     to     companies control    percent or more of the trade of each of the    commodities that we've identified as the most significant. If we work with those  if we change those companies and the way they do business  then the rest will happen automatically. So  we went through our    commodities. This is nine of them. We lined them up side by side  and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those. And if you go through the first    or    names of each of the commodities  what you begin to see is  gosh  there's Cargill here  there's Cargill there  there's Cargill everywhere. In fact  these names start coming up over and over again. So we did the analysis again a slightly different way. We said  if we take the top hundred companies  what percentage of all    commodities do they touch  buy or sell  And what we found is it's    percent. So     companies control    percent of the trade of all    of the most significant commodities on the planet. We can get our arms around a hundred companies. A hundred companies  we can work with. Why is    percent important  Because if these companies demand sustainable products  they'll pull    to    percent of production. Companies can push producers faster than consumers can. By companies asking for this  we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it. After    years  the global organic movement has achieved  .  of one percent of global food. We can't wait that long. We don't have that kind of time. We need change that's going to accelerate. Even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there. We need to begin to work with industries. So we've started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain  from producers all the way to the retailers and brands. We bring in civil society  we bring in NGOs  we bring in researchers and scientists to have an informed discussion    sometimes a battle royale    to figure out what are the key impacts of these products  what is a global benchmark  what's an acceptable impact  and design standards around that. It's not all fun and games. In salmon aquaculture  we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago. Eight entities came to the table. We eventually got  I think     percent of global production at the table and    percent of demand at the table. Three of the original eight entities were suing each other. And yet  next week  we launch globally verified  vetted and certified standards for salmon aquaculture. It can happen. So what brings the different entities to the table  It's risk and demand. For the big companies  it's reputational risk  but more importantly  they don't care what the price of commodities is. If they don't have commodities  they don't have a business. They care about availability  so the big risk for them is not having product at all. For the producers  if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way  that's what brings them to the table. So it's the demand that brings them to the table. The good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago. In the last    months  we've signed agreements with    of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain. And in the next    months  we will have signed up to work with another     and we think we'll get those signed as well. Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs of these    companies together to help twist the arms of the final     to bring them to the table  because they don't like NGOs  they've never worked with NGOs  they're concerned about this  they're concerned about that  but we all need to be in this together. So we're pulling out all the stops. We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table. One company we're working with that's begun    in baby steps  perhaps    but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill. They've funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next    years  and do it all in Borneo alone by planting on land that's already degraded. The study shows that the highest net present value for palm oil is on land that's been degraded. They're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third party certified under a credible certification program. Why is Cargill important  Because Cargill has    to    percent of global palm oil. If Cargill makes a decision  the entire palm oil industry moves  or at least    or    percent of it. That's not insignificant. More importantly  Cargill and one other company ship    percent of the palm oil that goes to China. We don't have to change the way a single Chinese company works if we get Cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to China. It's a pre competitive issue. All the palm oil going there is good. Buy it. Mars is also on a similar journey. Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company  but Mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood. It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart because of pet food. But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate  and it all comes from the fact that Mars wants to be in business in the future. And what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production. On any given plantation     percent of the trees produce    percent of the crop  so Mars is looking at the genome  they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant. They're doing it with IBM and the USDA  and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data  because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable. What they've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance  they can produce     percent as much cocoa on    percent of the land. The rest of the land can be used for something else. It's more with less and less again. That's what the future has got to be  and putting it in the public domain is smart. They don't want to be an I.P. company  they want to be a chocolate company  but they want to be a chocolate company forever. Now  the price of food  many people complain about  but in fact  the price of food is going down  and that's odd because in fact  consumers are not paying for the true cost of food. If you take a look just at water  what we see is that  with four very common products  you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products  and then you look at how much water input was put into them  and then you look at what the farmer was paid. If you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid  the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities. That is an externality by definition. This is the subsidy from nature. Coca Cola  they've worked a lot on water  but right now  they're entering into    year contracts with growers in Turkey to sell juice into Europe  and they're doing that because they want to have a product that's closer to the European market. But they're not just buying the juice  they're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into Europe. There's carbon that's being bought with sugar  with coffee  with beef. This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity. We need to take what we've learned in private  voluntary standards of what the best producers in the world are doing and use that to inform government regulation  so we can shift the entire performance curve. We can't just focus on identifying the best  we've got to move the rest. The issue isn't what to think  it's how to think. These companies have begun to think differently. They're on a journey  there's no turning back. We're all on that same journey with them. We have to really begin to change the way we think about everything. Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine. Thank you. The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages. It  however  is enormous in both scale and importance. Look  you all are very well traveled  this is TEDGlobal after all. But I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before. So  let's start off in China. This photo was taken two weeks ago. Actually  one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school. But this is Tiananmen Square. Many of you have been there. It's not the real China. Let me take you to the real China. This is in the Dabian Mountains in the remote part of Hubei province in central China. Dai Manju is    years old at the time the story starts. She lives with her parents  her two brothers and her great aunt. They have a hut that has no electricity  no running water  no wristwatch  no bicycle. And they share this great splendor with a very large pig. Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said   We're going to pull you out of school because the    dollar school fees are too much for us. You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies. Why would we waste this money on you   This is what happens to girls in remote areas. Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade. She still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors. We wrote about her in The New York Times. We got a flood of donations    mostly    dollar checks because New York Times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then  we got a money transfer for            really nice guy. We turned the money over to that man there  the principal of the school. He was delighted. He thought   Oh  I can renovate the school. I can give scholarships to all the girls  you know  if they work hard and stay in school. So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school. She went to high school. She went to vocational school for accounting. She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south. She found a job  she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends. She sent money back to her family. They built a new house  this time with running water  electricity  a bicycle  no pig. What we saw was a natural experiment. It is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education. And over the years  as we followed Dai Manju  we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. She not only changed her own dynamic  she changed her household  she changed her family  her village. The village became a real standout. Of course  most of China was flourishing at the time  but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China. And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of  Half the Sky.  And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity. In the   th century  it was slavery. In the   th century  it was totalitarianism. The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender. So some of you may be thinking   Gosh  that's hyperbole. She's exaggerating.  Well  let me ask you this question. How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world  Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world  Hands up  please. How many of you think    a few    how many of you there are more females in the world  Okay  most of you. Well  you know this latter group  you're wrong. There are  true enough  in Europe and the West  when women and men have equal access to food and health care  there are more women  we live longer. But in most of the rest of the world  that's not the case. In fact  demographers have shown that there are anywhere between    million and     million missing females in the current population. And  you know  it happens for several reasons. For instance  in the last half century  more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the   th century. Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram. Girls get aborted before they're even born when there are scarce resources. This girl here  for instance  is in a feeding center in Ethiopia. The entire center was filled with girls like her. What's remarkable is that her brothers  in the same family  were totally fine. In India  in the first year of life  from zero to one  boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast  and the breast shows no son preference. From one to five  girls die at a    percent higher mortality rate than boys  in all of India. The second tenet of  Half the Sky  is that  let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all  and just on a purely practical level  we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and to bring women into the formal labor force. Poverty  for instance. There are three reasons why this is the case. For one  overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty. And you know  when you educate a boy  his family tends to have fewer kids  but only slightly. When you educate a girl  she tends to have significantly fewer kids. The second reason is it has to do with spending. It's kind of like the dirty  little secret of poverty  which is that  not only do poor people take in very little income  but also  the income that they take in  they don't spend it very wisely  and unfortunately  most of that spending is done by men. So research has shown  if you look at people who live under two dollars a day    one metric of poverty    two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here  in education.    percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol  tobacco  sugary drinks    and prostitution and festivals. If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket  you would have a transformative effect. The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution  not the problem. You need to use scarce resources. It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju. Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia. He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves. However  two thirds of the way there was a barrier. On this side was men  and then the barrier  and this side was women. And someone from this side of the room got up and said   Mr. Gates  we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia to be one of the top    countries when it comes to technology. Do you think we'll make it   So Bill Gates  as he was staring out at the audience  he said   If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country  there is no way you will get anywhere near the top   .  So here is Bill of Arabia. So what would some of the specific challenges look like  I would say  on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking. And I'll just say two things about this. The slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the     s  there were about        slaves transported from Africa to the New World. Now  modern slavery  according to State Department rough statistics  there are about               times the number    that are trafficked across international borders. And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders  which is a substantial portion. And if you look at another factor  another contrast  a slave back then is worth about         in today's money. Today  you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars  which means she's actually more disposable. But you know  there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand. We don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed. The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality. You know  childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event. In Niger  one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth. Around the world  one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth. You know  it's not as though we don't have the technological solution  but these women have three strikes against them  they are poor  they are rural and they are female. You know  for every woman who does die  there are    who survive but end up with an injury. And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula. It's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent. Let me tell you about Mahabuba. She lives in Ethiopia. She was married against her will at age   . She got pregnant  ran to the bush to have the baby  but you know  her body was very immature  and she ended up having obstructed labor. The baby died  and she ended up with a fistula. So that meant she was incontinent  she couldn't control her wastes. In a word  she stank. The villagers thought she was cursed  they didn't know what to do with her. So finally  they put her at the edge of the village in a hut. They ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night. That night  there was a stick in the hut. She fought off the hyenas with that stick. And the next morning  she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary  she would be saved. Because she had some damage to her nerves  she crawled all the way       miles    to that doorstep  half dead. The foreign missionary opened the door  knew exactly what had happened  took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa  and she was repaired with a     dollar operation. The doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor  she was really clever  and they made her a nurse. So now  Mahabuba  she is saving the lives of hundreds  thousands  of women. She has become part of the solution  not the problem. She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle. I've talked about some of the challenges  let me talk about some of the solutions  and there are predictable solutions. I've hinted at them  education and also economic opportunity. So of course  when you educate a girl  she tends to get married later on in life  she tends to have kids later on in life  she tends to have fewer kids  and those kids that she does have  she educates them in a more enlightened fashion. With economic opportunity  it can be transformative. Let me tell you about Saima. She lives in a small village outside Lahore  Pakistan. And at the time  she was miserable. She was beaten every single day by her husband  who was unemployed. He was kind of a gambler type    and unemployable  therefore    and took his frustrations out on her. Well  when she had her second daughter  her mother in law told her son   I think you'd better get a second wife. Saima's not going to produce you a son.  This is when she had her second daughter. At the time  there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a    dollar loan. Saima took that money  and she started an embroidery business. The merchants liked her embroidery  it sold very well  and they kept asking for more. And when she couldn't produce enough  she hired other women in the village. Pretty soon she had    women in the village working for her embroidery business. And then  when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace  she needed someone to help her do the transport  so she hired her husband. So now they're in it together. He does the transportation and distribution  and she does the production and sourcing. And now they have a third daughter  and the daughters  all of them  are being tutored in education because Saima knows what's really important. Which brings me to the final element  which is education. Larry Summers  when he was chief economist at the World Bank  once said that   It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls' education.  Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira. Beatrice was living in Uganda near the Congo border  and like Dai Manju  she didn't go to school. Actually  she had never been to school  not to a lick  one day. Her parents  again  said   Why should we spend the money on her  She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth.  Well  it just so happens  at that time  there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut. They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International. Heifer sent two goats to Africa. One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents  and that goat had twins. The twins started producing milk. They sold the milk for cash. The cash started accumulating  and pretty soon the parents said   You know  we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school.  So at nine years of age  Beatrice started in first grade    after all  she'd never been to a lick of school    with a six year old. No matter  she was just delighted to be in school. She rocketed to the top of her class. She stayed at the top of her class through elementary school  middle school  and then in high school  she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village  ever  to come to the United States on scholarship. Two years ago  she graduated from Connecticut College. On the day of her graduation  she said   I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat.  And that goat was     . So you see how transformative little bits of help can be. But I want to give you a reality check. Look  U.S. aid  helping people is not easy  and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid. There's Bill Easterly's book. There's a book called  Dead Aid.  You know  the criticism is fair  it isn't easy. You know  people say how half of all water well projects  a year later  are failed. When I was in Zimbabwe  we were touring a place with the village chief    he wanted to raise money for a secondary school    and there was some construction a few yards away  and I said   What's that   He sort of mumbled. Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project. A few yards away was a failed chicken coop. One year  all the chickens died  and no one wanted to put the chickens in there. It's true  but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater  you actually improve. You learn from your mistakes  and you continuously improve. We also think that individuals can make a difference  and they should  because individuals  together  we can all help create a movement. And a movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change  change that will address this great moral challenge. So then  I ask  what's in it for you  You're probably asking that. Why should you care  I will just leave you with two things. One is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of    which most of us  all of us  here in this room do    research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness. One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. And the second thing  it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with. And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur. Here was a woman who had worked in Darfur  seeing things that no human being should see. Throughout her time there  she was strong  she was steadfast. She never broke down. And then she came back to the United States and was on break  Christmas break. She was in her grandmother's backyard  and she saw something that made her break down in tears. What that was was a bird feeder. And she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted  where we not only can feed  clothe and house ourselves  but also provide for wild birds so they don't go hungry in the winter. And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility. And so  like her  you  me  we have all won the lottery of life. And so the question becomes  how do we discharge that responsibility  So  here's the cause. Join the movement. Feel happier and help save the world. Thank you very much. When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect    it was called Natal    I was inspired  and I thought for a moment  maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling  to create a character which seemed alive  which noticed me  that could look me in the eyes and feel real  and sculpt a story about our relationship. And so a year ago  I showed this off at a computer show called E . And this was a piece of technology with someone called Claire interacting with this boy. And there was a huge row online about   Hey  this can't be real.  And so I waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech. Now  this tech incorporates three big elements. The first is a Kinect camera  which will be out in November  some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults  collecting dust in Microsoft  plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead  mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea  to create a real  living being in a computer. Now  I'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick  but it's a trick that actually works. So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now. This is Dimitri. Dimitri  just waggle your arm around. Now  you notice he's sitting. There are no controllers  no keyboards  or mice  or joysticks  or joypads. He is just going to use his hand  his body and his voice  just like humans interact with their hands  body and voice. So let's move forward. You're going to meet Milo for the first time. We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo  we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat  to be honest with you. He was quite a know it all  and he wanted to kind of make you laugh. So the problem we introduced to him was this  he's just moved house. He's moved from London to New England  over in America. His parents are too busy to listen to his problems  and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up. So here he is walking through the grass. And you're able to interact with his world. The cool thing is  what we're doing is we're changing the mind of Milo constantly. That means no two people's Milos can be the same. You're actually sculpting a human being here. So  he's discovering the garden. You're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails. Very simple at the start. By the way  if you are a boy  it's snails  if you're a girl  it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails. So remember  this is the first time you've met him  and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious. His face  by the way  is fully AI driven. We have complete control over his blush responses  the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress. We actually do something called body matching. If you're leaning forward  he will try and slightly change the neuro linguistic nature of his face  because we went out with this strong idea  how can we make you believe that something's real  Now we've used the hand. The other thing to use is your body. Why not just  instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad  why not use your body just to lean on the chair    again  relaxed  You can lean back  but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking. So Dimitri's now going to use    he's used his hand  he's used his body. He's now going to use the other thing which is essential  and that's his voice. Now  the thing about voice is  our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful  isn't it  It never works. You order an airline ticket  you end up in Timbuktu. So we've tackled that problem  and we've come up with a solution  which we'll see in a second. Milo  I could just squish it. Peter Molyneux  What are you going to do  Dimitri  Female Voice  Squashing a snail may not seem important  but remember  even this choice will affect how Milo develops. Do you want Milo to squash it  When you see the microphone  say ...  PM  Squash.  ... yes to decide. Dimitri  Go on  Milo. Squash it. PM  No. That's the wrong thing to do. Now look at his response. He said   Go on  Milo. Squash it.  What we're using there is  we're using something  a piece of technology called Tellme. It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago. We've got a database of words which we recognize. We pick those words out. We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Dimitri's voice  or the user's voice. Now we need to have a bit more engagement  and again  what we can do is we can look at the body. And we'll do that in a second. Milo  I wonder how deep it is. Deep. PM  Okay. So what we're going to do now is teach Milo to skim stones. We're actually teaching him. It's very  very interesting that men  more than women  tend to be more competitive here. They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws  but then they want to beat Milo  where women  they're more nurturing about this. Okay  this is skimming stones. How do you skim stones  You stand up  and you skim the stone. It's that simple. Just recognizing your body  recognizing the body's motions  the tech  understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up. Again  all of this is done in the way us humans do things  and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real. Female Voice  See if you can inspire him to do any better. Try hitting the boat. Milo  Ahhh. So close. PM  That's Dimitri at his most competitive. Now beaten an    year old child. Well done. Milo  Okay. PM  So  Milo's being called back in by his parents  giving us time to be alone and to help him out. Basically    the bit that we missed at the start    his parents had asked him to clean up his room. And we're going to help him with this now. But this is going to be an introduction  and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use. We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part  you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo. Now  to do that  we needed a set up  like a magician's trick. And what we did was  we needed to give Milo this big problem. So as Dimitri starts tidying up  you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents. Milo's Mom  Oh  you've got gravy all over the floor.  Milo  I didn't mean to   Milo's Mom  That carpet is brand new. PM  So he's just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor  on the brand new carpet. We've all done it as parents  we've all done it as children. Now's a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down. It's all been too much for him. He's just moved house. He's got no friends. Now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to Milo. Female Voice  Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up. Dimitri  Come on  Milo. You know what parents are like. They're always getting stressed. Milo  What do they want to come here for anyway  We don't know anyone. Dimitri  Well  you've got a new school to go to. You're going to meet loads of cool  new friends. Milo  I just really miss my old house  that's all. Dimitri  Well  this is a pretty awesome house  Milo. You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. Milo  It was good skimming stones. This looks nice. You cleaned up my room. Thanks. PM  So after three quarters of an hour  he recognizes you. And I promise you  if you're sitting in front of this screen  that is a truly wonderful moment. And we're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life  and it goes on  and he has  you know  many adventures. Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side. Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging    he's got to go to school. The cool thing is that we're doing as well  as you interact with him  you're able to put things into his world  he recognizes objects. His mind is based in a cloud. That means Milo's mind  as millions of people use it  will get smarter and cleverer. He'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words. But for me  this is a wonderful opportunity where technology  at last  can be connected with  where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand    as far as a computer game's concerned    or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book. And I love those revolutions  and I love the future that Milo brings. Thank you very much indeed. This talk is about righting writing wrongs. No  the sound's not faulty    righting writing wrongs. The Middle East is huge  and with all our problems  one thing's for sure  we love to laugh. I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences. We need to take our responsibilities seriously  but not ourselves. Don't get me wrong  it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East. I grew up at a time when iconic actors from Kuwait  Syria  Egypt used laughter to unite the region  just as football can. Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves  before others can laugh with us. This is the story of the rise and rise of stand up comedy in the Middle East    a stand up uprising  if you will. Working in London as TV maker and writer  I quickly realized that comedy connects audiences. Now  the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand up comedy circuit  where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly. An unfortunate connection for us maybe  but it reminds me that we'd like to thank one man for  over the past decade  working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world  specifically comedians with a Middle Eastern background. Like my good friends  Dean and Maysoon  at the bottom of the screen  who  two years after       started a festival to change the way Middle Easterners are perceived in the world. It's still going strong  with positive press to die for. Also  three guys working for years in Los Angeles  an Iranian  a Palestinian and an Egyptian  created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act. And wherever they went  they killed. Now  I didn't start this fire  but I did pour petrol on it. I moved to Dubai as the head of original content for a Western TV network. My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience. Now  the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy. In a thick Arabic accent  my brain went   Berfect.  Now  I had friends in the U.S. who had started a successful new tribe. And I had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the Middle East and pushing them over the tipping point towards success. Now  as with any new idea  it wasn't easy. I had four phases to this plan. First  we'd need to buy content from the West and air it. Then I'd bring my friends  and we'd show local amateurs how it's done. We would film that and air it  and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy. I excitedly presented this to the big boss  and his reaction was   Um  I don't get it.  So I retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub. Now  fast forward two years  to early     . The earth rotated  as did our management  and as if by divine intervention  things came together to help this revolution take shape. Here's how the dots connected. First  the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special that aired in the States  and it was getting great hits on YouTube. Our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR ... and ideas du bon marche. Let's just say  value for money.  I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room. I invited our new CEO  and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels  his reaction was very simple   Let's make this happen. And one more thing  No  don't F it up.  So I quickly went to work with a great team around me. I happened to find a funny guy to present it in Arabic  who is originally Korean  a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil. This is all true. Now  while preparing for the tour  I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive. I used the three Bs of stand up don'ts as I call them in the Middle East  blue content  keep it clean  beliefs  not religion  and the third B  bolitics. Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East. Oh course  you might think  what's left without bolitics  sex and religion  how can you make people laugh  I'd say  watch any successful well written  family friendly sitcom in the West for your answers. Now  were the Axis successful  In five countries  in just under a month  we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live. We had millions see them on TV and on TV news. In Jordan  we had His Majesty the King come and see them. In fact  they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD  even before it was released in the Middle East. Anywhere you go. So everywhere we went  we auditioned amateurs. We filmed that process and aired a documentary. I called it  Three Guys and Wonho.  It really is his name. And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause. In Dubai this year  we've just had the first all women's  homegrown stand up show. And notice two of them are wearing headscarves  and yes  even they can laugh. Dubai  to me  is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.    years ago  no one had heard of it. Look at it now. With an inspirational leader  I think this year  the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like adding a finger to that hand  that points at all those who spread fallacious stories about us. Now  in three short years  we've come a long way with stand up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia. These comics are now going to the New York festival. And the Lebanese  brilliant Lebanese  Nemr Abou Nassar  we featured in our first tour  has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs. So clearly  from the inside  we are doing our best to change our image  and it's exploding. So  as for the outsiders looking in  watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival. The reporter did a great job  and I thank her  but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom. For example  when Dean talks  the ticker says   U.S.  Suspect gave 'actionable intel.  Well  if you're used to listening to comedians  then I'm not surprised. Sadly  this leads me to another three Bs that represents how the media in the West talks about us as bombers  billionaires and belly dancers. Enough. We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel. We have a positive story to tell and image to sell. In fact  one thing's for sure  in my experience  we love to laugh like hell. Here are three questions that I like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story. One  Is the Middle East being shown in a current time and correct context  Two  Do the Middle Eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes  Three  Is the Middle Eastern character being played by one  Clearly  there are wrongs that need to be righted. We've started in our region. My challenge to the rest of the world is please  start using positive Middle Eastern images in your stories. For inspiration  go to one of our festivals  go online  drop us a line. Let's change the narrative together and let's start righting writing wrongs. I'd like to end  before going back to the Middle East  with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs to put quill to parchment. As my father likes to call him   Asheikh Azubare   as my mother would say   Shakespeare.   And now we go in content to liberty and not to banishment.  Thank you. I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour. The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed  who is an Egyptian American  who actually had the idea to go to the Middle East and try it out. Before we went out as a tour  he went out solo and did it first. Then there was Aron Kader  who was the Palestinian American. And then there was me  the Iranian American of the group. Now  being Iranian American presents its own set of problems  as you know. Those two countries aren't getting along these days. So it causes a lot of inner conflict  you know  like part of me likes me  part of me hates me. Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program  the other part thinks I can't be trusted with one. These are dilemmas I have every day. But I was born in Iran  I'm now an American citizen  which means I have the American passport  which means I can travel. Because if you only have the Iranian passport  you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms  you know    Syria  Venezuela  North Korea. So anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you  when you get your passport  it still says what country you were born in. So I remember getting my American passport. I was like   Woohoo  I'm going to travel.  And I opened it up  it said   Born in Iran.  I'm like   Oh  come on  man.   I'm trying to go places.  But what's interesting is  I've never had trouble traveling in any other Western countries with my American passport  even though it says   Born in Iran.  No problems. Where I've had some problems is some of the Arab countries  because I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either. And so I was in Kuwait recently  doing a comedy show with some other American comedians. They all went through  and then the border patrol saw my American passport.  Ah ha  American  great.  Then he opened it up.  Born in Iran  Wait.  And he started asking me questions. He said   What is your father's name   I said   Well  he's passed away  but his name was Khosro.  He goes   What is your grandfather's name   I said   He passed away a long time ago. His name was Jabbar.  He says   You wait. I'll be back   and he walked away. And I started freaking out  because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into. Thought the guy was going to come back and be like   We've been looking for you for     years.   Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue. You owe us two billion dollars.  But as you can see  when I talk  I speak with an American accent  which you would think as an Iranian American actor  I should be able to play any part  good  bad  what have you. But a lot of times in Hollywood  when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent  they go   Oh  you're Iranian. Great. Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah '   I could say that  but what if I were to say  'Hello. I'm your doctor '  They go   Great. And then you hijack the hospital.  Like I think you're missing the point here. Don't get me wrong  I don't mind playing bad guys. I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank. I want to rob a bank in a film. I want to rob a bank in a film  but do it with a gun  with a gun  not with a bomb strapped around me  right. Because I imagine the director   Maz  I think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around him.   Why would I do that  If I want the money  why would I kill myself   Right.  Gimme all your money  or I'll blow myself up.   Well  then blow yourself up. Just do it outside  please.  But the fact is  there's good people everywhere. That's what I try and show in my stand up. There's good people everywhere. All it takes in one person to mess it up. Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York  there was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb. Now  I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show. And a few months before that  there was a white American guy in Austin  Texas who flew his airplane into the IRS building  and I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand up comedy show. Now I'll tell you  as a Middle Eastern male  when you show up around a lot of these activities  you start feeling guilty at one point. I was watching the news. I'm like   Am I involved in this crap    I didn't get the memo. What's going on   But what was interesting was  the Pakistani Muslim guy    see he gives a bad name to Muslims and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world. And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban took credit for that failed car bombing. My question is  why would you take credit for a failed car bombing   We just wanted to say we tried.   And furthermore  it is the thought that counts.   And in conclusion  win some  lose some.  But what happened was  when the white guy flew his plane into the building  I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States were watching TV  going   Please  don't be Middle Eastern. Don't be Hassan. Don't be Hussein.  And the name came out Jack. I'm like   Woooo  That's not one of us.  But I kept watching the news in case they came back  they were like   Before he did it  he converted to Islam.   Damn it  Why Jack  Why   But the fact is  I've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world  and I did a lot of shows in the Middle East. I just did a seven country solo tour. I was in Oman  and I was in Saudi Arabia. I was in Dubai. And it's great  there's good people everywhere. And you learn great things about these places. I encourage people always to go visit these places. For example  Dubai    cool place. They're obsessed with having the biggest  tallest  longest  as we all know. They have a mall there  the Dubai Mall. It is so big  they have taxis in the mall. I was walking. I heard  Beep  beep.  I'm like   What are you doing here   He goes   I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away. Out of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way.  And what's crazy    there's a recession going on  even in Dubai  but you wouldn't know by the prices. Like in the Dubai Mall  they sell frozen yogurt by the gram. It's like a drug deal. I was walking by. The guy goes   Psst. Habibi  my friend.   You want some frozen yogurt  Come here. Come here. Come here. I have one gram  five gram     gram. How many gram do you want   I bought five grams.    dollars.    dollars  I said   What's in this   He's like   Good stuff  man. Columbian. Top of the line. Top of the line.  The other thing you learn sometimes when you travel to these countries in the Middle East  sometimes in Latin American countries  South American countries    a lot of times when they build stuff  there's no rules and regulations. For example  I took my two year old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall. And I've taken my two year old son to playgrounds all over the United States. And when you put your two year old on a slide in the United States  they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide. Not in the Middle East. I put my two year old on the slide  he went frrmrmm  He took off. I went down. I go   Where's my son    On the third floor  sir. On the third floor.   You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left.   Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive.  But one of the things I try to do with my stand up is to break stereotypes. And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well. I was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai. And they don't get paid that well. And I got it in my head that all the Indians there must be workers. And I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai as well. I was doing a show  and they said   We're going to send a driver to pick you up.  So I went down to the lobby  and I saw this Indian guy. I go   He's got to be my driver.  Because he was standing there in like a cheap suit  thin mustache  staring at me. So I went over   Excuse me  sir  are you my driver   He goes   No  sir. I own the hotel.  I go   I'm sorry. Then why were you staring at me   He goes   I thought you were my driver.  I'll leave you guys with this  I try  with my stand up  to break stereotypes  present Middle Easterners in a positive light    Muslims in a positive light    and I hope that in the coming years  more film and television programs come out of Hollywood presenting us in a positive light. Who knows  maybe one day we'll even have our own James Bond  right.  My name is Bond  Jamal Bond.  Til then  I'll keep telling jokes. I hope you keep laughing. Have a good day. Thank you. My name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR. I am a proud Princeton dropout. Also proud to have relocated here to Boston  where I actually grew up. Yeah  Boston. Easy wins. I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here. So  I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world. And this is sort of a new concept  and it's really important. Because while the last decade was the decade of social and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built  this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built  where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior  and the framework in which that is constructed  is decided upon  and that's really important. And so I say that I want to build a game layer on top of the world  but that's not quite true because it's already under construction  it's already happening. And it looks like this right now. It looks like the Web did back in       right  It's not very good. It's cluttered. It's filled with lots of different things that  in short  aren't that fun. There are credit card schemes and airline mile programs and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and actually are building the game layer  they just suck. They're not very well designed  right  So  that's unfortunate. But luckily  as my favorite action hero  Bob the Builder  says   We can do better. We can build this better.  And the tools  the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves. And so  sort of  the crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game dynamics  really interesting things  that  if you use consciously  you can use to influence behavior  both for good  for bad  for in between. Hopefully for good. But this is sort of the important stages in which that framework will get built  and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now. Just before we jump into that  there's sort of a question of  why is this important  I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world  and that it's very important that we build it properly. The reason that it's so important is that  the last decade  what we've seen has been building the social layer  has been this framework for connections  and construction on that layer is over  it's finished. There's still a lot to explore. There's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this  but the framework itself is done  and it's called Facebook. And that's okay  right  A lot of people are very happy with Facebook. I like it quite a lot. They've created this thing called the Open Graph  and they own all of our connections. They own half a billion people. And so when you want to build on the social layer  the framework has been decided  it is the Open Graph API. And if you're happy with that  fantastic. If you're not  too bad. There's nothing you can do. But this next decade    and that's a real thing. I mean  we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it  you know  productive down the road. So  the social layer is all about these connections. The game layer is all about influence. It's not about adding a social fabric to the Web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go. It's actually about using dynamics  using forces  to influence the behavior of where you are  what you do there  how you do it. That's really  really powerful  and it's going to be more important than the social layer. It's going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly. And so it's incredibly critical that at this moment  while it's just getting constructed  while the frameworks like Facebook  like the Open Graph  are being created for the game layer equivalent  that we think about it very consciously  and that we do it in a way that is open  that is available  and that can be leveraged for good. And so that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics  because construction has just begun  and the more consciously we can think about this  the better we'll be able to use it for anything that we want. So like I said  the way that you go through and build on the game layer is not with glass and steel and cement. And the resources that we use are not this two dimensional swath of land that we have. The resources are mindshare and the tools  the raw materials are these game dynamics. So with that  you know  a couple game dynamics to talk about. Four. Back at SCVNGR  we like to joke that with seven game dynamics  you can get anyone to do anything. And so today  I'm going to show you four  because I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this  still. So the first one  it's a very simple game dynamic. It's called the appointment dynamic. And this is a dynamic in which to succeed  players have to do something at a predefined time  generally at a predefined place. And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes  because you think  you know  other people can be using forces that will manipulate how I interact  what I do  where I do it  when I do it. This sort of loss of free will that occurs in games can be frightening  so with each dynamic  I'm going to give three examples  one that shows how this is already being used in the real world  so you can sort of rationalize it a little bit  one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game    I think everything is a game  but this is sort of more of a what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen  and then one how this can be used for good  so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful. So the first one    the most famous appointment dynamic in the world    is something called happy hour. So I just recently dropped out of Princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar  and I saw these happy hour things all over the place  right. And this is simply an appointment dynamic. Come here at a certain time  get your drinks half off. To win  all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time. This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior  it's influenced our entire culture. That's a really scary thought  that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully. It also exists in more conventional game forms. I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now. If you haven't  I recommend playing it. You won't do anything else with the rest of your day. Farmville has more active users than Twitter. It's incredibly powerful  and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your crops    fake crops    or they wilt. And this is so powerful that  when they tweak their stats  when they say your crops wilt after eight hours  or after six hours  or after    hours  it changes the lifecycle of    million some people during the day. They will return like clockwork at different times. So if they wanted the world to end  if they wanted productivity to stop  they could make this a    minute cycle  and no one could do anything else  right  That's a little scary. But this could also be used for good. This is a local company called Vitality  and they've created a product to help people take their medicine on time. That's an appointment. It's something that people don't do very well. And they have these GlowCaps  which  you know  flash and email you and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine. This is one that isn't a game yet  but really should be. You should get points for doing this on time. You should lose points for not doing this on time. They should consciously recognize that they've built an appointment dynamic and leverage the games. And then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways. We're going to jump onto the next one  maybe. Yes. Influence and status. So this is one of the most famous game dynamics. It's used all over the place. It's used in your wallets  right now. We all want that credit card on the far left because it's black. And you see someone at CVS or    not CVS    at Christian Dior or something  and then ... I don't know. I don't have a black card  I've got a debit card. So they whip it out. And you see men  they have that black card. I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am  and I need that. And this is used in games as well.  Modern Warfare   one of the most successful selling games of all time. I'm only a level four  but I desperately want to be a level     because they've got that cool red badge thing  and that means that I am somehow better than everyone else. And that's very powerful to me. Status is really good motivator. It's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings. School    and remember  I made it through one year  so I think I'm qualified to talk on school    is a game  it's just not a terribly well designed game  right. There are levels. There are C. There are B. There is A. There are statuses. I mean  what is valedictorian  but a status  If we called valedictorian a  white knight paladin level      I think people would probably work a lot harder. So school is a game  and there have been lots of experimentations on how we do this properly. But let's use it consciously. Like why have games that you can lose  Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C  That sucks. Why not level up  And at Princeton  they've actually experimented with this  where they have quizzes where you gain experience points  and you level up from B to an A. And it's very powerful. It can be used in interesting ways. The third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression dynamic  where you have to sort of make progress  you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion. This is used all over the place  including LinkedIn  where I am an un whole individual. I am only    percent complete on LinkedIn  and that bothers me. And this is so deep seated in our psyche that when we're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy  granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar  we will do it. We will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen. This is used in conventional games as well. I mean  you see this is a paladin level     and that's a paladin level     and if you were going to fight  you know  orcs on the fields of Mordor against the Raz al Ghul  you'd probably want to be the bigger one  right. I would. And so people work very hard to level up.  World of Warcraft  is one of the most successful games of all time. The average player spends something like six  six and a half hours a day on it. Their most dedicated players  it's like a full time job. It's insane. And they have these systems where you can level up. And that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful. It can also be used in very compelling ways for good. One of the things that we work on at SCVNGR is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses  to sort of something that is very key to the economy. And here we have a game that people play. They go places  they do challenges  they earn points. And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it  where  by going to the same place over and over  by doing challenges  by engaging with the business  you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen  and you eventually unlock rewards. And this is powerful enough that we can see that it hooks people into these dynamics  pulls them back to the same local businesses  creates huge loyalty  creates engagement  and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses. These progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world. The final one I want to talk about    and it's a great one to end on    is this concept of communal discovery  a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something. And communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems. This is used in some sort of famous consumer web stories  like Digg  which I'm sure you've all heard of. Digg is a communal dynamic to try to find and source the best news  the most interesting stories. And they made this into a game  initially. They had a leader board  where  if you recommended the best stories  you would get points. And that really motivated people to find the best stories. But it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal  a group of people  the top seven on the leader board  who would work together to make sure they maintained that position. And they would recommend other people's stories  and the game became more powerful than the goal. And they actually had to end up shutting down the leader board because while it was effective  it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership. So we have to use this one carefully. It's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly  where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing  but the sort of cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk  right. And now they're just looking for a little sticker that says  Boardwalk.  But it can also be used to find real things. This is the DARPA balloon challenge  where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said   Use networks. Try and find these balloons fastest  and the winner will get        .  And the winner was actually a group out of MIT  where they created sort of a pyramid scheme  a network  where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got        and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut of it. And in    hours  they were able to find all these balloons  all across the country  right. Really powerful dynamic. And so  I've got about    seconds left  so if I'm going to leave you with anything  last decade was the decade of social. This next decade is the decade of games. We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare. We can influence behavior. It is very powerful. It is very exciting. Let's all build it together  let's do it well and have fun playing. It feels like we're all suffering from information overload or data glut. And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that  and that's using our eyes more. So  visualizing information  so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter and then designing that information so it makes more sense  or it tells a story  or allows us to focus only on the information that's important. Failing that  visualized information can just look really cool. So  let's see. This is the  Billion Dollar o Gram  and this image arose out of frustration I had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press. That is  they're meaningless without context      billion for this pipeline     billion for this war. It doesn't make any sense  so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively. So I scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts. And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money. So purple is  fighting   and red is  giving money away   and green is  profiteering.  And what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers. You can literally see them. But more importantly  you start to see patterns and connections between numbers that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports. Let me point out some that I really like. This is OPEC's revenue  this green box here        billion a year. And this little pixel in the corner    three billion    that's their climate change fund. Americans  incredibly generous people    over     billion a year  donated to charity every year  compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top    industrialized nations at     billion. Then of course  the Iraq War  predicted to cost just    billion back in     . And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to       billion. So now it's great because now we have this texture  and we can add numbers to it as well. So we could say  well  a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt. How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that Africa owes to the West  Let's take a look. So there it is      billion is what Africa owes. And the recent financial crisis  how much of this diagram might that figure take up  What has that cost the world  Let's take a look at that. Dooosh    Which I think is the appropriate sound effect for that much money         billion. So  by visualizing this information  we turned it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes  a kind of map really  a sort of information map. And when you're lost in information  an information map is kind of useful. So I want to show you another landscape now. We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like. Let's take a look. This is Mountains Out of Molehills  a timeline of global media panic. So  I'll label this for you in a second. But the height here  I want to point out  is the intensity of certain fears as reported in the media. Let me point them out. So this  swine flu    pink. Bird flu. SARS    brownish here. Remember that one  The millennium bug  terrible disaster. These little green peaks are asteroid collisions. And in summer  here  killer wasps. So these are what our fears look like over time in our media. But what I love    and I'm a journalist    and what I love is finding hidden patterns  I love being a data detective. And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it. Let me highlight it for you. See this line  this is a landscape for violent video games. As you can see  there's a kind of odd  regular pattern in the data  twin peaks every year. If we look closer  we see those peaks occur at the same month every year. Why  Well  November  Christmas video games come out  and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content. But April isn't a particularly massive month for video games. Why April  Well  in April      was the Columbine shooting  and since then  that fear has been remembered by the media and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year. You have retrospectives  anniversaries  court cases  even copy cat shootings  all pushing that fear into the agenda. And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it  See that gap there  There's a gap  and it affects all the other stories. Why is there a gap there  You see where it starts  September       when we had something very real to be scared about. So  I've been working as a data journalist for about a year  and I keep hearing a phrase all the time  which is this   Data is the new oil.  Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights  and it's all around us  and it can be mined very easily. It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times  especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico  but I would  perhaps  adapt this metaphor slightly  and I would say that data is the new soil. Because for me  it feels like a fertile  creative medium. Over the years  online  we've laid down a huge amount of information and data  and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity  and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments. And  all right  I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit. But it's a really fertile medium  and it feels like visualizations  infographics  data visualizations  they feel like flowers blooming from this medium. But if you look at it directly  it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts. But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way  interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed. Let me show you this. Can you guess what this data set is  What rises twice a year  once in Easter and then two weeks before Christmas  has a mini peak every Monday  and then flattens out over the summer  I'll take answers. You might want to get some chocolate in. Any other guesses  Yeah  retail therapy might help. DM  Sick leave. Yeah  you'll definitely want to take some time off. Shall we see  So  the information guru Lee Byron and myself  we scraped        status Facebook updates for the phrase  break up  and  broken up  and this is the pattern we found    people clearing out for Spring Break  coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday  being single over the summer  and then the lowest day of the year  of course  Christmas Day. Who would do that  So there's a titanic amount of data out there now  unprecedented. But if you ask the right kind of question  or you work it in the right kind of way  interesting things can emerge. So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful. I wonder if I could make my life beautiful. And here's my visual C.V. I'm not quite sure I've succeeded. Pretty blocky  the colors aren't that great. But I wanted to convey something to you. I started as a programmer  and then I worked as a writer for many years  about    years  in print  online and then in advertising  and only recently have I started designing. And I've never been to design school. I've never studied art or anything. I just kind of learned through doing. And when I started designing  I discovered an odd thing about myself. I already knew how to design  but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it  but more like I was sensitive to the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography. It's almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me. And I don't feel like I'm unique. I feel that everyday  all of us now are being blasted by information design. It's being poured into our eyes through the Web  and we're all visualizers now  we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information. There's something almost quite magical about visual information. It's effortless  it literally pours in. And if you're navigating a dense information jungle  coming across a beautiful graphic or a lovely data visualization  it's a relief  it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle. I was curious about this  so it led me to the work of a Danish physicist called Tor Norretranders  and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms. So here we go. This is your senses  pouring into your senses every second. Your sense of sight is the fastest. It has the same bandwidth as a computer network. Then you have touch  which is about the speed of a USB key. And then you have hearing and smell  which has the throughput of a hard disk. And then you have poor old taste  which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator. And that little square in the corner  a naught .  percent  that's the amount we're actually aware of. So a lot of your vision    the bulk of it is visual  and it's pouring in. It's unconscious. The eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color  shape and pattern. It loves them  and it calls them beautiful. It's the language of the eye. If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind  which is about words and numbers and concepts  you start speaking two languages simultaneously  each enhancing the other. So  you have the eye  and then you drop in the concepts. And that whole thing    it's two languages both working at the same time. So we can use this new kind of language  if you like  to alter our perspective or change our views. Let me ask you a simple question with a really simple answer  Who has the biggest military budget  It's got to be America  right  Massive.     billion in              rather. So massive  in fact  that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself. Gobble  gobble  gobble  gobble  gobble. Now  you can see Africa's total debt there and the U.K. budget deficit for reference. So that might well chime with your view that America is a sort of warmongering military machine  out to overpower the world with its huge industrial military complex. But is it true that America has the biggest military budget  Because America is an incredibly rich country. In fact  it's so massively rich that it can contain the four other top industrialized nations' economies inside itself  it's so vastly rich. So its military budget is bound to be enormous. So  to be fair and to alter our perspective  we have to bring in another data set  and that data set is GDP  or the country's earnings. Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP  Let's have a look. That changes the picture considerably. Other countries pop into view that you  perhaps  weren't considering  and American drops into eighth. Now you can also do this with soldiers. Who has the most soldiers  It's got to be China. Of course   .  million. Again  chiming with your view that China has a militarized regime ready to  you know  mobilize its enormous forces. But of course  China has an enormous population. So if we do the same  we see a radically different picture. China drops to    th. It actually has a tiny army when you take other data into consideration. So  absolute figures  like the military budget  in a connected world  don't give you the whole picture. They're not as true as they could be. We need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture  and then that can lead to us changing our perspective. As Hans Rosling  the master  my master  said   Let the dataset change your mindset.  And if it can do that  maybe it can also change your behavior. Take a look at this one. I'm a bit of a health nut. I love taking supplements and being fit  but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence. There's always conflicting evidence. Should I take vitamin C  Should I be taking wheatgrass  This is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements. This kind of diagram is called a balloon race. So the higher up the image  the more evidence there is for each supplement. And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits. So you can immediately apprehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity  but you can also  if you grade the evidence  do a  worth it  line. So supplements above this line are worth investigating  but only for the conditions listed below  and then the supplements below the line are perhaps not worth investigating. Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work. We scraped like       studies from PubMed  the biomedical database  and we compiled them and graded them all. And it was incredibly frustrating for me because I had a book of     visualizations to do for my book  and I spent a month doing this  and I only filled two pages. But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression. It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space. And once you've curated that data  and once you've cleaned that data  and once it's there  you can do cool stuff like this. So I converted this into an interactive app  so I can now generate this application online    this is the visualization online    and I can say   Yeah  brilliant.  So it spawns itself. And then I can say   Well  just show me the stuff that affects heart health.  So let's filter that out. So heart is filtered out  so I can see if I'm curious about that. I think   No  no. I don't want to take any synthetics  I just want to see plants and    just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients.  Now this app is spawning itself from the data. The data is all stored in a Google Doc  and it's literally generating itself from that data. So the data is now alive  this is a living image  and I can update it in a second. New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet. Doosh  Again  the image recreates itself. So it's cool. It's kind of living. But it can go beyond data  and it can go beyond numbers. I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts. This is a visualization of the political spectrum  an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down from government into society and culture  into families  into individuals  into their beliefs and back around again in a cycle. What I love about this image is it's made up of concepts  it explores our worldviews and it helps us    it helps me anyway    to see what others think  to see where they're coming from. And it feels just incredibly cool to do that. What was most exciting for me designing this was that  when I was designing this image  I desperately wanted this side  the left side  to be better than the right side    being a journalist  a Left leaning person    but I couldn't  because I would have created a lopsided  biased diagram. So  in order to really create a full image  I had to honor the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time  uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me  which was very  very annoying and uncomfortable. But not too uncomfortable  because there's something unthreatening about seeing a political perspective  versus being told or forced to listen to one. You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them. It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual. So that's what's exciting to me  seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream    beautiful  lovely data. So  just to wrap up  I wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions  and information design is about solving information problems. It feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment  from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency  or even just interestingness. I mean  I find information just too interesting. It has a magnetic quality that draws me in. So  visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems. Even when the information is terrible  the visual can be quite beautiful. Often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly  like this one  the recent Icelandic volcano. Which was emitting the most CO   Was it the planes or the volcano  the grounded planes or the volcano  So we can have a look. We look at the data and we see  Yep  the volcano emitted         tons  the grounded planes would have emitted         if they were in the sky. So essentially  we had our first carbon neutral volcano. And that is beautiful. Thank you. Come with me to the bottom of the world  Antarctica  the highest  driest  windiest  and yes  coldest region on Earth    more arid than the Sahara and  in parts  colder than Mars. The ice of Antarctica glows with a light so dazzling  it blinds the unprotected eye. Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it. The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level  beneath its weight. Yet  the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change. It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages. Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record. And here  scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change. This past January  I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide  about     miles from the South Pole. It is the best place on the planet  many say  to study the history of climate change. There  about    scientists from the University of Wisconsin  the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming. What is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures  It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising. This past May was the warmest worldwide on record. And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too. What we don't know is the exact  precise  immediate impact of these changes on natural climate patterns    winds  ocean currents  precipitation rates  cloud formation  things that bear on the health and well being of billions of people. Their entire camp  every item of gear  was ferried     miles from McMurdo Station  the main U.S. supply base on the coast of Antarctica. WAIS Divide itself though  is a circle of tents in the snow. In blizzard winds  the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse. It snows so heavily there  the installation was almost immediately buried. Indeed  the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here    times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica. They have to dig themselves out every day. It makes for an exotic and chilly commute. But under the surface is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight million dollar drill assembly. Periodically  this drill  like a biopsy needle  plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis. Ten times a day  they extract the    foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow  season after season for thousands of years. It's really a time machine. At the peak of activity earlier this year  the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another     years deeper into the past. Periodically  they remove a cylinder of ice  like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill. They inspect it  they check it for cracks  for drill damage  for spalls  for chips. More importantly  they prepare it for inspection and analysis by    independent laboratories in the United States and Europe  who will examine it for    different trace chemicals related to climate  some in parts per quadrillion. Yes  I said that with a Q  quadrillion. They cut the cylinders up into three foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs  some       miles from the drill site. Each cylinder is a parfait of time. This ice formed as snow        years ago  when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet. Bathed in polarized light and cut in cross section  this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors  each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch. Every year  it begins with a snowflake  and by digging into fresh snow  we can see how this process is ongoing today. This wall of undisturbed snow  back lit by sunlight  shows the striations of winter and summer snow  layer upon layer. Each storm scours the atmosphere  washing out dust  soot  trace chemicals  and depositing them on the snow pack year after year  millennia after millennia  creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than        feet thick. From this  we can detect an extraordinary number of things. We can see the calcium from the world's deserts  soot from distant wildfires  methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon  all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place. Most importantly  these cylinders and this snow trap air. Each cylinder is about    percent ancient air  a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases    carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide    all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell. And this is the object of their scrutiny. But don't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases  Why do we need to study this anymore  Don't we already know how they affect temperatures  Don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization  The truth is  we only know the outlines  and what we don't completely understand  we can't properly fix. Indeed  we run the risk of making things worse. Consider  the single most successful international environmental effort of the   th century  the Montreal Protocol  in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners  refrigerators and other cooling devices. We banned those chemicals  and we replaced them  unknowingly  with other substances that  molecule per molecule  are a hundred times more potent as heat trapping  greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. This process requires extraordinary precautions. The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated. Moreover  in this       mile journey  they have to insure this ice doesn't melt. Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics. They have to  in fact  make sure this ice never gets warmer than about    degrees below zero  otherwise  the key gases inside it will dissipate. So  in the coldest place on Earth  they work inside a refrigerator. As they handle the ice  in fact  they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven  so that  when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen  they can don a fresh pair. They work against the clock and against the thermometer. So far  they've packed up about       feet of ice cores for shipment back to the United States. This past season  they manhandled them across the ice to waiting aircraft. The    th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica  where it was boarded onto a freighter  shipped across the tropics to California  unloaded  put on a truck  driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver  Colorado  where  as we speak  scientists are now slicing this material up for samples  for analysis  to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe. Antarctica was this planet's last empty quarter    the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world. Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map  and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended. Here  the ice seems a living presence. The wind that rubs against it gives it voice. It is a voice of experience. It is a voice we should heed. Thank you. Cartoons are basically short stories. I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words. Not all of them have happy endings. So how did I get started cartooning  I doodled a lot as a kid  and if you spend enough time doodling  sooner or later  something happens  all your career options run out. So you have to make a living cartooning. Actually  I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy  when I was about eight or nine. And I was particularly fascinated with sharks. This is some of my early work. Eventually  my mom took the red crayon away  so it was  unclear . But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently  and it's become the foundation of my work because  I feel like  if in a day  I can see the ocean differently  then I can evoke that same kind of change in others  especially kids. Before that day  this is how I saw the ocean. It's just a big blue surface. And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time. It's a mystery. There's been a lot of folklore developed around the ocean  mostly negative. And that prompted people to make maps like this  with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land  but when you get to the waters edge  the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint. And this is the way I saw the ocean at school    as if to say   All geography and science lessons stop at water's edge. This part's not going to be on the test.  But that day I flew low over the islands    it was a family trip to the Caribbean  and I flew in a small plane low over the islands. This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys. I saw forests and meadows. I saw grottoes and secret gardens and places I'd love to hide as a kid  if I could only breathe underwater. And best of all  I saw the animals. I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in. And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it  and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born. So from that day on  I was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land  but my head was down there  underwater. Up until that day  these were the animals that were most common in my life. These were the ones I'd like to draw    all variations of four legs and fur. But when you got to the ocean  my imagination was no competition for nature. Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board  I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier. And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science fiction movie. Whenever I talk to kids  I always like to tell them  the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive. It's not a dinosaur  it's a whale  animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean. Speaking of dinosaurs  sharks are basically the same fish they were     million years ago. So if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like  that's what a dinosaur looks like. So you have living dinosaurs and space aliens  animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions. It's just incredible  no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that. Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water make it look like it's floating in outer space. Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that  It would start a whole new space race. But instead  we stick a camera in the deep ocean  and we see a fish  and it doesn't capture our imagination as a society. We say to ourselves   Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something.  So  what I'd like to do now is try a little drawing. So  I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here. I love to draw the deep sea fish  because they are so ugly  but beautiful in their own way. Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here    give him a headlight  maybe a brake light  turn signals. But it's easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters  their shapes and sizes. So some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book. For instance  take these sea turtles. They kind of have a sixth sense like Superman's x ray vision. They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth. And they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean. I kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with. Or take this sea cucumber. It's not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all. He's like an underwater Spiderman. He shoots out these sticky webs to entangle his enemy. Of course  sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears  which  in my opinion  makes them much more interesting a superhero. He can't spin a web anytime  he's got to pull his pants down first. Or the blowfish. The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk. It can change its body into a big  intimidating fish in a matter of seconds. I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated. And then I'm going to attempt onscreen animation here. Let's see. Try and inflate it.  You talkin' to me   See  he can inflate himself when he wants to be intimidating. Or take this swordfish. Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose  Do you think he wakes up in the morning  looks in the mirror and says   Somebody's getting stabbed today.  Or this lionfish for instance. Imagine trying to make friends covered with razor sharp poisonous barbs. It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page  right  My characters are    my lead character's a shark named Sherman. He's a great white shark. And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman. I didn't want to go with this ruthless predator image. He's kind of just out there making a living. He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins. And then his sidekick is a sea turtle  as I mentioned before  named Filmore. He uses his wonderful skills at navigation to wander the oceans  looking for a mate. And he does manage to find them  but great navigation skills  lousy pick up lines. He never seems to settle on any particular girl. I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne  who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab  so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark. And then I'll introduce you to one more character  this guy  Ernest  who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body. So with characters  you can make stories. Sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room and seeing what happens. So  imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom. Or  sometimes I take them to places that people have never heard of because they're underwater. For instance  I took them skiing in the Mid Atlantic Range  which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic. I've taken them to the Sea of Japan  where they met giant jellyfish. I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California. This next one here  I did a story on the census of marine life. And that was a lot of fun because  as most of you know  it's a real project we've heard about. But it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters. So we start off the story with Ernest  who volunteers as a census taker. He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish. Then he meets the yeti crab  the famous vampire squid    elusive  hard to find    and the Dumbo octopus  which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it. I did another story on marine debris. I was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business  and they    I asked them   So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about   And they said    this one friend of mine said   I've got one word for you  plastic.  And I told him   Well  I need something a little sexier than that. Plastic just is not going to do it.  We sort of worked things out. He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride  which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well. I couldn't fit them in. So what I did was I made an adventure strip. Basically  this bottle travels a long way. What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away  it just continues to wash downstream. And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean  which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it  especially if they can't stand each other  like these two. So  I sent them to Boise  Idaho  where they dropped a plastic bottle into the Boise sewer system. And it ended up in the Boise River and then on to the Columbia River and then to the mouth of the Columbia and to the Pacific Ocean and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch    which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific  where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around    and then back onto the lagoon. So that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along. So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway  but we really talked about marine debris and plastic in the course of that one. The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult. It was on shark finning  and I felt really strongly about this issue. And I felt like  since my main character was a shark  the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this. Now  finning is the act of taking a shark  cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water. It's cruel  it's wasteful. There's nothing funny or entertaining about it  but I really wanted to take this issue on. I had to kill my main character  who is a shark. We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant  who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler  which he does. And then he dies. He gets finned  and then he gets thrown overboard. Ostensibly  he's dead now. And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for    years. So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one. Meanwhile  the other characters are talking about shark fin soup. I do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue. Sherman's up in shark heaven. This is what I love about comic strips  you know. You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because  if you start with a talking shark  readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door. You can kind of do anything. It becomes a near death experience for Sherman. Meanwhile  Ernest finds his fins on the internet. There was a real website based in China that actually sold shark fins  so I kind of exposed that. And he clicks the  buy now  button. And voila  next day air  they show up  and they surgically reattach them. I ended that series with a kind of a mail in petition that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service  to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management. Thanks. I'd like to end with a little metaphor here. I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue  and this is what I came up with. Imagine you're in an enormous room  and it's as dark as a cave. And you can have anything in that room  anything you want  but you can't see anything. You've been given one tool  a hammer. So you wander around in the darkness  and you bump into something  and it feels like it's made of stone. It's big  it's heavy. You can't carry it away  so you bang it with your hammer  and you break off a piece. And you take the piece out into the daylight. And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster. So you say to yourself   Well  that's worth something.  So you go back into the room  and you break this thing to pieces  and you haul it away. And you find other things  and you break that up  and you haul those away. And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff. And you hear other people doing the same thing. So you get this sense of urgency  like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible. And then some yells   Stop   And they turn up the lights. And you realize where you are  you're in the Louvre. And you've taken all this complexity and beauty  and you've turned it into a cheap commodity. And that's what we're doing with the ocean. And part of what Mission Blue is about is yelling   Stop   so that each of us    explorer  scientist  cartoonist  singer  chef    can turn up the lights in their own way. And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way. That's why I like what I do. Thanks for listening. So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important  long  oily  hot summer  and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted. But before I talk about the political chemistry  I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil. This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in      to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice. And what you see here is  you see a little bit of crude oil  you see some ice cubes  and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm. The napalm is burning there quite nicely. And the thing is  is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer. We're four percent of the world's population  we use    percent of the world's oil production. And we don't really understand what oil is  until you check out its molecules  And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn. So this is what happens as that burn gets going. It takes off. It's a big woosh. I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday  because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again. It'll just bake your retinas. So there it is  the retinas are baking. Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil. Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules. It starts of with the very small ones  which are one carbon  four hydrogen    that's methane    it just floats off. Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon. You've probably heard of benzene rings  they're very carcinogenic. And it goes all the way over to these big  thick  galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons  and they have thousands of hydrogens  and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them. Those are called the asphaltenes  they're an ingredient in asphalt. They're very important in oil spills. Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water. It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous. Oil doesn't sink  it floats. If it sank  it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill. And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water. It spreads out to be really thin  so you have a hard time corralling it. The next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate  and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that  and shrimp. And then the asphaltenes    and this is the crucial thing    the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion  something like mayonnaise. It triples the amount of oily  messy goo that you have in the water  and it makes it very hard to handle. It also makes it very viscous. When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain  there were big  floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil  with the consistency  or the viscosity  of chewing gum. It's incredibly hard to clean up. And every single oil is different when it hits water. When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics  it's absolutely explosive. For the first time  American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves. They have a  eureka   moment  when we suddenly understand oil in a different context. So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics  because it's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important  why we need to stay focused. Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks   Wow  I'm going to go buy some three carbon to    carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work.  No  they think   Ugh. I have to go buy gas. I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off. They set the prices  and I don't even know. I am helpless over this.  And this is what happens to us at the gas pump    and actually  gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger. You might notice that many gas pumps  including this one  are designed to look like ATMs. I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger  because supposedly we feel good about ATMs. That shows you how bad it is. But actually  I mean  this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy  not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market. And the thing is  too  is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume  which is somewhat reasonable  because in fact  we have designed this system where  if you want to get a job  it's much more important to have a car that runs  to have a job and keep a job  than to have a GED. And that's actually very perverse. Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas  which is that we'd rather be doing anything else. This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles. It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.  Now   you think   why would something so lame work on people so smart   Well  the reason is  is because  when we're buying gas  we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance. I mean  we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else. We don't want to be buying oil  we want to be doing something green. And we get kind of in on our own con. I mean    and this is funny  it looks funny here. But in fact  that's why the slogan  beyond petroleum  worked. But it's an inherent part of our energy policy  which is we don't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use. We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars. We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet. And so  cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil  and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill. Okay  so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States. The oil industry is like a huge  gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else  but we actually see it in very moral terms. This is an early on photograph    you can see  we had these gushers. Early journalists looked at these spills  and they said   This is a filthy industry.  But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing. They weren't farmers  they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground. It's the  Beverly Hillbillies   basically. But in the beginning  this was seen as a very morally problematic thing  long before it became funny. And then  of course  there was John D. Rockefeller. And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild east of oil industry  and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company  a multinational. It was terrifying  you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now  imagine what this looked like in the     s or     s. And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy. But what's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell  the journalist  went in and did a big expos  of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place. But in many ways  that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us. And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said    she said   He has a thin nose like a thorn. There were no lips. There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them.  Okay  so that guy is actually still with us. I mean  this is a very pervasive    this is part of our DNA. And then there's this guy  okay. So  you might be wondering why it is that  every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill  we call these CEOs down to Washington  and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them. And this is something that we've been doing since       when we first asked them   Why are there these obscene profits   And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs. And we take it as  you know    we look at it on a moral level  rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level. And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions    I'm just saying that  when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards  you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate  or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil. So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction. But it makes for good theater  and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing. I mean  these pictures    this is from the Santa Barbara spill. You have these pictures of birds. They really influence people. When the Santa Barbara spill happened in       it formed the environmental movement in its modern form. It started Earth Day. It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act  the Clean Air Act  the Clean Water Act. Everything that we are really stemmed from this period. I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us. Here we are normally  we're standing at the gas pump  and we're feeling kind of helpless. We look at these pictures and we understand  for the first time  our role in this supply chain. We connect the dots in the supply chain. And we have this kind of    as voters  we have kind of a  eureka   moment. This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important. But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it. We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem. One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms. We were very reactive  as opposed to being proactive about what happened. And so what we did was  actually  we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling. We stopped drilling in ANWR  but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed. In fact  it's continued to increase. The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices. As you can see  our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out. We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves     percent of them are in the Persian Gulf. One of the things that's happened because of this is that  since       the country of Nigeria  or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil  which is the delta    which is two times the size of Maryland    has had thousands of oil spills a year. I mean  we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations. That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since     . And we can wrap our heads around the spills  because that's what we see here  but in fact  these guys actually live in a war zone. There's a thousand battle related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland  and it's all related to the oil. And these guys  I mean  if they were in the U.S.  they might be actually here in this room. They have degrees in political science  degrees in business    they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing. And it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us. The other thing that we've done  as we've continued to increase demand  is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs. One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad  with Exxon. So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it  the World Bank  Exxon paid for it. We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem. I was there in     . We were driving along this dark  dark road  and the guy in the green stepped out  and I was just like   Ahhh  This is it.  And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out  and we realized it was okay. They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields. But at the same time  Chad has become much more unstable  and we are not paying for that price at the pump. We pay for it in our taxes on April   th. We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open. This is         we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year. That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump. We pay for it on April   th  and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement. The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the Gulf of Mexico  which was not part of the moratoriums. Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico    as you can see  this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil. It's become this intense industrialized zone. It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has  but it should  I mean  it's a bird sanctuary. Also  every time you buy gasoline in the United States  half of it is actually being refined along the coast  because the Gulf actually has about    percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well. So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less clean environment. And finally  American families also pay a price for oil. Now on the one hand  the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil  but on the other hand  the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work  generally in a fairly crummy car. If you look at people who make         a year  they have two kids  they might have three jobs or more  and then they have to really commute. They're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care. And the same thing happens at the   th percentile  around       . Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy  but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher. So  what I'm going to talk to you about now is  what do we have to do this time  What are the laws  What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused  One thing is    we need to stay away from the theater. We need to stay away from the moratoriums. We need to focus really back again on the molecules. The moratoriums are fine  but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil. One of the things that we also need to do  is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world  before you reduce the amount of oil that we use. We need to focus on reducing the oil. What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy. It comes in on the side    the useful stuff is the dark gray  and the un useful stuff  which is called the rejected energy    the waste  goes up to the top. Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount. And one of the things that we need to do is  not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient  but we also need to fix the economy in general. We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel. For example  we have an insurance system where the person who drives        miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives      . We actually encourage people to drive more. We have policies that reward sprawl    we have all kinds of policies. We need to have more mobility choices. We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil. And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry  which is at least    billion dollars a year  into something that allows middle class people to find better ways to commute. Whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road  this is where we need to be. We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing  and you can find more about this policy. It's called STRONG  which is  Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually   and the idea is instead of being helpless  we need to be more strong. They're up at NewAmerica.net. What's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump  to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are  having kind of that special moment  where we connect the dots actually at the pump. Now supposedly  oil taxes are the third rail of American politics    the no fly zone. I actually    I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much  but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline  and upped it to six cents next year  nine cents the following year  all the way up to    cents by       that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption  and at the same time we would give people time to prepare  time to respond  and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time. Let me give you a little sense of how this would work. This is a gas receipt  hypothetically  for a year from now. The first thing that you have on the tax is    you have a tax for a stronger America       cents. So you're not helpless at the pump. And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign  very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack. And what it says is   The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates    cents in health care costs.  That's a lot. And so this    you can see that you're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax. And also  the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system. And at the same time  you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting  or a low interest loan on a different kind of car  or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence. With this whole sort of suite of policies  we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption    or our oil consumption    by    percent by     . So  three million barrels a day. But in order to do this  one of the things we really need to do  is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon. We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater  not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there. We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules. Thank you. So I work in marketing  which I love  but my first passion was physics  a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher  when I had a little less gray hair. So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us. And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing. So quick show of hands    who studied some marketing in university  Who studied some physics in university  Pretty good. And at school  Okay  lots of you. So  hopefully this will bring back some happy  or possibly some slightly disturbing memories. So  physics and marketing. We'll start with something very simple    Newton's Law   The force equals mass times acceleration.  This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign. But if we rearrange this formula quickly  we can get to acceleration equals force over mass  which means that for a larger particle    a larger mass    it requires more force to change its direction. It's the same with brands  the more massive a brand  the more baggage it has  the more force is needed to change its positioning. And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy. It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners  and why companies like Unilever and P G keep brands separate  like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand. So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction. The marketing is  the bigger a brand  the more difficult it is to reposition it. So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures. Now  who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle  Getting a little more technical now. So this says that it's impossible  by definition  to measure exactly the state    i.e.  the position    and the momentum of a particle  because the act of measuring it  by definition  changes it. So to explain that    if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it  then the photon of light has momentum  which knocks the particle  so you don't know where it was before you looked at it. By measuring it  the act of measurement changes it. The act of observation changes it. It's the same in marketing. So with the act of observing consumers  changes their behavior. Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group  and almost none of them buy lots of junk food. And yet  McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year. Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets  who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit  but don't shop like that any other day. And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web  it's very few. Yet  at Google  we know it's the number one searched for category. So luckily  the science    no  sorry    the marketing is getting easier. Luckily  with now better point of sale tracking  more digital media consumption  you can measure more what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they do. So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle  because the observation changes it. The marketing is    the message for marketing is    that try to measure what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do. So next  the scientific method    an axiom of physics  of all science    says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation  you can only disprove it. What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning  and it will strengthen it  but it will not conclusively prove it. And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water. So if we take an example    Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth. It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water. And there are parallels for marketing    you can invest for a long time in a brand  but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief. Take BP    they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand  but then one little accident. Think about Toyota. It was  for a long time  revered as the most reliable of cars  and then they had the big recall incident. And Tiger Woods  for a long time  the perfect brand ambassador. Well  you know the story. So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis  but it's easy to disprove it    any hypothesis is shaky. And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand  one bad week can undermine decades of good work. So be really careful to try and avoid the screw ups that can undermine your brand. And lastly  to the slightly obscure world of entropy    the second law of thermodynamics. This says that entropy  which is a measure of the disorder of a system  will always increase. The same is true of marketing. If we go back    years  the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand. But where we are today  things have changed. You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster. But then you lose control of it. With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer  it's impossible to control where it goes. Your brand starts being dispersed  it gets more chaotic. It's out of your control. I actually saw him speak    he did a good job. But while this may be unsettling for marketers  it's actually a good thing. This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people  more in with the people. It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force  which is ultimately good for your brand. So  the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase  it's a fundamental law. The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed. You can't fight it  so embrace it and find a way to work with it. So to close  my teacher  Mr. Vutter  told me that physics is cool  and hopefully  I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us  even in the world of marketing  something special. Thank you. Martin Luther King did not say   I have a nightmare   when he inspired the civil rights movements. He said   I have a dream.  And I have a dream. I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare  and this is going to be a challenge  because  if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times  nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic. I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times   The Road.  It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking  but everything is desolate  everything is dead. And just a father and son trying to survive  walking along the road. And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future. For too long  we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen. We have focused on the worst case scenario. We have focused on the problems. And we have not thought enough about the solutions. We've used fear  if you like  to grab people's attention. And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism. It's part of the fight and flight mechanism  that when an animal is frightened    think of a deer. A deer freezes very  very still  poised to run away. And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change. People are freezing and running away because we're using fear. And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is. What would it be like to be improving the human lot  And one of the problems that we face  I think  is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is  an economic definition of what progress is    that somehow  if we get the right numbers to go up  we're going to be better off  whether that's on the stock market  whether that's with GDP and economic growth  that somehow life is going to get better. This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear    that more is better. Come on. In the Western world  we have enough. Maybe some parts of the world don't  but we have enough. And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations. In fact  the architect of our national accounting system  Simon Kuznets  in the     s  said that   A nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income.  But we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff. And indeed  this is probably historical  and it had its time. In the second World War  we needed to produce a lot of stuff. And indeed  we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe  and we had to rebuild it afterwards. And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce. But as early as       this visionary man  Robert Kennedy  at the start of his ill fated presidential campaign  gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been. And he finished his talk with the phrase  that   The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile.  How crazy is that  That our measure of progress  our dominant measure of progress in society  is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile  I believe  if Kennedy was alive today  he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile. He'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice  sustainability and people's well being. And actually  social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world. This is from a global survey. It's asking people  what do they want. And unsurprisingly  people all around the world say that what they want is happiness  for themselves  for their families  their children  their communities. Okay  they think money is slightly important. It's there  but it's not nearly as important as happiness  and it's not nearly as important as love. We all need to love and be loved in life. It's not nearly as important as health. We want to be healthy and live a full life. These seem to be natural human aspirations. Why are statisticians not measuring these  Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms  instead of just how much stuff we have  And really  this is what I've done with my adult life    is think about how do we measure happiness  how do we measure well being  how can we do that within environmental limits. And we created  at the organization that I work for  the New Economics Foundation  something we call the Happy Planet Index  because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy. Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that  And what we do  is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens. That should be the goal of every nation on the planet. But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that  and that is how many of the planet's resources we use. We all have one planet. We all have to share it. It is the ultimate scarce resource  the one planet that we share. And economics is very interested in scarcity. When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome  it thinks in terms of efficiency. It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck. And this is a measure of how much well being we get for our planetary resource use. It is an efficiency measure. And probably the easiest way to show you that  is to show you this graph. Running horizontally along the graph  is  ecological footprint   which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet. More is bad. Running vertically upwards  is a measure called  happy life years.  It's about the well being of nations. It's like a happiness adjusted life expectancy. It's like quality and quantity of life in nations. And the yellow dot there you see  is the global average. Now  there's a huge array of nations around that global average. To the top right of the graph  are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well being  but they're using a lot of planet to get there. They are the U.S.A.  other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually. Conversely  at the bottom left of the graph  are countries that are not producing much well being    typically  sub Saharan Africa. In Hobbesian terms  life is short and brutish there. The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only    years. Malaria  HIV AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world. But now for the good news  There are some countries up there  yellow triangles  that are doing better than global average  that are heading up towards the top left of the graph. This is an aspirational graph. We want to be top left  where good lives don't cost the earth. They're Latin American. The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven't been to. Maybe some of you have. Costa Rica. Costa Rica    average life expectancy is    and a half years. That is longer than in the USA. They are  according to the latest Gallup world poll  the happiest nation on the planet    than anybody  more than Switzerland and Denmark. They are the happiest place. They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in  the  Western world    a quarter of the resources. What's going on there  What's happening in Costa Rica  We can look at some of the data.    percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources. Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by     . They abolished the army in             . And they invested in social programs    health and education. They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world. And they have that Latin vibe  don't they. They have the social connectedness. The challenge is  that possibly    and the thing we might have to think about    is that the future might not be North American  might not be Western European. It might be Latin American. And the challenge  really  is to pull the global average up here. That's what we need to do. And if we're going to do that  we need to pull countries from the bottom  and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph. And then we're starting to create a happy planet. That's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends. We don't have good data going back for every country in the world  but for some of the richest countries  the OECD group  we do. And this is the trend in well being over that time  a small increase  but this is the trend in ecological footprint. And so in strict happy planet methodology  we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to. And the point really is  is that I think  probably everybody in this room would like society to get to      without an apocalyptic something happening. It's actually not very long away. It's half a human lifetime away. A child entering school today will be my age in     . This is not the very distant future. This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like. And I put it to you  that is not business as usual. That is changing our business. That is changing the way we create our organizations  we do our government policy and we live our lives. And the point is  we need to carry on increasing well being. No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce. None of us  I think  want human progress to stop. I think we want it to carry on. I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing. And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in. I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing. They want to hold on to what they've got. And if we're going to engage them  I think that's what we've got to do. And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more. Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that  but the point is we need to turn those curves. And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory  systems engineers  where they create feedback loops  put the right information at the right point of time. Human beings are very motivated by the  now.  You put a smart meter in your home  and you see how much electricity you're using right now  how much it's costing you  your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly. What would that look like for society  Why is it  on the radio news every evening  I hear the FTSE      the Dow Jones  the dollar pound ratio    I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news. And why do I hear that  Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday  or American used yesterday  Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions  That's how you create a collective goal. You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it. And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well being At a government level  they might create national accounts of well being. At a business level  you might look at the well being of your employees  which we know is really linked to creativity  which is linked to innovation  and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues. At a personal level  we need these nudges too. Maybe we don't quite need the data  but we need reminders. In the U.K.  we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do    never my best thing. What are these for happiness  What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier  We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago  a big program called the Foresight program    lots and lots of people    involved lots of experts    everything evidence based    a huge tome. But a piece of work we did was on  what five positive actions can you do to improve well being in your life  And the point of these is they are  not quite  the secrets of happiness  but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from. And the first of these is to connect  is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life. Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do  and energy  Keep building them. The second one is be active. The fastest way out of a bad mood  step outside  go for a walk  turn the radio on and dance. Being active is great for our positive mood. The third one is take notice. How aware are you of things going on around the world  the seasons changing  people around you  Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge  Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness  cognitive behavioral therapy   very  strong for our well being. The fourth is keep learning and keep is important    learning throughout the whole life course. Older people who keep learning and are curious  they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down. But it doesn't have to be formal learning  it's not knowledge based. It's more curiosity. It can be learning to cook a new dish  picking up an instrument you forgot as a child. Keep learning. And the final one is that most anti economic of activities  but give. Our generosity  our altruism  our compassion  are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain. We feel good if we give. You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning. You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people. You measure their happiness at the end of the day  those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves. And these five ways  which we put onto these handy postcards  I would say  don't have to cost the earth. They don't have any carbon content. They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied. And so I think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth. Now  Martin Luther King  on the eve of his death  gave an incredible speech. He said   I know there are challenges ahead  there may be trouble ahead  but I fear no one. I don't care. I have been to the mountain top  and I have seen the Promised Land.  Now  he was a preacher  but I believe the environmental movement and  in fact  the business community  government  needs to go to the top of the mountain top  and it needs to look out  and it needs to see the Promised Land  or the land of promise  and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want. And not only that  we need to create a Great Transition to get there  and we need to pave that great transition with good things. Human beings want to be happy. Pave them with the five ways. And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them    something like the Happy Planet Index. And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want  where happiness does not cost the earth. We live on a human dominated planet  putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth. This is bad news  but perhaps surprising to you  it's also part of the good news. We're the first generation    thanks to science    to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it. It's also good news  because the planetary risks we're facing are so large  that business as usual is not an option. In fact  we're in a phase where transformative change is necessary  which opens the window for innovation  for new ideas and new paradigms. This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability. On this journey  I'd like to bring  apart from yourselves  a good friend  a stakeholder  who's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues  a stakeholder who refuses to compromise    planet Earth. So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage  to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey  which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past        years. This is the living conditions on the planet over the last         years. It's a very important period    it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet. We've had the same  roughly  abilities that developed civilizations as we know it. This is the environmental conditions on the planet. Here  used as a proxy  temperature variability. It was a jumpy ride.        years back in a crisis  we leave Africa  we colonize Australia in another crisis         years back  we leave Asia for Europe in another crisis         years back  and then we enter the remarkably stable Holocene phase  the only period in the whole history of the planet  that we know of  that can support human development. A thousand years into this period  we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns. We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today. The Mesopotamian culture  we invent agriculture  we domesticate animals and plants. You have the Roman  the Greek and the story as you know it. The only phase  as we know it that can support humanity. The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet  a quadruple sqeeze  which  as its first squeeze  has population growth of course. Now  this is not only about numbers  this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people committed to nine billion people  it's an equity issue as well. The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority  the    percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid   th century. The majority of the planet  aspiring for development  having the right for development  are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle  a momentous pressure. The second pressure on the planet is  of course the climate agenda    the big issue    where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at     ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees  to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  holding six meters    level rising  the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet  holding another seven meters    sea level rising. Now  you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet  a resilient planet  but unfortunately  the third pressure is the ecosystem decline. Never have we seen  in the past    years  such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet  one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term  in our forests  land and biodiversity. The forth pressure is surprise  the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm  that ecosystems behave linearly  predictably  controllably in our    so to say    linear systems  and that in fact  surprise is universal  as systems tip over very rapidly  abruptly and often irreversibly. This  dear friends  poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale. We may  in fact  have entered a new geological era    the Anthropocene  where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level. Now  as a scientist  what's the evidence for this  Well  the evidence is  unfortunately  ample. It's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change. You can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well being    nitrous oxide  methane  deforestation  overfishing land degredation  loss of species    they all show the same pattern over the past     years. Simultaneously  they branch off in the mid   s     years after the Second World War  showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid   s. You see  for the first time  an imprint on the global level. And I can tell you  you enter the disciplinary research in each of these  you find something remarkably important  the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves  that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet  the decade when we have to bend the curves. Now  as if this was not enough    to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet    we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states  separated by thresholds    illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram  where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system. Now  the system may gradually    under pressure of climate change  erosion  biodiversity loss    lose the depth of the cup  the resilience  but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly  under a threshold  be tipping over. Upff. Sorry. Changing state and literally ending up in an undesired situation  where new biophysical logic takes over  new species take over  and the system gets locked. Do we have evidence of this  Yes  coral reef systems. Biodiverse  low nutrient  hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing  unsustainable tourism  climate change. A trigger and the system tips over  loses its resilience  soft corals take over  and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development. The Arctic    a beautiful system    a regulating biome at the planetary level  taking the knock after knock on climate change  appearing to be in a good state. No scientist could predict that in       suddenly  what could be crossing a threshold. The system suddenly  very surprisingly  loses    to    percent of its summer ice cover. And the drama is  of course  that when the system does this  the logic may change. It may get locked in an undesired state  because it changes color  absorbs more energy  and the system may get stuck. In my mind  the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation. As a sideline  you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic to be able to control the oil resources. Now  if we have evidence  which we now have  that wetlands  forests   unclear  monsoon system  the rainforests  behave in this nonlinear way.    or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time   Do we have to put the planet into the the pot   So we have to ask ourselves  are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state  Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired  if now catastrophic  change for human development  You know  you don't want to stand there. In fact  you're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing  at the foaming  slippery waters at the threshold. In fact  there's a fence quite upstream of this threshold  beyond which you are in a danger zone. And this is the new paradigm  which we gathered two  three years back  recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future  aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts  is of the past. Now we to ask ourselves  which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene  And could we even  thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science  identify the thresholds  the points where we may expect nonlinear change  And could we even define a planetary boundary  a fence  within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity  This work  which was published in  Nature   late       after a number of years of analysis  led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which  under active stewardship  would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space. These include  of course  climate. It may surprise you that it's not only climate. But it shows that we are interconnected  among many systems on the planet  with the three big systems  climate change  stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems  where the scientific evidence of large scale thresholds in the paleo record of the history of the planet. But we also include  what we call  the slow variables  the systems that  under the hood  regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet    the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet  land use change  rate of biodiversity loss  freshwater use  functions which regulate biomass on the planet  carbon sequestration  diversity. And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify    air pollution  including warming gases and air polluting sulfates and nitrates  but also chemical pollution. Together  these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the Anthropocene  understanding that the planet is a complex self regulating system. In fact  most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three Musketeers   One for all. All for one.  You degrade forests  you go beyond the boundary on land  you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable. The drama here is  in fact  that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one  if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development. Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries. What you see here in black line is the safe operating space  the quantified boundaries  as suggested by this analysis. The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point  the pre industrial point  where we're very safely in the safe operating space. In the '  s  we start branching out. In the '  s already  through the green revolution and the Haber Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere    you know  human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole. We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '  s  actually  right after Rio. And today  we are in a situation where we estimate that we've transgressed three boundaries  the rate of biodiversity loss  which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity    one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs    nitrogen and climate change. But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others  but we are approaching fast on land  water  phosphorus and oceans. But this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity  to put the light on our  so far overpowered industrial vehicle  which operates as if we're only on a dark  straight highway. Now the question then is  how gloomy is this  Is then sustainable development utopia  Well  there's no science to suggest. In fact  there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change  that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative  a transformative gear  across scales. The drama is  of course  is that     countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction. But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm  from the current linear  command and control thinking  looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible  a much more adaptive approach  where we recognize that redundancy  both in social and environmental systems  is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change. We have to invest in persistence  in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup. We have to invest in transformations capability  moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis  and of course to adapt to unavoidable change. This is a new paradigm. We're not doing that at any scale on governance. But is it happening anywhere  Do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level  Well  yes  in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer. There's good news here  for example  from Latin America  where plow based farming systems of the '  s and '  s led farming basically to a dead end  with lower and lower yields  degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay  Uruguay and a number of countries  Brazil  leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies  which today  for example  in some countries  have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch  zero till farming which  not only produces more food  but also sequesters carbon. The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story. Under the realization from tourist operators  fishermen  the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime. Global change  beautification rack culture  overfishing and unsustainable tourism  all together placing this system in the realization of crisis. But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset  which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience  acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole  and then allow for much more redundancy in the system. Sweden  the country I come from  has other examples  where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as    as in many countries    as flood prone polluted nuisance in the peri urban regions. But again  a crisis  new partnerships  actors locally  transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning. So crisis leading into opportunities. Now  what about the future  Well  the future  of course  has one massive challenge  which is feeding a world of nine billion people. We need nothing less than a new green revolution  and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink. It has to basically do this on current land. We cannot expand anymore  because it erodes the planetary boundaries. We cannot continue consuming water as we do today  with    percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean. And we need a transformation. Well  interestingly  and based on my work and others in Africa  for example  we've shown that even the most vulnerable small scale rainfall farming systems  with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts  sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers' fields  and innovations in tillage systems  we can triple  quadruple  yield levels on current land. Elinor Ostrom  the latest Nobel laureate of economics  clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust  local  action based partnerships and cross scale institutional innovations  where local actors  together  can deal with the global commons at a large scale. But even on the hard policy area we have innovations. We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low carbon economy in record time. And what shall we do  Everybody talks about carbon taxes    it won't work    emission schemes  but for example  one policy measure  feed in tariffs on the energy system  which is already applied  from China doing it on offshore wind systems  all the way to the U.S. where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy  but you can subsidize electricity to poor people. You get people out of poverty. You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector  while at the same time  stimulating innovation    examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level. So there is    no doubt    opportunity here  and we can list many  many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet. The key though in all of these  the red thread  is the shift in mindset  moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future  where we instead backcast our future  and we say   What is the playing field on the planet  What are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate   and then backtrack innovations within that. But of course  the drama is  it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option. So  there is scientific evidence. They sort of say the harsh news  that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization. In fact  what we have to do over the next    years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we're in today. Now  science indicates that  yes  we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space  if we move simultaneously  collaborating on a global level  from local to global scale  in transformative options  which build resilience on a finite planet. Thank you. Tyler Dewar  The way I feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what I wanted to say. And it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness. TD  But maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all  I could share with you a little story about myself. TD  From the time I was very young  onward  I was given a lot of different responsibilities  and it always seemed to me  when I was young  that everything was laid out before me. All of the plans for me were already made. I was given the clothes that I needed to wear and told where I needed to be  given these very precious and holy looking robes to wear  with the understanding that it was something sacred or important. TD  But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me  I was living in eastern Tibet with my family. And when I was seven years old  all of a sudden  a search party arrived at my home. They were looking the next Karmapa  and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad  and the news came to me that they were telling me that I was the Karmapa. And these days  people ask me a lot  how did that feel. How did that feel when they came and whisked you away  and your lifestyle completely changed  And what I mostly say is that  at that time  it was a pretty interesting idea to me. I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with. TD  But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining  as I thought it would have been. I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment. And immediately  a lot of different responsibilities  in terms of my education and so forth  were heaped upon me. I was separated  largely  from my family  including my mother and father. I didn't have have many personal friends to spend time with  but I was expected to perform these prescribed duties. So it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa wasn't going to come true. It more felt to be the case to me that I was being treated like a statue  and I was to sit in one place like a statue would. TD  Nevertheless  I felt that  even though I've been separated from my loved ones    and  of course  now I'm even further away. When I was     I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father  my relatives  my friends and my homeland. But nevertheless  there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart  in terms of the love that I feel for these people. I feel  still  a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land. TD  And I still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father  albeit infrequently. I talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone. And my experience is that  when I'm talking to her  with every second that passes during our conversation  the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together. TD  So those were just a few remarks about my personal background. And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you  in terms of ideas  I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this  where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together  exchange their ideas and form relationships of friendship with each other. And I think that's symbolic of what we're seeing in the world in general  that the world is becoming smaller and smaller  and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection. That's wonderful  but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside. Along with outward development and increase of opportunity  there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections. So we spoke and we heard some about design this week. I think that it's important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the endeavor of the design of the heart. We heard a lot about technology this week  and it's important for us to remember to invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart. TD  So  even though I'm somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world  still  I feel a sense of impediment  when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart to heart  or a mind to mind  level. I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way. TC  My relationship to this concept of heart to heart connection  or mind to mind connection  is an interesting one  because  as a spiritual leader  I'm always attempting to open my heart to others and offer myself up for heart to heart and mind to mind connections in a genuine way with other people  but at the same time  I've always been advised that I need to emphasize intelligence over the heart to heart connections  because  being someone in a position like mine  if I don't rely primarily on intelligence  then something dangerous may happen to me. So it's an interesting paradox at play there. But I had a really striking experience once  when a group from Afghanistan came to visit me  and we had a really interesting conversation. TD  So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas  which  as you know  were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan. But the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the Muslim and Buddhist traditions. Of course  in Muslim  because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry  you don't find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the Buddhist tradition  where  of course  there are many statues of the Buddha that are highly revered. So  we were talking about the differences between the traditions and what many people perceived as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas  but I offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way. What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the depletion of matter  some solid substance falling down and disintegrating. Maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the Berlin Wall  where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication. So I think that  in this way  it's always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better. TD  So  with regard to the development that we've been talking about here at this conference  I really feel that the development that we make shouldn't create a further burden for us as human beings  but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we live in the world. TD  Of course  I rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of India  the great country of India  but at the same time  I think  as some of us have acknowledged  we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand. So  as we are climbing the tree  some of the things that we're doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree's very root. And so  what I think it comes down to is a question of  not only having information of what's going on  but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive. We have hear  this week  about the horrible sufferings  for example  that so many women of the world are enduring day to day. We have that information  but what often happens to us is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it. We don't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts. So I think the way forward for the world    one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness    is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart. TD  So I think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well being  or deep sense of well being as humans  and I think that means sinking in to whatever it is you're doing now. Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world  sink into that  get a full taste of that. TD  So  since we've been here this week  we've taken millions of breaths  collectively  and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives  but we often miss the very subtle changes. And I think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us  but that  if we pay attention  we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take. TD  So  every one of you who has come here is so talented  and you have so much to offer to the world  I think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this conference  the momentum  the positivity  and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world. His Holiness the Karmapa  Tomorrow is my Talk. TD  Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard  even in inviting me  let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen  and I was somewhat resistant at times  and I was also very nervous throughout this week. I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth  and people would ask me  why. I would tell them   It's because I have to talk tomorrow.  And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that  but I very much appreciate the opportunity she's given me to be here. And to you  everyone  thank you very much. HH  Thank you very much. Everyone  please think of your biggest personal goal. For real    you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal  okay  Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations  and their high image of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud  Don't you feel one step closer already  like it's already becoming part of your identity  Well  bad news  you should have kept your mouth shut  because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal  there are some steps that need to be done  some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it  psychologists have found that it's called a  social reality.  The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then because you've felt that satisfaction  you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So this goes against conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals  right  So they hold us to it. So  let's look at the proof.       Kurt Lewin  founder of social psychology  called this  substitution.        Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others  it felt real in the mind.       Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this  and in       he did some new tests that were published. It goes like this      people across four separate tests. Everyone wrote down their personal goal. Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room  and half didn't. Then everyone was given    minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal  but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now  those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire    minutes on average  and when asked afterward  said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal. But those who had announced it quit after only    minutes  on average  and when asked afterward  said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal. So if this is true  what can we do  Well  you could resist the temptation to announce your goal. You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings  and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing. But if you do need to talk about something  you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction  such as   I really want to run this marathon  so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't  okay   So audience  next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal  what will you say  Exactly  Well done. This strange looking plant is called the Llareta. What looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches  each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it. This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile  and it happens to be       years old. It also happens to be a relative of parsley. For the past five years  I've been researching  working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are       years old and older. The project is part art and part science. There's an environmental component. And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale. I selected       years as my minimum age because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there. What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi  living on the remote island of Yakushima. The tree was in part a catalyst for the project. I'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph  and then I heard about this tree that is       years old and knew that I had to go visit it. It wasn't until later  when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project. So it was the slow churn  if you will. I think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art  science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on. So I started researching  and to my surprise  this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences. And    perhaps naively    I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity. So what you're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum  or map lichen  and this is around       years old and lives in Greenland  which is a long way to go for some lichens. Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north. It was very primal and more remote than anything I'd ever experienced before. And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences. One was when I had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord  only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found. And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e mail  so I was literally left to my own devices. But luckily  it worked out obviously  but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected. And then a few days later  we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite  where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot long trout with your bare hands. It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet. And then  of course  there's the lichens. These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years. I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective. And what you're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon. And if the title  Searching for Armillaria Death Rings   sounds ominous  it is. The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus  killing certain species of trees in the forest. It's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the  humongous fungus  because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well. So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus  I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings  the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees. So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo  but I do know the fungus is down there. And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree. So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus  and what it's doing    it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients. So this strategy has served it pretty well    it's       years old. And then from underground to underwater. This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that's around       years old. And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one. This is at about    feet or    meters  depth. And you'll see  there's some damage to the surface of the coral. That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it  though luckily  they lost interest before killing it. Luckily still  it seems to be out of harm's way of the recent oil spill. But that being said  we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet  and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen. Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet. This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees  living in Utah  that is literally        years old. What looks like a forest is actually only one tree. Imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system. So what you have is one giant  interconnected  genetically identical individual that's been living for        years. It also happens to be male and  in theory immortal. This is a clonal tree as well. This is the spruce Gran Picea  which at       years is a mere babe in the woods. The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection. I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree  and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change. As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain  the vegetation zone is actually changing. So we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them. This is the Fortingall Yew    no  I'm just kidding    this is the Fortingall Yew. But I put that slide in there because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project. And aside from coral  the answer is no. Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is    any guesses  Rachel Sussman       No      is the oldest living tortoise  so nowhere near      . And then  you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached     years old. However  it died in the lab as they were determining its age. The most interesting discovery of late  I think is the so called immortal jellyfish  which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity. So that being said  it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild. And back to the yew here. So as you can see  it's in a churchyard  it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall. And there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the U.K.  but if you do the math  you'll remember it's actually the yew trees that were there first  then the churches. And now down to another part of the world. I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa with an expert in Baobab trees. And we saw a number of them  and this is most likely the oldest. It's around        and it's called the Sagole Baobab. And you know  I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests. They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves  and they also contain records of natural and human events. And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this. You can see that this one has names carved into its trunk  but it also records some natural events. So the Baobabs  as they get older  tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out. And this can create great natural shelters for animals  but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses  including a bar  a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree. And this brings me to another favorite of mine    I think  because it is just so unusual. This plant is called the Welwitschia  and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola  where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea. And what's more  it's actually a tree. It's a primitive conifer. You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center. And what looks like two big heaps of leaves  is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time. And it actually never sheds those leaves  so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom. I spoke to a biologist at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from  and his thought was that if you travel around Namibia  you see that there are a number of petrified forests  and the logs are all    the logs are all giant coniferous trees  and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from. So his thought was that flooding in the north of Africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago  and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment. This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things. This is something called an underground forest. So  I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden  who explained that certain species of trees have adapted to this region. It's bushfelt region  which is dry and prone to a lot of fires  as so what these trees have done is  if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree  and that this is ground level  imagine that the whole thing  that whole bulk of the tree  migrated underground  and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface. That way  when a fire roars through  it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed. The tree can easily recover. These also tend to grow clonally  the oldest of which is        years old. Back in the U.S.  there's a couple plants of similar age. This is the clonal Creosote bush  which is around        years old. If you've been in the American West  you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous  but that being said  you see that this has this unique  circular form. And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape. And it's one    again  that interconnected root system  making it one genetically identical individual. It also has a friend nearby    well  I think they're friends. This is the clonal Mojave yucca  it's about a mile away  and it's a little bit older than        years. And you see it has that similar circular form. And there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it. And both of these  the yucca and the Creosote bush  live on Bureau of Land Management land  and that's very different from being protected in a national park. In fact  this land is designated for recreational all terrain vehicle use. So  now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet. This is Siberian Actinobacteria  which is between         and         years old. This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours. And what they found  by doing research into the permafrost  was this bacteria. But what's unique about it is that it's doing DNA repair below freezing. And what that means is that it's not dormant    it's actually been living and growing for half a million years. It's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things  because if the permafrost melts  it won't survive. This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things  so you can get a sense of where they are  you see they're all over the world. The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed  and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to. You'll see also  there's a flag on Antarctica. I'm trying to travel there to find       year old moss  which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula. So  I probably have about two more years left on this project    on this phase of the project  but after five years  I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work. The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past  a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future. They've survived for millennia in desert  in the permafrost  at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean. They've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments  but now some of them are in jeopardy  and they can't just get up and get out of the way. It's my hope that  by going to find these organisms  that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future. Thank you. Well  that's kind of an obvious statement up there. I started with that sentence about    years ago  and I started in the context of developing countries  but you're sitting here from every corner of the world. So if you think of a map of your country  I think you'll realize that for every country on Earth  you could draw little circles to say   These are places where good teachers won't go.  On top of that  those are the places from where trouble comes. So we have an ironic problem    good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most. I started in      to try and address this problem with an experiment  which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi. I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi. The children barely went to school  they didn't know any English    they'd never seen a computer before  and they didn't know what the internet was. I connected high speed internet to it    it's about three feet off the ground    turned it on and left it there. After this  we noticed a couple of interesting things  which you'll see. But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do. This is the first experiment that we did    eight year old boy on your right teaching his student  a six year old girl  and he was teaching her how to browse. This boy here in the middle of central India    this is in a Rajasthan village  where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process  they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly. They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time. In another South Indian village  these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee. They downloaded it from Disney.com  or one of these websites     days after putting the computer in their village. So at the end of it  we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own  irrespective of who or where they were. At that point  I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer. We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad  India  where I gave a group of children    they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent. I gave them a computer with a speech to text interface  which you now get free with Windows  and asked them to speak into it. So when they spoke into it  the computer typed out gibberish  so they said   Well  it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying.  So I said   Yeah  I'll leave it here for two months. Make yourself understood to the computer.  So the children said   How do we do that.  And I said   I don't know  actually.  And I left. Two months later    and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal    that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech to text synthesizer. In other words  they were all speaking like James Tooley. So they could do that on their own. After that  I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own. I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo  from the late Arthur C. Clarke  who said   I want to see what's going on.  And he couldn't travel  so I went over there. He said two interesting things   A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be.  The second thing he said was that   If children have interest  then education happens.  And I was doing that in the field  so every time I would watch it and think of him. help people  because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them. And when you've got interest  then you have education. Sugata Mitra  I took the experiment to South Africa. This is a    year old boy. like animals  and I listen to music. SM  And I asked him   Do you send emails   And he said   Yes  and they hop across the ocean.  This is in Cambodia  rural Cambodia    a fairly silly arithmetic game  which no child would play inside the classroom or at home. They would  you know  throw it back at you. They'd say   This is very boring.  If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away  then they will show off with each other about what they can do. This is what these children are doing. They are trying to multiply  I think. And all over India  at the end of about two years  children were beginning to Google their homework. As a result  the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English    rapid improvement and all sorts of things. They said   They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth. And indeed they had. I mean  if there's stuff on Google  why would you need to stuff it into your head  So at the end of the next four years  I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own. At that time  a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India. So Newcastle gave me a call. I said   I'll do it from Delhi.  They said   There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds worth of University money sitting in Delhi.  So in       I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle. I wanted to test the limits of the system. The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India. And I set myself and impossible target  can Tamil speaking    year old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own  And I thought  I'll test them  they'll get a zero    I'll give the materials  I'll come back and test them    they get another zero  I'll go back and say   Yes  we need teachers for certain things.  I called in    children. They all came in there  and I told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer. I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything. It's all in English  and I'm going. So I left them with it. I came back after two months  and the    children marched in looking very  very quiet. I said   Well  did you look at any of the stuff   They said   Yes  we did.   Did you understand anything    No  nothing.  So I said   Well  how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing   They said   We look at it every day.  So I said   For two months  you were looking at stuff you didn't understand   So a    year old girl raises her hand and says  literally   Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease  we've understood nothing else.  It took me three years to publish that. It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology. One of the referees who refereed the paper said   It's too good to be true   which was not very nice. Well  one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher. And then that's her over there. Remember  they don't study English. I edited out the last bit when I asked   Where is the neuron   and she says   The neuron  The neuron   and then she looked and did this. Whatever the expression  it was not very nice. So their scores had gone up from zero to    percent  which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances. But    percent is not a pass. So I found that they had a friend  a local accountant  a young girl  and they played football with her. I asked that girl   Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass   And she said   How would I do that  I don't know the subject.  I said   No  use the method of the grandmother.  She said   What's that   I said   Well  what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time. Just say to them  'That's cool. That's fantastic. What is that  Can you do that again  Can you show me some more '  She did that for two months. The scores went up to     which is what the posh schools of New Delhi  with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting. So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious. So  having experimented in all sorts of remote places  I came to the most remote place that I could think of. Approximately       miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead. In Gateshead  I took    children and I started to fine tune the method. I made them into groups of four. I said   You make your own groups of four. Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers.  Remember  from the Hole in the Wall.  You can exchange groups. You can walk across to another group  if you don't like your group  etc. You can go to another group  peer over their shoulders  see what they're doing  come back to you own group and claim it as your own work.  And I explained to them that  you know  a lot of scientific research is done using that method. The children enthusiastically got after me and said   Now  what do you want us to do   I gave them six GCSE questions. The first group    the best one    solved everything in    minutes. The worst  in   . They used everything that they knew    news groups  Google  Wikipedia  Ask Jeeves  etc. The teachers said   Is this deep learning   I said   Well  let's try it. I'll come back after two months. We'll give them a paper test    no computers  no talking to each other  etc.  The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was    percent. When I did the experiment  when I did the test  after two months  the score was    percent. There was photographic recall inside the children  I suspect because they're discussing with each other. A single child in front of a single computer will not do that. I have further results  which are almost unbelievable  of scores which go up with time. Because their teachers say that after the session is over  the children continue to Google further. Here in Britain  I put out a call for British grandmothers  after my Kuppam experiment. Well  you know  they're very vigorous people  British grandmothers.     of them volunteered immediately. The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time  sitting in their homes  one day in a week. So they did that  and over the last two years  over     hours of instruction has happened over Skype  using what my students call the granny cloud. The granny cloud sits over there. I can beam them to whichever school I want to. You say it. You can't catch me. Children  You can't catch me. Teacher  I'm the gingerbread man. Children  I'm the gingerbread man. Teacher  Well done. Very good ... SM  Back at Gateshead  a    year old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in    minutes. You know  stuff which I don't know anything about. Two children watch a TEDTalk. They wanted to be footballers before. After watching eight TEDTalks  he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci. It's pretty simple stuff. This is what I'm building now    they're called SOLEs  Self Organized Learning Environments. The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big  powerful screens  big broadband connections  but in groups. If they want  they can call the granny cloud. This is a SOLE in Newcastle. The mediator is from Pune  India. So how far can we go  One last little bit and I'll stop. I went to Turin in May. I sent all the teachers away from my group of    year old students. I speak only English  they speak only Italian  so we had no way to communicate. I started writing English questions on the blackboard. The children looked at it and said   What   I said   Well  do it.  They typed it into Google  translated it into Italian  went back into Italian Google. Fifteen minutes later    next question  where is Calcutta  This one  they took only    minutes. I tried a really hard one then. Who was Pythagoras  and what did he do  There was silence for a while  then they said   You've spelled it wrong. It's Pitagora.  And then  in    minutes  the right angled triangles began to appear on the screens. This sent shivers up my spine. These are    year olds. Text  In another    minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then  SM  So you know what's happened  I think we've just stumbled across a self organizing system. A self organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside. Self organizing systems also always show emergence  which is that the system starts to do things  which it was never designed for. Which is why you react the way you do  because it looks impossible. I think I can make a guess now    education is self organizing system  where learning is an emergent phenomenon. It'll take a few years to prove it  experimentally  but I'm going to try. But in the meanwhile  there is a method available. One billion children  we need     million mediators    there are many more than that on the planet       million SOLEs      billion dollars and    years. We could change everything. Thanks. The moment I say  school   so many memories come back to me. It's like after every exam  when I walk out  the teacher would say   Hey  come. How did you do   I would say with a great smile   I will definitely pass.  And I didn't understand why  in one hand they say   Speak the truth   in the other hand  when you say the truth  they hated you. So it went on like that  and I didn't know where else to find myself. So I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from  the  Unknown because  for some reason  I couldn't believe what my father and mother hanged in the Puja room as a god  because my friend's family had something else as a god. So I thought   I guess I'll pray to  the  Unknown and ask help   and started getting help from everywhere  each and every corner of my life at that time. My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting. Then  when I was in eighth standard around    years old  I started working in a part time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu. And then school also started supporting me.  Oh  he's bad at studies  but let him send to the drawing competitions.  So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school. And one of those competitions  I just won a small  little transistor Philips radio. And I didn't have the patience to wait until I reached home. So I just switched on in the train  loudly. If you travel in Indian trains  you can see people listening to radio and  you know  even from their mobiles. So at that time    and I was       and I was listening to just radio  and someone happened to sit next to me  like these three people are sitting here. You know  like just adjacent to me. He just started asking   Where did you buy the radio  How much is it   I said   It's a prize from  an  art competition.  And he said   Oh  I teach at a college of arts. I think you should study in a school of art. You just quit school and come there.  So  why I'm telling you this  you know  maybe  you know  whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life    it's possible. It is that we need we need to be open and fine tuned. So that's what made me enter  the  college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work  or art and finally I'm here in front of you. When I look back  you know  on what happened between that time and now here    the last       years    I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects  but it was not intentional. And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking   What really makes us      you know  it's actually  the  past  what makes a person. So I was thinking  but when you look at the past  the way to understand the past is only by the traces available  because we cannot go back  to  the past. It can be ruins  or it can be music  or it can be painting or drawing or writing  whatever it is. But it is just a kind of trace of that time. And that fascinated me  to explore that territory. So I was working on the line  but instead of working about traces  I started capturing traces. So here are some of the works I would like to show you. So this is called  Self In Progress.  It's just a trace of being in this body. So here  what happened then  you know    what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself. It's almost like a  D photograph. So there is an element of performance  and there is an element of sculpture  and there is an element of feeling one's self  so close to one's self. So it's almost like fossils for the future. And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces. So this is what I was talking about  while molding  it's such a great experience  because we have freedom of like walking  or moving my hand or  moving around in the space  but the moment this becomes solid  when you cannot move even an inch  because this is plaster of Paris  so the moment you pour it it's like liquid  but after    minutes  it's almost like a hard stone. So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because  knowingly or unknowingly  whatever we do  you know  we leave our traces here. So I just thought   I'm going to capture thumbprint  footprint  or whatever traces we leave as humans.  This is the trace of fire  this is the trace of sun. Because when I was capturing traces  you know  this thought comes to me always  is it  only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace  or is there other ways to capture it   So this work is nothing but like    because of the focal length of the lens  it just shows what is on the other side. So I just put the paper on the focal length  which was an etching print  then I got the portrait of  the  sun from sunlight. This is called  Dawn to Dawn.  What I did here  I just put like    feet  of  paper then put a coconut rope  and just burnt it. So it took about    hours to get this line. So wherever the fire is eating the paper  that's what becomes the work    detail. Even though we have traces when we try to understand them  the perception and context play a major role to understand it. So do we really understand what it is  or are we trying to get what we think it is  Then move towards questioning the perception because  even though there are traces  when you try to understand them  you know you play a major role. So like let's say even a simple act. How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore  Can you just raise the hand  If you just ask an opinion of how  everyone can interpret it. Like  let's say  if a schoolteacher says  she'll simply say   To get to the other side.  Why the cow was crossing the road  you know. The answer can be so different if Potter said it. He would say   For the greater good.  Martin Luther King would say   I imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road  without having their motives called into question.  Imagine Moses comes now  and he sees the same cow walking around the street. He would definitely say   God came down from heaven  and he said unto the cow  'Thou shalt cross the road.' And cow crossed the road  and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow.  Freud would say   The fact that you're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.  If we ask Einstein  he would say   Whether the cow crossed the road  or the road moved underneath the cow  depends on your frame of reference.  Or Buddha    if he saw the same cow  he would say   Asking this question denies your own nature  as a  cow.  So  what we see is just what we think often  and most of the time  we don't see what it is. It just all depends on one's perception. And context  what is really context  You know  I could just show you this little piece of paper. Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist. The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist. It's just created by the mind. If you look at this piece of paper  this is the breadth and this is called length. This is how we've been taught in school. But if you tear it in the middle    now  I didn't touch this breadth  but still  the meaning of this changes. So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there  it's on the other side  even when we say dark  light  good  bad  tall  short    all meaning it doesn't exist in reality. It's just that being a human  the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning. So this work from this period is mostly like    you know  this is a work called  Light Makes Dark.  It's just captured through from the lamp. So the lamp is not just giving a light  it's also giving a darkness. So this is a work of art  which is just trying to explore that. This is called  Limit Out.  This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch    do we really see  This is an exact negative. It's about six inches deep in the wall  but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall. You know the wall is almost like    this is the first skin  and this is the second  and there's a third  and each creates a meaning. And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery. Again   Inward Out.  It's a full figure cast from myself. It's about eight inches deep. When I was doing that  I always wondered since I've worked with creators    and now you know  I've moved to questioning the perception    whenever I see the bird flying in the sky  it just makes me feel like  is there anything behind  are there any traces up there  which as a human  we don't see them  Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art  I couldn't find it. But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six  seven months  in the restroom  when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor. It's called Odonil. This is the work I made out of that material. The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting  because I wrote to Balsara  who produces that air freshener called Odonil  saying   Dear Sir  I am an artist. This is my catalogue. Will you help me to make this sculpture   They never wrote back to me. Then I thought   I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help.  So I told them   I'd like to start an air freshener company.  They said   Of course. This is the fee for the project report  and we will give you all the details   and they gave. Finally  I went back to them and said   It's not for starting the company  it's just to make my own work. Please come for the show.  And they did. And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi. In India  nobody really talks about works of art  they always talk about the appreciation of art. You buy this for       rupees  it'll become        in two months. This is the craft that was going on  but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate. And this was collected by Anupam    which is like  finally in the end  he will not have anything  because it will evaporate. So this is after a few weeks  this is after a few months. It's just all about questioning the preconceptions. So if someone says   Oh  I see the portrait   it may not be the portrait after a few months. And if they say it's solid  it will not be solid  it will evaporate. And if they say they don't get it  that's also not true  because it's in the air. It's in the same gallery or in the same museum. So they inhaled it  but they are not aware of it. While I was doing that work  my mom and my dad  they were looking at it and they said   Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time   And I was like   What do you mean    Light makes dark and now evaporating self. Don't you think it remained something about death   they said.  Of course not. For me   I'm thinking   this is tucked in some small solid  but the moment it evaporates  it's merged with the whole.  But she said   No. Still  I don't like it. Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor   I said   No  mom. It can't be. Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together  or we can break the sculpture and get the dust  but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe.  So  I did this work for her. It's called  Emerging Angel.  This is the first day    it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other. So  the same sculpture after a few days. This is after       days. Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood  the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one. This gave me a greater faith. That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture  the  invisible. So what you see now is called  Shadow Foreshadow.  And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow  and we don't see light too  we see the source of the light. We see where it's bouncing  but we don't see  them  as they exist. You know  that's why the night sky  we see the sky as dark  but it's filled with light all the time. When it's bounced on the moon  we see it. The same thing in the darkroom. The little dust particle will again  reflect the light  and we realize the existence of light. So we don't see dark  we don't see light  we don't see gravity  we don't see electricity. So  I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there. Because  as a visual artist  if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that    but how to sculpt this  you know  If we sculpt this  this has two reference points. The skin of this is also representing this. And skin at the other end also represents the floor. I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow. So this is a corrugated box and its shadow. Then the second one    the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence. So that produced a shadow. Then I thought  okay  let me sculpt that. Then  again  that becomes an object. Again  throwing light  then the third one. So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow. And then again  at that point  there is no shadow. I thought   Oh  good. Work is finished.  You can see the detail. This is called  Gravity.  It's called  Breath.  It's just two holes on the gallery wall. It's a false wall  which contains like     cubic feet. So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in. So where it's happening  we can see  but what is happening will remain invisible only. This is from the show called  Invisible   at Talwar Gallery. This is called  Kaayam.  Detail. And what I'd like to tell you  our senses are so limited    we cannot hear everything  we cannot see everything. We don't feel   I am touching the air   but if the breeze is a little more faster  then I can feel it. So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses. So my request was like  is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign  And to really get to the point  we should move beyond  you know  go to the other side of the wall  like illogic  like are invisible. Because when we see someone walks  we see the footprint. But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it  you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints  and the footprints are nothing but passing time. Thank you. My story is a little bit about war. It's about disillusionment. It's about death. And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage. And perhaps also  there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed up  fragmenting and dangerous world of the   st century. I don't believe in straightforward narratives. I don't believe in a life or history written as decision  A  led to consequence  B  led to consequence  C     these neat narratives that we're presented with  and that perhaps we encourage in each other. I believe in randomness  and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random. I'm colorblind. I was born unable to see most colors. This is why I wear gray and black most of the time  and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes. And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy. I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside. And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot. And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot  and sure enough  I failed. I couldn't see all the blinking different lights  and I can't distinguish color. So I had to choose another career  and this was in fact relatively easy for me  because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood  which was international relations. As a child  I read the newspaper thoroughly. I was fascinated by the Cold War  by the INF negotiations over intermediate range nuclear missiles  the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. in Angola or Afghanistan. These things really interested me. And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat. And I  one day  I announced this to my parents    and my father denies this story to this day    I said   Daddy  I want to be a diplomat.  And he turned to me  and he said   Carne  you have to be very clever to be a diplomat.  And my ambition was sealed. In       I entered the British Foreign Service. That year        people applied to become a diplomat  and    of us succeeded. And as those numbers suggest  I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world. Being a diplomat  then and now  is an incredible job  and I loved every minute of it    I enjoyed the status of it. I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events. I traveled to the Gaza Strip. I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry. I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary. I met Yasser Arafat. I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N. Later  I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. And I would travel in a C     transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan  surrounded by my Special Forces escort  who  themselves  had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines  because it was so dangerous. And that was exciting    that was fun. It was really interesting. And it's a great cadre of people  incredibly close knit community of people. And the pinnacle of my career  as it turned out  was when I was posted to New York. I'd already served in Germany  Norway  various other places  but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation. And my responsibility was the Middle East  which was my specialty. And there  I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process  the Lockerbie issue    we can talk about that later  if you wish    but above all  my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons. I was the chief British negotiator on the subject  and I was steeped in the issue. And anyway  my tour    it was kind of a very exciting time. I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy. We went through several wars during my time in New York. I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the   th of September      condemning the attacks of the day before  which were  of course  deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time. So it was kind of the best of time  worst of times kind of experience. I lived the high life. Although I worked very long hours  I lived in a penthouse in Union Square. I was a single British diplomat in New York City  you can imagine what that might have meant. I had a good time. But in       when my tour came to an end  I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London. I decided to take a sabbatical  in fact  at the New School  Bruce. In some inchoate  inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work  with me. I was exhausted  and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on. And I decided to take some time out from work. The Foreign Office was very generous. You could take these special unpaid leave  as they called them  and yet remain part of the diplomatic service  but not actually do any work. It was nice. And eventually  I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo  which was then under U.N. administration. And two things happened in Kosovo  which kind of  again  shows the randomness of life  because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage. But they were random things. One was that  in the summer of       the British government  somewhat reluctantly  decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War  a very limited subject. And I testified to that inquiry in secret. I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD  and my testimony to the inquiry said three things  that the government exaggerated the intelligence  which was very clear in all the years I'd read it. And indeed  our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors  let alone to us. Secondly  the government had ignored all available alternatives to war  which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still. The third reason  I won't go into. But anyway  I gave that testimony  and that presented me with a crisis. What was I going to do  This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues  of my ministers  who had  in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood. And so I was in crisis. And this wasn't a pretty thing. I moaned about it  I hesitated  I went on and on and on to my long suffering wife  and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service. I felt    there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie  The Insider   which you may know  where he goes back to CBS after they've let him down over the tobacco guy  and he goes   You know  I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken.  And it was like that for me. I love that movie. I felt just something's broken. I can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them. So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff. And it was a very  very uncomfortable  unpleasant feeling. And I started to fall. And today  that fall hasn't stopped  I'm still falling. But  in a way  I've got used to the sensation of it. And in a way  I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff  wondering what to do. A second thing happened in Kosovo  which kind of    I need a quick gulp of water  forgive me. A second thing happened in Kosovo  which kind of delivered the answer  which I couldn't really answer  which is   What do I do with my life   I love diplomacy    I have no career    I expected my entire life to be a diplomat  to be serving my country. I wanted to be an ambassador  and my mentors  my heroes  people who got to the top of my profession  and here I was throwing it all away. A lot of my friends were still in it. My pension was in it. And I gave it up. And what was I going to do  And that year  in Kosovo  this terrible  terrible thing happened  which I saw. In March       there were terrible riots all over the province    as it then was    of Kosovo.    people were killed. It was anarchy. And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy  to know that the police and the military    there were lots of military troops there    actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street. And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing. And that is not a very nice feeling to see  and I saw it. And I went through it. I went through those mobs. And with my Albanian friends  we tried to stop it  but we failed. And that riot taught me something  which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story. But one of the reasons that riot took place    those riots  which went on for several days  took place    was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future. There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then  and the Kosovo government  let alone the Kosovo people  were not actually participating in those talks. There was this whole fancy diplomatic system  this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo  and the Kosovars weren't part of it. And funnily enough  they were frustrated about that. Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration. It wasn't the only reason  and life is not simple  one reason narratives. It was a complicated thing  and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was. But that was one of the reasons. And that kind of gave me the inspiration    or rather to be precise  it gave my wife the inspiration. She said   Why don't you advise the Kosovars  Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy   And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service. They were not allowed diplomats. They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process  which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo. And so that was the idea. That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat  the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non profit to boot. And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo. I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him   Look  I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy. I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you   And he raised his glass of raki to me and said   Yes  Carne. Come.  And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government. Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi party negotiation team of Kosovo. And Kosovo became independent. Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world  and we're advising seven or eight different countries  or political groups  depending on how you wish to define them    and I'm not big on definitions. We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island. We're advising the Burmese opposition  the government of Southern Sudan  which    you heard it here first    is going to be a new country within the next few years. We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara  who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after    years of dispossession. We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations  which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen. There's a bit of randomness here too because  when I was beginning Independent Diplomat  I went to a party in the House of Lords  which is a ridiculous place  but I was holding my drink like this  and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me. And we started talking  and he said    I told him what I was doing  and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York. At that time there was just me    and me and my wife were moving back to New York. And he said   Why don't you see my colleagues in New York   And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called  What If   which some of you have probably heard of. And one thing led to another  and I ended up having a desk in  What If  in New York  when I started Independent Diplomat. And watching  What If  develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara. And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy    that diplomacy  like business  is a business of solving problems  and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy  it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things. And Independent Diplomat  today  tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at  What If . We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office. We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think. And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with  but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients. It's not easy  because our clients  by definition  are having a difficult time  diplomatically. There are  I don't know  some lessons from all of this  personal and political    and in a way  they're the same thing. The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing  and I recommend it. And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump. The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today. Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world  which is that the world is fragmenting. States mean less than they used to  and the power of the state is declining. That means the power of others things is rising. Those other things are called non state actors. They may be corporations  they may be mafiosi  they may be nice NGOs  they may anything  any number of things. We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world. If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world  then that means  who is left to deal with them  who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them  Us. If they can't do it  who's left to deal with it  We have no choice but to embrace that reality. What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations  or global affairs  or chaos in Somalia  or what's going on in Burma is none of your business  and that you can leave it to governments to get on with. I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al Shabaab militia in Somalia. Ask me how later  particularly if you eat fish  interestingly enough  but that connection is there. We are all intimately connected. And this isn't just Tom Friedman  it's actually provable in case after case after case. What that means is  instead of asking your politicians to do things  you have to look to yourself to do things. And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way. There aren't neat examples  but one example is this  the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work    the U.N. Security Council. The U.N. was established in     . Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states    interstate conflict. Today     percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states  involving non state parties    guerillas  separatists  terrorists  if you want to call them that  people who are not normal governments  who are not normal states. That is the state of the world today. When I realized this  and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars  and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there  weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council  I thought  this is wrong. Something's got to be done about this. So I started off in a traditional mode. Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council. We went around    U.N. member states    the Kazaks  the Ethiopians  the Israelis    you name them  we went to see them    the secretary general  all of them  and said   This is all wrong. This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected. You've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think. This will allow you to tell me    you can tell them what you think. It'll be great. You can have an exchange. You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions  which means your decisions will be more effective and durable.  Super logical  you would think. I mean  incredibly logical. So obvious  anybody could get it. And of course  everybody got it. Everybody went   Yes  of course  you're absolutely right. Come back to us in maybe six months.  And of course  nothing happened    nobody did anything. The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago  when I was there    years ago. So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought  what can we do about it. And I thought  I'm buggered if I'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done. So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves. So now  Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council. So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups  the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots  rebels from Aceh  and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world. And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council  and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want. So there's actually a conversation  which has never before happened. And of course  describing all this  any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult  and I entirely agree with you. The chances of failure are very high  but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen. And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today  and I think that outputs is what matters  not process  not technology  frankly  so much either. Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran  where Ahmadinejad remains in power. Technology has not delivered political change in Iran. You've got to look at the outputs  and you got to say to yourself   What can I do to produce that particular output   That is the politics of the   st century  and in a way  Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation  that change  that is happening to all of us. That's my story. Thanks. I am a cultural omnivore  one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod    an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart  pop diva Christina Aguilera  country singer Josh Turner  gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin  concerti  symphonies and more and more. I'm a voracious reader  a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer. I have read the  Twilight  tetralogy. And one who lives for my home theater  a home theater where I devour DVDs  video on demand and a lot of television. For me   Law and Order  SVU   Tine Fey and     Rock  and  Judge Judy      The people are real  the cases are real  the rulings are final.  Now  I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions  especially my passion for Judge Judy  and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us  but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life  a passion for the live professional performing arts  performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire  yes  but jazz as well  modern dance  opera  theater and more and more and more. You know  frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology. While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems  we now realize that the Internet is  if anything  too effective in that regard. Depending on who you read  an arts organization or an artist  who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer  now competes with between three and       different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day. We now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time. Five years ago  Gen X'ers spent   .  hours online and TV  the majority on TV. Gen Y'ers spent even more      .  hours  the majority online. And now  a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent        hours online and an additional        hours playing video games    a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined. Moreover  we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption. Thanks to the Internet  we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it  delivered to our own doorstep. We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night  ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types. Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts    which have set curtain times  set venues  attendant inconveniences of travel  parking and the like    simply cannot meet. And we're all acutely aware  what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony  opera or ballet ticket  when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet    hours a day for    cents a song or for free  These are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain. But as particular as they feel to us  we know we're not alone. All of us are engaged in a seismic  fundamental realignment of culture and communications  a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry  the magazine industry  the book and publishing industry and more. Saddled in the performing arts as we are  by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming  locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the   th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues  where we charge exorbitant prices. Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves   Are we next   Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich  who  in  Dreams of a Common Language   wrote   We are out in a country that has no language  no laws. Whatever we do together is pure invention. The maps they gave us are out of date by years.  And for those of you who love the arts  aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day  Now  rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation  I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation  a reformation like the religious Reformation of the   th century. The arts reformation  like the religious Reformation  is spurred in part by technology  with indeed  the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation. Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion  internal self doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models. And at heart  both reformations  I think were asking the questions  who's entitled to practice  How are they entitled to practice  And indeed  do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine  Chris Anderson  someone I trust you all know  editor in chief of Wired magazine and author of  The Long Tail   really was the first    for me    to nail a lot of this. He wrote a long time ago  you know  thanks to the invention of the Internet  web technology  mini cams and more  the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. In the     s  if any of you wanted to make a movie  you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more  And now who in this room doesn't know a    year old hard at work on her second  third  or fourth movie  Similarly  the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history. Again  in the '  s  Warner Brothers  RKO did that for you. Now  go to YouTube  Facebook  you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom. This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market  a time when anyone is a potential author. Frankly  what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time  when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting. But the number of arts participants  people who write poetry  who sing songs  who perform in church choirs  is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations. This group  others have called the  pro ams   amateur artists doing work at a professional level. You see them on YouTube  in dance competitions  film festivals and more. They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary  while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions. Ultimately  we now live in a world defined not by consumption  but by participation. But I want to be clear  just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood  I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance. They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity    not opulence    of dignity. And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home. But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is  by far  too short sighted. And indeed  while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional  the single most exciting development in the last five to    years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist  the professional artist who works  not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage  but most frequently around women's rights  or human rights  or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more    not out of economic necessity  but out of a deep  organic conviction that the work that she or he  is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment. Today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada  but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange    a multi generational  professional dance company  whose dancers range in age from    to     and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN. Today's professional theater community is defined  not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals  but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles    a collective of artists that after       brought together    different religious communities    the Bahia  the Catholic  the Muslim  the Jewish  even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith  helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play  where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing. Today's performers  like Rhodessa Jones  work in women's prisons  helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration  while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more. And indeed  I think  rather than being annihilated  the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been. You know  we've said for a long time  we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town. And absolutely    I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy  dollars spent in restaurants or on parking  at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes  the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more. But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward  especially in industries we can't even imagine yet  just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries  which few  if any of us come have foreseen    to    years ago. Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence  the ability to listen deeply  to have empathy  to articulate change  to motivate others    the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter. Especially now  as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation  uninformed by social conscience  we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters  and especially characters of the young people  who all too often  are subjected to bombardment of sensation  rather than digested experience. Ultimately  especially now in this world  where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws  in reality TV that thrives on humiliation  and in a context of analysis  where the thing we hear most repeatedly  day in  day out in the United States  in every train station  every bus station  every plane station is   Ladies and gentlemen  please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you   when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion. The arts  whatever they do  whenever they call us together  invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity. God knows  if we ever needed that capacity in human history  we need it now. You know  we're bound together  not  I think by technology  entertainment and design  but by common cause. We work to promote healthy vibrant societies  to ameliorate human suffering  to promote a more thoughtful  substantive  empathic world order. I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work  whatever your purpose may be. I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come. And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon. Thank you  and godspeed. If you really want to understand the problem that we're facing with the oceans  you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics. We can't solve the problems unless we start studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way. So I'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean. We'll look at sea level rise. We'll look at ocean warming. And then the last thing on the list there  ocean acidification    if you were to ask me  you know   What do you worry about the most  What frightens you   for me  it's ocean acidification. And this has come onto the stage pretty recently. So I will spend a little time at the end. I was in Copenhagen in December like a number of you in this room. And I think we all found it  simultaneously  an eye opening and a very frustrating experience. I sat in this large negotiation hall  at one point  for three or four hours  without hearing the word  oceans  one time. It really wasn't on the radar screen. The nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders    it tended to be the leaders of the small island states  the low lying island states. And by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations  a lot of the low lying states  like Kiribati and Nauru  they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows. You know  they were marginalized in the negotiation room. One of the problems is coming up with the right target. It's not clear what the target should be. And how can you figure out how to fix something if you don't have a clear target  Now  you've heard about  two degrees   that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees. But there's not a lot of science behind that number. We've also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Should it be      Should it be      There's not a lot of science behind that one either. Most of the science that is behind these numbers  these potential targets  is based on studies on land. And I would say  for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be  we would argue that they must be much lower. You know  from an oceanic perspective      is way too high. Now there's compelling evidence that it really needs to be    . We are  right now  at     parts per million of CO  in the atmosphere. We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at      so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot  and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on how far the overshoot goes and what's the pathway back to    . Now  why is this so complicated  Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better  Well  the problem is that we've got very complicated forces in the climate system. There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change. There's air sea interactions. Here in Galapagos  we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina. But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino. Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere. That changes our climate. The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet. So anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet. And we know the solar output's not constant through time. So those are all natural causes of climate change. And then we have the human induced causes of climate change as well. We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land  the reflectivity. We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere  and we have trace gases  and not just carbon dioxide    it's methane  ozone  oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question. Is CO  produced by man's activities causing the planet to warm up  But to answer that question  to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide  you have to know something about all of these other agents of change. But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things. You know  thousands of scientists have been working on understanding all of these man made causes and the natural causes. And we've got it worked out  and we can say   Yes  CO  is causing the planet to warm up now.  Now  we have many ways to study natural variability. I'll show you a few examples of this now. This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic. It's a scientific drilling vessel. We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change  right. Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had CO  double what it is today. And so that's what we've done with this ship. This was    this is south of the Antarctic Circle. It looks downright tropical there. One day where we had calm seas and sun  which was the reason I could get off the ship. Most of the time it looked like this. We had a waves up to    ft. and winds averaging about    knots for most of the voyage and up to    or    knots. So that trip just ended  and I can't show you too many results from that right now  but we'll go back one more year  to another drilling expedition I've been involved in. This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish. It's the ANDRILL project. And we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet. This is a crazy thing  this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm  drilling at temperatures of minus   . And we drilled in the Ross Sea. That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there. So  this huge floating ice shelf the size of Alaska comes from West Antarctica. Now  West Antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as       meters deep. So that ice sheet is partly floating  and it's exposed to the ocean  to the ocean heat. This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about. Because it's partly floating  you can imagine  is sea level rises a little bit  the ice lifts off the bed  and then it can break off and float north. When that ice melts  sea level rises by six meters. So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened  and exactly how fast that ice can melt. Here's the cartoon on the left there. We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through     meters of water and then       meters into the sea floor. So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled. It took about    years to put this project together. And here's what we found. Now  there's    scientists working on this project  and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses. But it turns out  you know  the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description. You know  we saw this in the core samples as they came up. We saw these alternations between sediments that look like this    there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand. That's the kind of material in the deep sea. It can only get there if it's carried out by ice. So we know there's an ice shelf overhead. And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this. This is absolutely beautiful stuff. This sediment is     percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants. And these plants need sunlight  so we know when we find that sediment there's no ice overhead. And we saw about    alternations between open water and ice covered water  between gravels and these plant sediments. So what that means is  what it tells us is that the Ross Sea region  this ice shelf  melted back and formed anew about    times. And this is in the past four million years. This was completely unexpected. Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic. In fact  the lore for many years has been   The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago  and it's been there ever since.  And now we know that in our recent past it melted back and formed again  and sea level went up and down  six meters at a time. What caused it  Well  we're pretty sure that it's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica  just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth. But here's the key thing  you know  the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold  that the planet warmed up enough    and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade    the planet warmed up enough that it became ... that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted. And you know what  We've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount. So many of us are convinced now that West Antarctica  the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  is starting to melt. We do expect to see a sea level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century. And it could be larger than that. This is a serious consequence for nations like Kiribati  you know  where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level. Okay  the second story takes place here in Galapagos. This is a bleached coral  coral that died during the      '   El Nino. This is from Champion Island. It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony. And it's covered with algae. That's what happens. When these things die  immediately  organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface. And so  when a coral colony is killed by an El Nino event  it leaves this indelible record. You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this. So one of the things thought of in the '  s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the Galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event. And just so you know       '    that El Nino killed    percent of all the corals here in Galapagos. Then there was similar mortality in '   '  . And what we found after drilling back in time two to     years was that these were unique events. We saw no other mass mortality events. So these events in our recent past really are unique. So they're either just truly monster El Ninos  or they're just very strong El Ninos that occurred against a backdrop of global warming. Either case  it's bad news for the corals of the Galapagos Islands. Here's how we sample the corals. This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster. This coral is eight meters tall  right. And it been growing for about     years. Now  Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral. And she was diving here with John Lauret    I think it was         and collected a little nugget and sent it to me. And we started working on it  and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this. So we have a diamond drill. We're not killing the colony  we're taking a small core sample out of the top. The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone. And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it. You can see some of the coral cores there on the right. So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific. We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well. I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands. And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay. That the place where  during an earthquake in       this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly  and it was lifted up about six to seven meters. And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet. If you go on the ground there  it looks like this  and this is the grandaddy coral. It's    meters in diameter  and we know that it started growing in the year     . Imagine that. And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters  until       when the earthquake happened. Now the reason we know it's      is that these corals have growth bands. When you cut them  slice those cores in half and x ray them  you see these light and dark bands. Each one of those is a year. We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year. And we just count on down to the bottom. Then their other attribute is that they have this great chemistry. We can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral  and there's a whole bunch of things we can do. But in this case  we measured the different isotopes of oxygen. Their ratio tells us the water temperature. In this example here  we had monitored this reef in Galapagos with temperature recorders  so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in. Then after we harvest a coral  we measure this ratio  and now you can see  those curves match perfectly. In this case  at these islands  you know  corals are instrumental quality recorders of change in the water. And of course  our thermometers only take us back    years or so here. The coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years. So  what we do  we've merged a lot of different data sets. It's not just my group  there's maybe    groups worldwide doing this. But we get these instrumental  and near instrumental quality records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years  and we put them together. Here's a synthetic diagram. There's a whole family of curves here. But what's happening  we're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet. And there's five or six different compilations there  But each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals. We do similar things with ice cores. We work with tree rings. And that's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century  right  And I chose this one because it's complicated and messy looking  right. This is as messy as it gets. You can see there's some signals there. Some of the records show lower temperatures than others. Some of them show greater variability. But they all tell us what the natural variability is. Some of them are from the northern hemisphere  some are from the entire globe. But here's what we can say  what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down. It was cooling down until about      or so. And there is natural variability caused by the Sun  caused by El Ninos. A century scale  decadal scale variability  and we know the magnitude  it's about two tenths to four tenths of a degree Centigrade. But then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black. And there's the temperature up there in     . You know  we've warmed the globe about a degree Centigrade in the last century  and there's nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we've seen in the last century. You know  that's the strength of our argument  that we are doing something that's truly different. So I'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification. I like it as a component of global change to talk about  because  even if you are a hard bitten global warming skeptic  and I talk to that community fairly often  you cannot deny the simple physics of CO  dissolving in the ocean. You know  we're pumping out lots of CO  into the atmosphere  from fossil fuels  from cement production. Right now  about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea  right  And as it does so  it makes the ocean more acidic. So  you cannot argue with that. That is what's happening right now  and it's a very different issue than the global warming issue. It has many consequences. There's consequences for carbonate organisms. There are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate    plants and animals both. The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate. That material is more soluble in acidic fluid. So one of the things we're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain their shells. At some point  as this transience  as this CO  uptake in the ocean continues  that material's actually going to start to dissolve. And on coral reefs  where some of the main framework organisms disappear  we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity. But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected. There's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean. So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean. So  all of these things    greater metabolic demands  reduced reproductive success  changes in respiration and metabolism. You know  these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience. So we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track CO  levels in the atmosphere  going back millions of years. We used to do it just with ice cores  but in this case  we're going back    million years. And we take samples of the sediment  and it tells us the CO  level of the ocean  and therefore the CO  level of the atmosphere. And here's the thing  you have to go back about    million years to find a time when CO  levels were about what they are today. You have to go back about    million years to find a time when CO  levels were double what they are today. Now  what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean  with CO  levels lower than they are today. That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now. So  Charlie Veron came up with this statement last year   The prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic CO  release.  And I think that may very well be true  so I'll close with this. You know  we do need the protected areas  absolutely  but for the sake of the oceans  we have to cap or limit CO  emissions as soon as possible. Thank you very much. If nothing else  at least I've discovered what it is we put our speakers through  sweaty palms  sleepless nights  a wholly unnatural fear of clocks. I mean  it's quite brutal. And I'm also a little nervous about this. There are nine billion humans coming our way. Now  the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet. But recently  I've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds  because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool. It's a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into. It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future  and perhaps the world's future overall. So  let's explore. The story starts with just a single person  a child  behaving a little strangely. This kid is known online as Lil Demon. He's doing tricks here  dance tricks  that probably no six year old in history ever managed before. How did he learn them  And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must have taken  Here's a clue.   Step your game up. Oh. Oh.   Chris Anderson  So  that was sent to me by this man  a filmmaker  Jonathan Chu  who told me that was the moment he realized the Internet was causing dance to evolve. This is what he said at TED in February. In essence  dancers were challenging each other online to get better  incredible new dance skills were being invented  even the six year olds were joining in. It felt like a revolution. And so Jon had a brilliant idea  He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of YouTube to create this dance troupe    The League of Extraordinary Dancers  the LXD. I mean  these kids were web taught  but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year. And at TED here in February  their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. So  this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar. You know  a while after TEDTalks started taking off  we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation. It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two. ... Months of preparation crammed into    minutes  raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers  with the effects that we've seen this week. It's not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying   Step your game up   but they might as well have. So  in both of these cases  you've got these cycles of improvement  apparently driven by people watching web video. What is going on here  Well  I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call  crowd accelerated innovation.  And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear. You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel. You turn up the dials  the wheel starts to turn. And the first thing you need is ... a crowd  a group of people who share a common interest. The bigger the crowd  the more potential innovators there are. That's important  but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles. They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges. The second thing you need is light. You need clear  open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of  because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate. And third  you need desire. You know  innovation's hard work. It's based on hundreds of hours of research  of practice. Absent desire  not going to happen. Now  here's an example    pre Internet    of this machine in action. Dancers at a street corner    it's a crowd  a small one  but they can all obviously see what each other can do. And the desire part comes  I guess  from social status  right  Best dancer walks tall  gets the best date. There's probably going to be some innovation happening here. But on the web  all three dials are ratcheted right up. The dance community is now global. There's millions connected. And amazingly  you can still see what the best can do  because the crowd itself shines a light on them  either directly  through comments  ratings  email  Facebook  Twitter  or indirectly  through numbers of views  through links that point Google there. So  it's easy to find the good stuff  and when you've found it  you can watch it in close up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it. That's a lot of light. But the desire element is really dialed way up. I mean  you might just be a kid with a webcam  but if you can do something that goes viral  you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people. You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you. And even if it's not that eloquent    and it's not    it can still really make your day. So  this possibility of a new type of global recognition  I think  is driving huge amounts of effort. And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting  because you can see the best  everyone can learn. Also  the system is self fueling. It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire  but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd. So  this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. Invite the crowd  let in the light  dial up the desire. And the hardest part about that is probably the light  because it means you have to open up  you have to show your stuff to the world. It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it. And  very happily  there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool. The dark side of the web is allergic to the light. I don't think we're going to see terrorists  for example  publishing their plans online and saying to the world   Please  could you help us to actually make them work this time   But you can publish your stuff online. And if you can get that wheel to turn  look out. So  at TED  we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness. In fact  my colleague  June Cohen  has taken to calling it  radical openness   because it works for us each time. We opened up our talks to the world  and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers' ideas  and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers. By opening up our translation program  thousands of heroic volunteers    some of them watching online right now  and thank you     have translated our talks into more than    languages  thereby tripling our viewership in non English speaking countries. By giving away our TEDx brand  we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas. And these organizers  they're seeing each other  they're learning from each other. We are learning from them. We're getting great talks back from them. The wheel is turning. Okay  step back a minute. I mean  it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups. You know  we've heard that this week    this romantic notion of the lone genius with the  eureka   moment that changes the world is misleading. Even he said that  and he would know. We're a social species. We spark off each other. It's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation. For the past    years  powerful communities have been connecting online  sparking off each other. If you take programmers  you know  the whole open source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation. But what's key here is  the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally    a picture  a music file  software. And that's why what I'm excited about  and what I think is under reported  is the significance of the rise of online video. This is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally  thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation. The first few years of the web were pretty much video free  for this reason  video files are huge  the web couldn't handle them. But in the last    years  bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold. Suddenly  here we are. Humanity watches    million hours of YouTube every day. Cisco actually estimates that  within four years  more than    percent of the web's data will be video. If it's all puppies  porn and piracy  we're doomed. I don't think it will be. Video is high bandwidth for a reason. It packs a huge amount of data  and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it. Here  let me introduce you to Sam Haber. He's a unicyclist. Before YouTube  there was no way for him to discover his sport's true potential  because you can't communicate this stuff in words  right  But looking at video clips posted by strangers  a world of possibility opens up for him. Suddenly  he starts to emulate and then to innovate. And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online  inspire each other to greatness. And there are thousands of other examples of this happening    of video driven evolution of skills  ranging from the physical to the artful. And I have to tell you  as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines  I find this strangely beautiful. I mean  there's a lot of passion right here on this screen. But if Rube Goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea  how about this. Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research on video. There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper. It can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print. Here's one such frustrated scientist  Moshe Pritsker  the founder of Jove. He told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this. But look at this video. I mean  look  if you can show instead of just describing  that problem goes away. So it's not far fetched to say that  at some point  online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance. Here's another example that's close to our hearts at TED  where video is sometimes more powerful than print    the sharing of an idea. Why do people like watching TEDTalks  All those ideas are already out there in print. It's actually faster to read than to view. Why would someone bother  Well  so  there's some showing as well as telling. But even leaving the screen out of it  there's still a lot more being transferred than just words. And in that non verbal portion  there's some serious magic. Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures  the vocal cadence  the facial expressions  the eye contact  the passion  the kind of awkward  British body language  the sense of how the audience are reacting  there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand  and whether you're inspired    light  if you like  and desire. Incredibly  all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen. Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions. Face to face communication has been fine tuned by millions of years of evolution. That's what's made it into this mysterious  powerful thing it is. Someone speaks  there's resonance in all these receiving brains  the whole group acts together. I mean  this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action. It's probably driven our culture for millennia.     years ago  it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage. It's right here. Print scaled. The world's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide  and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine. But now  in the blink of an eye  the game has changed again. It's not too much to say that what Gutenberg did for writing  online video can now do for face to face communication. So  that primal medium  which your brain is exquisitely wired for ... that just went global. Now  this is big. We may have to reinvent an ancient art form. I mean  today  one person speaking can be seen by millions  shedding bright light on potent ideas  creating intense desire for learning and to respond    and in his case  intense desire to laugh. For the first time in human history  talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers. They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest. Now  TED is just a small part of this. I mean  the world's universities are opening up their curricula. Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online. Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and  crucially  to respond  completing the cycle. And so  as we've thought about this  you know  it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be. TEDTalks can't be a one way process  one to many. Our future is many to many. So  we're dreaming of ways to make it easier for you  the global TED community  to respond to speakers  to contribute your own ideas  maybe even your own TEDTalks  and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there. Because  if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool  this wheel turns. Now  is it possible to imagine a similar process to this  happening to global education overall  I mean  does it have to be this painful  top down process  Why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate  It's the participation age  right  Schools can't be silos. We can't stop learning at age   . What if  in the coming crowd of nine billion ... what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors  instead of net plunderers  That changes everything  right  I mean  that would take more teachers than we've ever had. But the good news is they are out there. They're in the crowd  and the crowd is switching on lights  and we can see them for the first time  not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers  but as individuals we can learn from. Who's the teacher  You're the teacher. You're part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history  a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter  wiser  more beautiful place. Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up. Within five years  each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video and capable of uploading video to the web. I mean  is it crazy to think that this girl  in the back  at the right  in    years  might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren  It's not crazy  it's actually happening right now. I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown. I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera. There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera. There's a self help group. They turned a trash place into a garden. The same spot  it was a crime spot where people were being robbed. They used the same trash to form green manure. The same trash site is feeding more than    families. We have our own film school. They are using Flip cameras to record  edit  and reporting to their own channel  Kibera TV. Because of a scarcity of land  we are using the sacks to grow vegetables  and also  we're  able to save on the cost of living. Change happens when we see things in a different way. Today  I see Kibera in a different way. My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is  Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas. CA  You know what  I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy. What's new    and it's huge    is that  for the first time  we get to see him  and he can see us. Right now  Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us  in Nairobi  right now. Guys  we've learned from you today. Thank you. And thank you. Let's start with day and night. Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness  light and then darkness. And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light. These are chemical clocks  and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell. I'll give you an example    if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach  and you fly it all the way across the continent  and you drop it into a sloped cage  it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores  and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away. It'll do this for weeks  until it kind of gradually loses the plot. And it's incredible to watch  but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on  it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond  usually  with what's going on around it. So  we have this ability as well. And in humans  we call it the  body clock.  You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker  deep underground  for a couple of months.  Laughter  People actually volunteer for this  and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole. So  no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be  they all show the same thing. They get up just a little bit later every day    say    minutes or so    and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks. And so  in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks  rather than somehow sensing the day outside. So fine  we have a body clock  and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives. It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior. We evolved as a species near the equator  and so we're very well equipped to deal with    hours of daylight and    hours of darkness. But of course  we've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada  where I live  we have perpetual daylight in summer and    hours of darkness in winter. So the culture  the northern aboriginal culture  traditionally has been highly seasonal. In winter  there's a lot of sleeping going on  you enjoy your family life inside. And in summer  it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours  very active. So  what would our natural rhythm look like  What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense  Well  it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all  they sleep twice every night. They go to bed around      p.m. until midnight and then again  they sleep from about      a.m. until sunrise. And in between  they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed. And during this time  there's a surge of prolactin  the likes of which a modern day never sees. The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime  that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives. So  cut to the modern day. We're living in a culture of jet lag  global travel     hour business  shift work. And you know  our modern ways of doing things have their advantages  but I believe we should understand the costs. Thank you. For the last    years  I've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks. And the kind of social network I'm talking about is not the recent online variety  but rather  the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years  ever since we emerged from the African savannah. So  I form friendships and co worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people. And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance. And you get a network that looks like this. Every dot is a person. Every line between them is a relationship between two people    different kinds of relationships. And you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity  in which we're all embedded. And my colleague  James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical  social  biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate  how they affect our lives. But recently  we've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight  to actually find ways to improve the world  to do something better  to actually fix things  not just understand things. So one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics. And the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic    if you're the CDC or some other national body    is to sit in the middle where you are and collect data from physicians and laboratories in the field that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions. So  so and so patients have been diagnosed with something  or other patients have been diagnosed  and all these data are fed into a central repository  with some delay. And if everything goes smoothly  one to two weeks from now you'll know where the epidemic was today. And actually  about a year or so ago  there was this promulgation of the idea of Google Flu Trends  with respect to the flu  where by looking at people's searching behavior today  we could know where the flu    what the status of the epidemic was today  what's the prevalence of the epidemic today. But what I'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic  but also actually early detection of an epidemic. And  in fact  this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs  but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds. For example  anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way  from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism  or altruism  or religion to practices like dieting behavior  or book purchasing  or drinking  or bicycle helmet  and  other safety practices  or products that people might buy  purchases of electronic goods  anything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread. A kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism I'm going to show you now. So  as all of you probably know  the classic way of thinking about this is the diffusion of innovation  or the adoption curve. So here on the Y axis  we have the percent of the people affected  and on the X axis  we have time. And at the very beginning  not too many people are affected  and you get this classic sigmoidal  or S shaped  curve. And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning  let's say one or two people are infected  or affected by the thing and then they affect  or infect  two people  who in turn affect four  eight     and so forth  and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve. And eventually  you saturate the population. There are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect  and then you get the plateau of the curve  and you get this classic sigmoidal curve. And this holds for germs  ideas  product adoption  behaviors  and the like. But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random. They actually diffuse through networks. Because  as I said  we live our lives in networks  and these networks have a particular kind of a structure. Now if you look at a network like this    this is     people. And the lines represent    the dots are the people  and the lines represent friendship relationships. You might see that people occupy different locations within the network. And there are different kinds of relationships between the people. You could have friendship relationships  sibling relationships  spousal relationships  co worker relationships  neighbor relationships and the like. And different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties. For instance  sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties. Or  for instance  people's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends. Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers  or by their neighbors. But not all positions in the network are the same. So if you look at this  you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections. Some people have one connection  some have two  some have six  some have    connections. And this is called the  degree  of a node  or the number of connections that a node has. But in addition  there's something else. So  if you look at nodes A and B  they both have six connections. But if you can see this image  of the network  from a bird's eye view  you can appreciate that there's something very different about nodes A and B. So  let me ask you this    I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question    who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network  A or B  B is located on the edge of the network. Now  who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network  A. And you have an immediate appreciation that A is going to be more likely to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location within the network. A  in fact  is more central  and this can be formalized mathematically. So  if we want to track something that was spreading through a network  what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network  including node A  monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network  and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network. So if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information  you would know that  soon enough  everybody was about to contract this germ or this piece of information. And this would be much better than monitoring six randomly chosen people  without reference to the structure of the population. And in fact  if you could do that  what you would see is something like this. On the left hand panel  again  we have the S shaped curve of adoption. In the dotted red line  we show what the adoption would be in the random people  and in the left hand line  shifted to the left  we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network. On the Y axis is the cumulative instances of contagion  and on the X axis is the time. And on the right hand side  we show the same data  but here with daily incidence. And what we show here is    like  here    very few people are affected  more and more and more and up to here  and here's the peak of the epidemic. But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals. And this difference in time between the two is the early detection  the early warning we can get  about an impending epidemic in the human population. The problem  however  is that mapping human social networks is not always possible. It can be expensive  not feasible  unethical  or  frankly  just not possible to do such a thing. So  how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network  What we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact  or a known fact  about social networks  which goes like this  Do you know that your friends have more friends than you do  Your friends have more friends than you do  and this is known as the friendship paradox. Imagine a very popular person in the social network    like a party host who has hundreds of friends    and a misanthrope who has just one friend  and you pick someone at random from the population  they were much more likely to know the party host. And if they nominate the party host as their friend  that party host has a hundred friends  therefore  has more friends than they do. And this  in essence  is what's known as the friendship paradox. The friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree  and are more central than the random people themselves. And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network. If you pick this person  the only friend they have to nominate is this person  who  by construction  must have at least two and typically more friends. And that happens at every peripheral node. And in fact  it happens throughout the network as you move in  everyone you pick  when they nominate a random    when a random person nominates a friend of theirs  you move closer to the center of the network. So  we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks. Because now  with this idea we can take a random sample of people  have them nominate their friends  those friends would be more central  and we could do this without having to map the network. And we tested this idea with an outbreak of H N  flu at Harvard College in the fall and winter of       just a few months ago. We took       randomly selected undergraduates  we had them nominate their friends  and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic. And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services. And also  we had them  actively  email us a couple of times a week. Exactly what we predicted happened. So the random group is in the red line. The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left  over here. And the difference in the two is    days. By monitoring the friends group  we could get    days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population. Now  in addition to that  if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product  for example  what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population  also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends. Among the friends  the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation  for example  would be evidence of an impending epidemic. Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged  as shown on the left. When did the randoms    when did the friends take off and leave the randoms  and  when did  their curve start shifting  And that  as indicated by the white line  occurred    days before the peak of the epidemic. So this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month and a half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population. I should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors. It could depend on the nature of the pathogen    different pathogens  using this technique  you'd get different warning    or other phenomena that are spreading  or frankly  on the structure of the human network. Now in our case  although it wasn't necessary  we could also actually map the network of the students. So  this is a map of     students and their friendship ties. And in a minute now  I'm going to put this map into motion. We're going to take daily cuts through the network for     days. The red dots are going to be cases of the flu  and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu. And the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu. So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu. And if you look at this image    here we are now in September the   th    you're going to see a few cases light up. You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle. Here we are on October the   th. The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now  in November. Bang  bang  bang  bang  bang    you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle  and then you're going to see a sort of leveling off  fewer and fewer cases towards the end of December. And this type of a visualization can show that epidemics like this take root and affect central individuals first  before they affect others. Now  as I've been suggesting  this method is not restricted to germs  but actually to anything that spreads in populations. Information spreads in populations  norms can spread in populations  behaviors can spread in populations. And by behaviors  I can mean things like criminal behavior  or voting behavior  or health care behavior  like smoking  or vaccination  or product adoption  or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence. If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me  this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population. The key thing is that for it to work  there has to be interpersonal influence. It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly. Now the same insights can also be exploited    with respect to networks    can also be exploited in other ways  for example  in the use of targeting specific people for interventions. So  for example  most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity. So  if we have a population of a thousand people  and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen  we don't have to immunize every single person. If we immunize     of them  it's as if we had immunized a hundred  percent  of them. Because even if one or two of the non immune people gets infected  there's no one for them to infect. They are surrounded by immunized people. So    percent is as good as     percent. Well  some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a    percent random sample of these      people      people and immunized them. Would you get any population level immunity  And the answer is no. But if you took this    percent  these     people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated the friends of the        the     friends    you can get the same level of herd immunity as if you had vaccinated    percent of the population at a much greater efficiency  with a strict budget constraint. And similar ideas can be used  for instance  to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world. If we could understand the structure of networks in villages  we could target to whom to give the interventions to foster these kinds of spreads. Or  frankly  for advertising with all kinds of products. If we could understand how to target  it could affect the efficiency of what we're trying to achieve. And in fact  we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays  to do this . This is a map of eight million phone users in a European country. Every dot is a person  and every line represents a volume of calls between the people. And we can use such data  that's being passively obtained  to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network. Without actually having to query them at all  we can get this kind of a structural insight. And other sources of information  as you're no doubt aware are available about such features  from email interactions  online interactions  online social networks and so forth. And in fact  we are in the era of what I would call  massive passive  data collection efforts. They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population  understand what's happening in the population  and intervene in the population for the better. Because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom  but where everyone is  and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet  and what they're buying based on their purchases. And all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before. So  for example  we could use truckers' purchases of fuel. So the truckers are just going about their business  and they're buying fuel. And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel  and we know that a recession is about to end. Or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway  and the phone company can see  as the velocity is slowing down  that there's a traffic jam. And they can feed that information back to their subscribers  but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam  Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors  passively  and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within  networks of  doctors. Or again  we can monitor purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations. And there are three ways  I think  that these massive passive data can be used. One is fully passive  like I just described    as in  for instance  the trucker example  where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way. One is quasi active  like the flu example I gave  where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends    do they have the flu  or not     and then get warning. Or another example would be  if you're a phone company  you figure out who's central in the network and you ask those people   Look  will you just text us your fever every day  Just text us your temperature.  And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature  but from centrally located individuals. And be able  on a large scale  to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people. Or  finally  it can be more fully active    as I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today    where people might globally participate in wikis  or photographing  or monitoring elections  and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena. In fact  the availability of these data  I think  heralds a kind of new era of what I and others would like to call  computational social science.  It's sort of like when Galileo invented    or  didn't invent    came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way  or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope    or actually invented    and could see biology in a new way. But now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible. And with this science  we can understand how exactly the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts. And actually  we can use these insights to improve society and improve human well being. Thank you. Now  since this is TEDGlobal  who can tell me what this is called in French  I see you're all up on the history of hurdy gurdy     vielle   roue.  And in Spanish   zanfona.  And in Italian   ghironda   okay  Hurdy gurdy  or wheel fiddle. So  these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy gurdy. The hurdy gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings  like the bow of a violin  to produce music. It has three different kinds of strings. The first string is the drone string  which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe. The second string is a melody string  which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. And the third string is pretty innovative. It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique. It activates what's called the buzzing bridge  or the dog. When I turn the crank and I apply pressure  it makes a sound like a barking dog. So all of this is pretty innovative  if you consider that the hurdy gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it  one to turn the crank  and another person    yes    to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs. Luckily  all of this changed a couple of centuries later. So  one person could actually play and almost    this is pretty heavy    carry the hurdy gurdy. The hurdy gurdy has been used  historically  through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here. And today  the hurdy gurdy is used in all sorts of music    traditional folk music  dance  contemporary and world music    in the U.K.  in France  in Spain and in Italy. And this kind of hurdy gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years  to order and receive it . It's made by specialized luthiers  also in Europe. And it's very difficult to tune. So without further ado  would you like to hear it  Caroline Phillips  I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it   Audience  Yes   CP  Okay. There I go. I'd like to sing in Basque  which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live  in the region in France and Spain.  Basque  Thank you. This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms. And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. I would like to start my talk with actually two questions  and the first one is  How many people here actually eat pig meat  Please raise your hand    oh  that's a lot. And how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat  In the last year  In the Netherlands    where I come from    you actually never see a pig  which is really strange  because  on a population of    million people  we have    million pigs. And well  of course  the Dutch can't eat all these pigs. They eat about one third  and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world. A lot goes to the U.K.  Germany. And what I was curious about    because historically  the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted    and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case. And I spent about three years researching. And I followed this one pig with number          all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of. And in these years  I met all kinds people like  for instance  farmers and butchers  which seems logical. But I also met aluminum mold makers  ammunition producers and all kinds of people. And what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs  but the consumers    as in us    had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products. So what I did is  I took all this research and I made it into a    well  basically it's a product catalog of this one pig  and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back. And it consists of seven chapters    the chapters are skin  bones  meat  internal organs  blood  fat and miscellaneous. In total  they weigh    .  kilograms. And to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day  I want to show you some images of the book. You probably start the day with a shower. So  in soap  fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent  but also for giving it a pearl like effect. Then if you look around you in the bathroom  you see lots more products like shampoo  conditioner  anti wrinkle cream  body lotion  but also toothpaste. Then  so  before breakfast  you've already met the pig so many times. Then  at breakfast  the pig that I followed  the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough. Well  that's what the producer says  it's  improving the dough  of course.  In low fat butter  or actually in many low fat products  when you take the fat out  you actually take the taste and the texture out. So what they do is they put gelatin back in  in order to retain the texture. Well  when you're off to work  under the road or under the buildings that you see  there might very well be cellular concrete  which is a very light kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable. In the train brakes    at least in the German train brakes    there's this part of the brake that's made of bone ash. And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts  like chocolate mousse  tiramisu  vanilla pudding  everything that's cooled in the supermarket  there's gelatin to make it look good. Fine bone china    this is a real classic. Of course  the bone in fine bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength  in order to make these really fine shapes  like this deer. In interior decorating  the pig's actually quite there. It's used in paint for the texture  but also for the glossiness. In sandpaper  bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper. And then in paintbrushes  hairs are used because  apparently  they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature. I was not planning on showing you any meat because  of course  half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are. But I didn't want you to miss out on this one  because this  well  it's called  portion controlled meat cuts.  And this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket. And what it is    it's actually steak. So  this is sold as cow  but what happens when you slaughter a cow    at least in industrial factory farming    they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak  so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage  then freeze the sausage  cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again. And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops. So  with the steak  you might drink a beer. In the brewing process  there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer  so to get rid of these cloudy elements  what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness. This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice. There's actually a company in Greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter. And according to them  this creates an artificial lung in the filter. So  this is actually a healthier cigarette. Injectable collagen    or  since the '  s  collagen from pigs    has been used for injecting into wrinkles. And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings  so the collagen is as well. Well  this must be the strangest thing I found. This is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the United States. And while I was making the book  I contacted all the producers of products because I wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens. So I sent this company an email saying   Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research. And can you send me a bullet   And well  I didn't expect them to even answer my email. But they answered and they said   Why  thank you for your email. What an interesting story. Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government   I thought that was really weird  as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone. So  the most beautiful thing I found    at least what I think is the most beautiful    in the book  is this heart valve. It's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time. The low tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve mounted in the high tech bit  which is a memory metal casing. And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery. And once it's in the right spot  they remove the outer shell  and the heart valve  well  it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating  instantly. It's really a sort of magical moment. So this is actually a Dutch company  so I called them up  and I asked   Can I borrow a heart valve from you   And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic. So they were like   Okay  we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin  and you can borrow it.  Great    and then I didn't hear from them for weeks  so I called  and I asked   What's going on with the heart valve   And they said   Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve  because want his product to be associated with pigs.  Well  the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy    actually  to show that my first question  if pigs are still used up until the last bit  was still true. Well it is  because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source. In total  I found     products. And what they showed me is that  well  firstly  it's at least to say odd that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens. And the second  is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of. And you might think I'm very fond of pigs  but actually    well  I am a little bit    but I'm more fond of raw materials in general. And I think that  in order to take better care of what's behind our products    so  the livestock  the crops  the plants  the non renewable materials  but also the people that produce these products    the first step would actually be to know that they are there. Thank you very much. Just a few minutes ago  I took this picture about    blocks from here. This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford. I took this picture because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in England in     . That's its great claim to fame  and I wanted to show it to you  not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour of historic England  but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last     years  what we now call the Enlightenment. And the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the Enlightenment  in part  because of what people were drinking there. Because  before the spread of coffee and tea through British culture  what people drank    both elite and mass folks drank    day in and day out  from dawn until dusk was alcohol. Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice. You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch  a little gin    particularly around         and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day. That was the healthy choice    right    because the water wasn't safe to drink. And so  effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse  you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day. And you can imagine what that would be like  right  in your own life    and I know this is true of some of you    if you were drinking all day  and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life  you would have better ideas. You would be sharper and more alert. And so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee. But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space. It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds  different fields of expertise  and share. It was a space  as Matt Ridley talked about  where ideas could have sex. This was their conjugal bed  in a sense    ideas would get together there. And an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story. I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses for the last five years  because I've been kind of on this quest to investigate this question of where good ideas come from. What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation  unusual levels of creativity  What's the kind of environmental    what is the space of creativity  And what I've done is I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse  I've looked at media environments  like the world wide web  that have been extraordinarily innovative  I've gone back to the history of the first cities  I've even gone to biological environments  like coral reefs and rainforests  that involve unusual levels of biological innovation  and what I've been looking for is shared patterns  kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments. Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from  that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives  or our own organizations  or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative  And I think I've found a few. But what you have to do to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain concepts of idea creation. We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration. We have the kind of the flash of insight  the stroke of insight  we have epiphanies  we have  eureka   moments  we have the lightbulb moments  right  All of these concepts  as kind of rhetorically florid as they are  share this basic assumption  which is that an idea is a single thing  it's something that happens often in a wonderful illuminating moment. But in fact  what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level. I mean  this is what is happening inside your brain. An idea    a new idea    is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain. It's a new configuration that has never formed before. And the question is  how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form  And it turns out that  in fact  the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the human brain. So the metaphor I'd like the use I can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent    a lot more recent than the     s. A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero  who has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters. They decided to tackle this really pressing problem of  you know  the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world. One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know  by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context  if we can keep premature babies warm  basically    it's very simple    we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments. So  the technology is there. These are standard in all the industrialized worlds. The problem is  if you buy a         incubator  and you send it off to a mid sized village in Africa  it will work great for a year or two years  and then something will go wrong and it will break  and it will remain broken forever  because you don't have a whole system of spare parts  and you don't have the on the ground expertise to fix this         piece of equipment. And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries  and then it ends up being useless. So what Prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see  what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts  And what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs  they don't have a lot of microwaves  but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road. There's a Toyota Forerunner on the street in all these places. They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working. So they started to think   Could we build a neonatal incubator that's built entirely out of automobile parts   And this is what they ended up coming with. It's called a  neonurture device.  From the outside  it looks like a normal little thing you'd find in a modern  Western hospital. In the inside  it's all car parts. It's got a fan  it's got headlights for warmth  it's got door chimes for alarm    it runs off a car battery. And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota and the ability to fix a headlight  and you can repair this thing. Now  that's a great idea  but what I'd like to say is that  in fact  this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen. We like to think our breakthrough ideas  you know  are like that          brand new incubator  state of the art technology  but more often than not  they're cobbled together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby. We take ideas from other people  from people we've learned from  from people we run into in the coffee shop  and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new. That's really where innovation happens. And that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like  right. I mean  this is one vision of it. Another is Newton and the apple  when Newton was at Cambridge. This is a statue from Oxford. You know  you're sitting there thinking a deep thought  and the apple falls from the tree  and you have the theory of gravity. In fact  the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this  right. This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern  but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then. This is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together  where people were likely to have new  interesting  unpredictable collisions    people from different backgrounds. So  if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative  we have to build spaces that    strangely enough    look a little bit more like this. This is what your office should look like  is part of my message here. And one of the problems with this is that people are actually    when you research this field    people are notoriously unreliable  when they actually kind of self report on where they have their own good ideas  or their history of their best ideas. And a few years ago  a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar decided to go around and basically do the Big Brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from. He went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job. So when they were sitting in front of the microscope  when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler  and all these things. And he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas  where they happened. And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab  we have this image    you know  they're pouring over the microscope  and they see something in the tissue sample. And  oh  eureka   they've got the idea. What happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that  in fact  almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab  in front of the microscope. They happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting  when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings  oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having  the error  the noise in the signal they were discovering. And something about that environment    and I've started calling it the  liquid network   where you have lots of different ideas that are together  different backgrounds  different interests  jostling with each other  bouncing off each other    that environment is  in fact  the environment that leads to innovation. The other problem that people have is they like to condense their stories of innovation down to kind of shorter time frames. So they want to tell the story of the  eureka   moment. They want to say   There I was  I was standing there and I had it all suddenly clear in my head.  But in fact  if you go back and look at the historical record  it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods    I call this the  slow hunch.  We've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct and blink like sudden moments of clarity  but in fact  a lot of great ideas linger on  sometimes for decades  in the back of people's minds. They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem  but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them. They spend all this time working on certain problems  but there's another thing lingering there that they're interested in  but they can't quite solve. Darwin is a great example of this. Darwin himself  in his autobiography  tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic  eureka   moment. He's in his study  it's October of       and he's reading Malthus  actually  on population. And all of a sudden  the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says   Ah  at last  I had a theory with which to work.  That's in his autobiography. About a decade or two ago  a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period. And Darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had  every little hunch. And what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany  reading Malthus in October of     . There are passages where you can read it  and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook  from the period before he has this epiphany. And so what you realize is that Darwin  in a sense  had the idea  he had the concept  but was unable of fully thinking it yet. And that is actually how great ideas often happen  they fade into view over long periods of time. Now the challenge for all of us is  how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half life  right  It's hard to go to your boss and say   I have an excellent idea for our organization. It will be useful in     . Could you just give me some time to do that   Now a couple of companies    like Google    they have innovation time off     percent time  where  in a sense  those are hunch cultivating mechanisms in an organization. But that's a key thing. And the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people's hunches  that's what often happens. You have half of an idea  somebody else has the other half  and if you're in the right environment  they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts. So  in a sense  we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property  you know  building barricades  having secretive R D labs  patenting everything that we have  so that those ideas will remain valuable  and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas  and the culture will be more innovative. But I think there's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time  if not more  valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them. And I'll leave you with this story  which I think captures a lot of these values  and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways. It's October of       and Sputnik has just launched  and we're in Laurel Maryland  at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University. And it's Monday morning  and the news has just broken about this satellite that's now orbiting the planet. And of course  this is nerd heaven  right  There are all these physics geeks who are there thinking   Oh my gosh  This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened.  And two of them  two    something researchers at the APL are there at the cafeteria table having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues. And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach. And they start talking  and one of them says   Hey  has anybody tried to listen for this thing  There's this  you know  man made satellite up there in outer space that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal. We could probably hear it  if we tune in.  And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues  and everybody's like   No  I hadn't thought of doing that. That's an interesting idea.  And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception  and he's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office. And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office  and they start kind of noodling around    hacking  as we might call it now. And after a couple of hours  they actually start picking up the signal  because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track. It was right at    MHz  so you could pick it up really easily  because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax  basically. So they made it really easy to find it. So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal  and people start kind of coming into the office and saying   Wow  that's pretty cool. Can I hear  Wow  that's great.  And before long  they think   Well jeez  this is kind of historic. We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this. We should record it.  And so they bring in this big  clunky analog tape recorder and they start recording these little bleep  bleeps. And they start writing the kind of date stamp  time stamps for each little bleep that they record. And they they start thinking   Well gosh  you know  we're noticing small little frequency variations here. We could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling  if we do a little basic math here using the Doppler effect.  And then they played around with it a little bit more  and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties. And they said   Jeez  you know  we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away. That's pretty cool.  And eventually  they get permission    this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description. They get permission to use the new  you know  UNIVAC computer that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL. They run some more of the numbers  and at the end of about three or four weeks  turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the Earth  just from listening to this one little signal  going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do over lunch one morning. A couple weeks later their boss  Frank McClure  pulls them into the room and says   Hey  you guys  I have to ask you something about that project you were working on. You've figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground. Could you go the other way  Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground  if you knew the location of the satellite   And they thought about it and they said   Well  I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here.  So they went back  and they thought about it. And they came back and said   Actually  it'll be easier.  And he said   Oh  that's great. Because see  I have these new nuclear submarines that I'm building. And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of Moscow  if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. So we're thinking  we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean. Could you work on that problem   And that's how GPS was born.    years later  Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology that would create and innovate on top of this open platform  left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it. And now  I guarantee you certainly half of this room  if not more  has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space. And I bet you one of you  if not more  has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last    in the last day or last week  right  And that  I think  is a great case study  a great lesson in the power  the marvelous  kind of unplanned emergent  unpredictable power of open innovative systems. When you build them right  they will be led to completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of. I mean  here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch  this little passion that had developed  then they thought they were fighting the Cold War  and then it turns out they're just helping somebody find a soy latte. That is how innovation happens. Chance favors the connected mind. Thank you very much. I want you to take a trip with me. Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa  and as you drive along  you look off to the side  and this is what you see  you see a field of graves. And you stop  and you get out of your car and you take a picture. And you go into the town  and you inquire   What's going on here   and people are initially reluctant to tell you. And then someone says   These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community.  HIV isn't like other medical conditions  it's stigmatizing. People are reluctant to talk about it    there's a fear associated with it. And I'm going to talk about HIV today  about the deaths  about the stigma. It's a medical story  but more than that  it's a social story. This map depicts the global distribution of HIV. And as you can see  Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection. There are    million people living with HIV in the world today. Of these  two thirds     million are living in sub Saharan Africa. There are  .  million pregnant women in low  and middle income countries living with HIV and of these     percent are in sub Saharan Africa. We talk about things in relative terms. And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV positive mothers. The United States    a large country    each year        mothers with HIV who give birth to a child. But you go to Rwanda    a very small country          mothers with HIV who are pregnant. And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital  outside of Johannesburg in South Africa  and       HIV positive pregnant women giving birth    a hospital the same as a country. And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa  it just pales  because in South Africa  each year         mothers with HIV give birth to children. So we talk about PMTCT  and we refer to PMTCT  prevention of mother to child transmission. I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV positive  she's going to infect her child. The reality is really  very different. In resource rich countries  with all the tests and treatment we currently have  less than two percent of babies are born HIV positive       percent of babies are born HIV negative. And yet  the reality in resource poor countries  in the absence of tests and treatment     percent       percent of children are infected       percent versus two percent    an enormous difference. So these programs    and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk    these prevention programs  simply  they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies  and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children. So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in. It's the drugs she receives to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery. It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex. It's an entire package of services  and it works. So in the United States  since the advent of treatment in the middle of the     s  there's been an    percent decline in the number of HIV infected children. Less than     babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet  still  over         children are born every year in the world today with HIV. What does that mean  It means       children infected each day          children each day  infected with HIV. And where do they come from  Well  less than one comes from the United States. One  on average  comes from Europe.     come from Asia and the Pacific. And each day  a thousand babies    a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa. So again  I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa. And let's look at another map. And here  again  we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors. That thin sliver you see here  that's Africa. And it's the same with nurses. The truth is sub Saharan Africa has    percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers. That means doctors and nurses simply don't have the time to take care of patients. A nurse in a busy clinic will see    to     patients in a day  which leaves her just minutes per patient    minutes per patient. And so when we look at these PMTCT programs  what does it mean  Well  back in       when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug  a nurse  in the course of her few minutes with a patient  would have to counsel for the HIV test  perform the HIV test  explain the results  dispense a single dose of the drug  Nevirapine  explain how to take it  discuss infant feeding options  reinforce infant feeding  and test the baby    in minutes. Well  fortunately since       we've got new treatments  new tests  and we're far more successful  but we don't have any more nurses. And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes. It's not possible    it doesn't work. And so we need to find better ways of providing care. This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa    mothers coming  pregnant and with their babies. These women are here for care  but we know that just doing a test  just giving someone a drug  it's not enough. Meds don't equal medical care. Doctors and nurses  frankly  don't have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand. I'm a doctor    I tell people things to do  and I expect them to follow my guidance    because I'm a doctor  I went to Harvard    but the reality is  if I tell a patient   You should have safer sex. You should always use a condom   and yet  in her relationship  she's not empowered    what's going to happen  If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet  no one in the household knows about her illness  so it's just not going to work. And so we need to do more  we need to do it differently  we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale  which means it can be done everywhere. So  I want to tell you a story    I want to take you on a little trip. Imagine yourself  if you can  you're a young woman in Africa  you're going to the hospital or clinic. You go in for a test and you find out that you're pregnant  and you're delighted. And then they give you another test and they tell you you're HIV positive  and you're devastated. And the nurse takes you into a room  and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby  and you hear none of it. All you're hearing is   I'm going to die  and my baby is going to die.  And then you're out on the street  and you don't know where to go. And you don't know who you can talk to  because the truth is  HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner  your family  anyone in your home  you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support. And this    this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today. But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news. And I want to change the story a little bit. Take the same mother  and the nurse  after she gives her her test  takes her to a room. The door opens and there's a room full of mothers  mothers with babies  and they're sitting  and they're talking  they're listening. They're drinking tea  they're having sandwiches. And she goes inside  and woman comes up to her and says   Welcome to mothers mothers. Have a seat. You're safe here. We're all HIV positive. You're going to be okay. You're going to live. Your baby is going to be HIV negative.  We view mothers as a community's single greatest resource. Mothers take care of the children  take care of the home. So often the men are gone. They're working  or they're not part of the household. Our organization  mothers mothers  enlists women with HIV as care providers. We bring mothers who have HIV  who've been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities  to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team. These mothers  we call them mentor mothers  are able to engage women who  just like themselves  pregnant with babies  have found out about being HIV positive  who need support and education. And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines  how to take care of themselves  how to take care of their babies. Consider  if you needed surgery  you would want the best possible technical surgeon  right  But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life  you'd like to engage someone  someone who's had the procedure. Patients are experts on their own experience  and they can share that experience with others. This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines. So the mothers who work for us  they come from the communities in which they work. They're hired    they're paid as professional members of the health care teams  just like doctors and nurses. And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts  because their money's protected  the men can't take it away from them. They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum based education  training. Now  doctors and nurses    they too get trained. But so often  they only get trained once  so they're not aware of new medicines  new guidelines as they come out. Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained. And so doctors and nurses    they look up to them as experts. Imagine that  a woman  a former patient  being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she's taking care of. Our organization has three goals. The first  to prevent mother to child transmission. The second  keep mothers healthy  keep mothers alive  keep the children alive    no more orphans. And the third  and maybe the most grand  is to find ways to empower women  enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV. So how do we do it  Well  maybe the most important engagement is the one to one  seeing patients one to one  educating them  supporting them  explaining how they can take care of themselves. We go beyond that  we try to bring in the husbands  the partners. In Africa  it's very  very hard to engage men. Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care. But in Rwanda  in one country  they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her    that's the rule. And so the father and the mother  together  go through the counseling and the testing. The father and the mother  together  they get the results. And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. Disclosure is so central to prevention. How do you have safer sex  how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn't been disclosure  Disclosure is so important to treatment  because again  people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly. We also work in groups. Now the groups  it's not like me lecturing  but what happens is women  they come together    under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers    they come together  and they share their personal experiences. And it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves  how to disclose how to take medicines. And then there's the community outreach  engaging women in their communities. If we can change the way households believe and think  we can change the way communities believe and think. And if we can change enough communities  we can change national attitudes. We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV. The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction. We have the medicines  we have the tests  but how do you reduce the stigma  And it's important about disclosure. So  a couple years ago  one of the mentor mothers came back  and she told me a story. She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client  because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status  and she was afraid to go by herself. And so the mentor mother went along with. And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings   I have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive.  And everybody was quiet. And then her oldest brother stood up and said   I too have something to tell you. I'm HIV positive. I've been afraid to tell everybody.  And then this older sister stood up and said   I too am living with the virus  and I've been ashamed.  And then her younger brother stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to throw me out of the family.  And you see where this is going. The last sister stood up and said   I'm also positive. I thought you were going to hate me.  And there they were  all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time. and they are crying and scared. I tell them my story  that I am HIV positive  but my child is HIV negative. I tell them   You are going to make it  and you will raise a healthy baby.  I am proof that there is hope. Mitchell Besser  Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa. And it is a crisis in health care systems. Even as we have more tests and more drugs  we can't reach people  we don't have enough providers. So we talk in terms of what we call task shifting. Task shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it. Typically  it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse. And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses  really than doctors  and so we need to find new paradigm for health care. How do you build a better health care system  We've chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor  a nurse and a mentor mother. And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs  the side effects. They delegate education about infant feeding  family planning  safer sex  actions that nurses simple just don't have time for. So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission. The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health. And our organization helps women across that bridge. The care doesn't stop when the baby's born    we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby  ensuring that they live healthy  successful lives. Our organization works on three levels. The first  at the patient level    mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV  keeping mothers healthy to raise them. The second  communities    empowering women. They become leaders within their communities. They change the way communities think    we need to change attitudes to HIV. We need to change attitudes to women in Africa. We have to do that. And then rework the level of the health care systems  building stronger health care systems. Our health care systems are broken. They're not going to work the way they're currently designed. And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people's behaviors don't have the skills  don't have the time    our mentor mothers do. And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in  we can do that. I started the program in Capetown  South Africa back in     . It was at that point  just the spark of an idea. Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from  I was in the shower at the time    I was alone. The program is now working in nine countries  we have     program sites  we're seeing about         women every month  we're employing       mentor mothers  and last year  they enrolled         HIV positive pregnant women and mothers. That is    percent of the global HIV positive pregnant women       percent of the world. What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is. Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV. Past patients taking care of present patients. And empowerment through employment    reducing stigma. hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS. Each person must know their HIV status. Those who are HIV negative must know how to stay negative. Those who are HIV infected must know how to take care of themselves. HIV positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV negative babies. All of this is possible  if we each contribute to this fight. MB  Simple solutions to complex problems. Mothers caring for mothers. It's transformational. Thank you. I'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV AIDS campaigner. And this is the name of my campaign  SING Campaign. In November of       I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela's       Foundation    that is his HIV AIDS foundation. And       is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island. And that's me with Youssou N'Dour  onstage  having the time of my life. The next day  all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island  where he was going to give a conference to the world's press  standing in front of his former prison cell. You can see the bars of the window there. It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us. In that moment in time  Mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country  that post apartheid Rainbow Nation  a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims  the most vulnerable of all  were women and children. This was a huge impact on my mind  because I am a woman and I am a mother  and I hadn't realized that the HIV AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way. And so I committed    when I left South Africa  when I left Capetown  I told myself   This is going to be something that I have to talk about. I have to serve.  And so  subsequently I participated in every single       event that I could take part in and gave news conferences  interviews  talking and using my platform as a musician  with my commitment to Mandela    out of respect for the tremendous  unbelievable work that he had done. Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela  everyone reveres Nelson Mandela. But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa  his country  the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus  I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there  they would be shocked. I was very  very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat  the founder of Treatment Action Campaign  an incredible campaigner and activist. I met him at a       event. He was wearing a t shirt like the one I wear now. This is a tool    this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV  people who are living with HIV. And in a way because of the stigma  by wearing this t shirt I say   Yes  we can talk about this issue. It doesn't have to be in the closet.  I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization. It's a grassroots campaign with    percent membership being women  most of whom are HIV positive. They work in the field. They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus. They have education programs. They bring out the issues of stigma. It's quite extraordinary what they do. And yes  my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds. A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do  and are still continuing to do in South Africa. So this is my SING Campaign. SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me. I've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years    I went to about    different countries. Here I am in Oslo in Norway  getting a nice  fat check  singing in Hong Kong  trying to get people to raise money. In Johannesburg  I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white  middle class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart  the whole nature  of this terrible tragedy that is taking place  that people are tending to avoid  because they are fatigued  and they really don't quite know what the solutions are. Aaron Motsoaledi  the current health minister  attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him  and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change  which is absolutely necessary. This is in the Scottish Parliament. I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV. And I was showing them my experiences and trying to  again  raise awareness. And once again  in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore. And it's children like this  many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus. I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe    he's the director of UNAIDS. And I'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me  only a few months ago  to become a UNAIDS ambassador. And in this way  I've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach. The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by     . It's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will. This can happen. And here I am with a pregnant woman  who is HIV positive and we're smiling  both of us are smiling  because we're very confident  because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to. And her baby will receive PMTCT  which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus. Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life. It's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic. Now  I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile. This is Avelile    she goes with me wherever I go. I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV AIDS orphans. Avelile's mother had HIV virus    she died from AIDS related illness. Avelile had the virus  she was born with the virus. And here she is at seven years old  weighing no more than a one year old baby. At this point in her life  she's suffering with full blown AIDS and had pneumonia. We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her    an adorable child. The doctors and nurses were phenomenal. They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her. And we didn't know when we left the hospital    because we filmed her story    we didn't know if she was going to survive. So  it was obviously    it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience  this one child  you know  that story. Five months later  we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again. And I'm getting    the hairs on my    I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms. They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you. This is the transformation that took place. Isn't it extraordinary  That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile. And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation. So  I would like to say to you  each one in the audience  if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care  and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals  specifically five and six  should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world    especially in sub Saharan Africa    could you please stand up. I think that's fair to say  it's almost everyone in the hall. Thank you very much. I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question  how can we make digital content graspable  Because you see  on the one hand  there is the digital world and no question  many things are happening there right now. And for us humans  it's not quite material  it's not really there    it's virtual. On the other hand  we humans  we live in a physical world. It's rich  it tastes good  it feels good  it smells good. So the question is  how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical  That's my question. If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity  you can see the tendency  it's getting physical. The question is  what's next  Now  I have three options that I would like to show you. The first one is mass. As humans  we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy. So  could we use that in mobile phones  Let me show you the weight shifting mobile. It is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside  which we can move around  and you can feel where it's heavy. We shift the gravitational center of it. For example  we can augment digital content with physical mass. So you move around the content on a display  but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device. Another thing it's good for is navigation    it can guide you around in a city. It can tell you by its weight   Okay  move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here.  And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time  you have your eyes free to see the city. Now  mass is the first thing  the second thing  that's shape. We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in  our  hands. So if I download an e book and it has    pages    well  they could be thin  right    but if it has     pages  I want to feel that  Harry Potter     it's thick.  Laughter  So let me show you the shape changing mobile. Again  it's a mobile phone shaped box  and this one can change its shape. We can play with the shape itself. For example  it can be thin in your pocket  which we of course want it to be  but then if you hold it in your hand  it can lean towards you  be thick. It's like tapered to the downside. If you change the grasp  it can adjust to that. It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock  it stands. It's fairly simple. Another thing is  sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone  they are bigger than the phone itself. So in that case    like here  there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen    the shape of the phone could tell you   Okay  off the screen right here  there is more content. You can't see it  but it's there.  And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge. The shape is the second thing. The third thing operates on a different level. As humans  we are social  we are empathic  and that's great. Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive  Think of a hamster in the pocket. Well  I can feel it  it's doing all right    I don't have to check it. Let me show you the living mobile phone. So  once again  mobile phone shaped box  but this one  it has a breath and a heartbeat  and it feels very organic. And you can tell  it's relaxed right now. Oh now  missed call  a new call  new girlfriend maybe    very exciting.  Laughter  How do we calm it down  You give it a pat behind the ears  and everything is all right again. So  that's very intuitive  and that's what we want. So  what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us. And I think making it physical is a good way to do that. What's behind that is a postulation  namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future  rather than that  technology  a bit more human. The Hindus say   Nada brahma   one translation of which is   The world is sound.  And in a way  that's true  because everything is vibrating. In fact  all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating. Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies. So you are  in fact  a chord    each of you an individual chord. One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. Your ears can't hear that chord  they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear    octaves. Incidentally  we see just one octave. Your ears are always on    you have no ear lids. They work even when you sleep. The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters. The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that. Ears are made not for hearing  but for listening. Listening is an active skill  whereas hearing is passive  listening is something that we have to work at    it's a relationship with sound. And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught. For example  have you ever considered that there are listening positions  places you can listen from  Here are two of them. Reductive listening is listening  for.  It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant. Men typically listen reductively. So he's saying   I've got this problem.  He's saying   Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next.  That's the way we talk  right guys  Expansive listening  on the other hand  is listening  with   not listening  for.  It's got no destination in mind    it's just enjoying the journey. Women typically listen expansively. If you look at these two  eye contact  facing each other  possibly both talking at the same time. Men  if you get nothing else out of this talk  practice expansive listening  and you can transform your relationships. The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise  surrounding us all the time. Noise like this  according to the European Union  is reducing the health and the quality of life of    percent of the population of Europe. Two percent of the population of Europe    that's    million people    are having their sleep devastated by noise like that. Noise kills         people a year in Europe. It's a really big problem. Now  when you were little  if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it  you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum. These days  you can do a similar thing  it just looks a bit cooler. It looks a bit like this. The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues. The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined   schizophonia.  It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear. So  we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us. I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia. The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression. We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this. Listen to this    this is an uncompressed piece of music. And now the same piece of music with    percent of the data removed. I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two. There is a cost of compression. It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data. You're having to imagine it. It's not good for you in the long run. The third problem with headphones is this  deafness    noise induced hearing disorder. Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another  but really worryingly     percent    roughly one in six    of American teenagers suffer from noise induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse. One study at an American university found that    percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse. We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people. Now that's a really serious problem. I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children  please. Professional hearing protectors are great  I use some all the time. If you're going to use headphones  buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don't have to have it so loud. If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice  it's too loud. And thirdly  if you're in bad sound  it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it. Protect your ears in that way. Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out. WWB  Wind  water  birds    stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events  all of it very healthy  all of it sound that we evolved to over the years. Seek those sounds out  they're good for you and so it this. Silence is beautiful. The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence. I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art. Have a foreground  a background  all in beautiful proportion. It's fun to get into designing with sound. If you can't do it yourself  get a professional to do it for you. Sound design is the future  and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds. I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities  eight ways sound can improve health. First  ultrasound  we're very familiar with it from physical therapy  it's also now being used to treat cancer. Lithotripsy    saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high intensity sound. Sound healing is a wonderful modality. It's been around for thousands of years. I do urge you to explore this. There are great things being done there  treating now autism  dementia and other conditions. And music  of course. Just listening to music is good for you  if it's music that's made with good intention  made with love  generally. Devotional music  good    Mozart  good. There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy. And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved. First of all  listen consciously. I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that. It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension. Secondly  get in touch with making some sound    create sound. The voice is the instrument we all play  and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice  Get trained  learn to sing  learn to play an instrument. Musicians have bigger brains    it's true. You can do this in groups as well. It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia  to make music and sound in a group of people  whichever style you enjoy particularly. And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us. Protect your ears  Yes  absolutely. Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work. And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on. So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound. My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things  we will take a very big step in that direction. So I urge you to take that path. I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong  which is very good for you. I wish you sound health. I got up this morning at      a.m. after going to sleep at       a.m. I was awakened once during the night. My heart rate was    beats per minute    my blood pressure      over   . I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday  so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated. I had about     milligrams of caffeine  zero of alcohol. And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index  or the NPI     is a reassuring  .  . We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise  manage  govern  search. I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect  learn  remember and want to improve. A few years ago  Kevin Kelly  my partner  and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self tracking that went far beyond the ordinary  familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day. People were tracking their food via Twitter  their kids' diapers on their iPhone. They were making detailed journals of their spending  their mood  their symptoms  their treatments. Now  we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle    the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices  the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing  and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors. This little black dot there is a  D accelerometer. It tracks your movement through space. It is  as you can see  very small and also very cheap. They're now down to well under a dollar a piece  and they're going into all kinds of devices. But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this. This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device    among early adopters at the moment    the Fitbit. This tracks your activity and also your sleep. It has just that sensor in it. You're probably familiar with the Nike  system. I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor. It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell. And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor. This is the strap that people use to transmit heart rate data to their Nike  system. This is a beautiful  new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data  not just whether you're asleep or awake  but also your phase of sleep    deep sleep  light sleep  REM sleep. The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there. The rest of it is the bedside console  just for reference  this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago    I mean  really until now. And this is the sleep tracking system of today. This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C. Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler  but the top is a very small GPS transceiver  which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident  giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors. Now  we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world    these tiny sensors that gather data in nature  the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used  and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute. But we think of these tools as pointing outward  as windows and I'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors. So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement  we also think about how they can be useful for self improvement  for self discovery  self awareness  self knowledge. Here's a biometric device  a pair of Apple Earbuds. Last year  Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation  heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds. What is this for  What should it be for  Some people will say it's for biometric security. Some people will say it's for public health research. Some people will say it's for avant garde marketing research. I'd like to tell you that it's also for self knowledge. And the self isn't the only thing  it's not even most things. The self is just our operation center  our consciousness  our moral compass. So  if we want to act more effectively in the world  we have to get to know ourselves better. Thank you. We live in in a remarkable time  the age of genomics. Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA. Your sequence and mine are slightly different. That's why we look different. I've got brown eyes  you might have blue or gray. But it's not just skin deep. The headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases  maybe even shape our personality  or give us mental disorders. Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies. And yet  I would like to think that I am more than my genes. What do you guys think  Are you more than your genes  I think some people agree with me. I think we should make a statement. I think we should say it all together. All right   I'm more than my genes     all together. Everybody  I am more than my genes. Sebastian Seung  What am I  I am my connectome. Now  since you guys are really great  maybe you can humor me and say this all together too. Right. All together now. Everybody  I am my connectome. SS  That sounded great. You know  you guys are so great  you don't even know what a connectome is  and you're willing to play along with me. I could just go home now. Well  so far only one connectome is known  that of this tiny worm. Its modest nervous system consists of just     neurons. And in the     s and '  s  a team of scientists mapped all       connections between the neurons. In this diagram  every node is a neuron  and every line is a connection. This is the connectome of the worm C. elegans. Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains     billion neurons and        times as many connections. There's a diagram like this for your brain  but there's no way it would fit on this slide. Your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters. That's a lot of information. What's in that information  We don't know for sure  but there are theories. Since the   th century  neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories    the information that makes you  you    maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain's neurons. And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity    maybe your personality and your intellect    maybe they're also encoded in the connections between your neurons. And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis  I am my connectome. I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true  I just want you to remember it. And in fact  we don't know if this hypothesis is correct  because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it. Finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor. And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own  we need more sophisticated technologies  that are automated  that will speed up the process of finding connectomes. And in the next few minutes  I'll tell you about some of these technologies  which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators. Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before. You can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes. They extend long and delicate branches  and in short  they look like trees. But this is just a single neuron. In order to find connectomes  we have to see all the neurons at the same time. So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri  who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman at Harvard University. Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain. And we're zooming in by a factor of         times to obtain the resolution  so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time. Except  you still may not really recognize them  and that's because we have to work in three dimensions. If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up  we get a three dimensional image. And still  you may not see the branches. So we start at the top  and we color in the cross section of one branch in red  and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice. And we keep on doing that  slice after slice. If we continue through the entire stack  we can reconstruct the three dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron. And we can do that for another neuron in green. And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations  and these are what are called synapses. Let's zoom in on one synapse  and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron. You should see small circles    these are called vesicles. They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter. And so when the green neuron wants to communicate  it wants to send a message to the red neuron  it spits out neurotransmitter. At the synapse  the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone. So you see how to find a synapse. How can we find an entire connectome  Well  we take this three dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three dimensional coloring book. We color every neuron in  in a different color  and then we look through all of the images  find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse. If we can do that throughout all the images  we could find a connectome. Now  at this point  you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses. And so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience  how are the brains of men and women different  According to this self help book  guys brains are like waffles  they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes. Girls' brains are like spaghetti  everything in their life is connected to everything else. You guys are laughing  but you know  this book changed my life. But seriously  what's wrong with this  You already know enough to tell me    what's wrong with this statement  It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl  everyone's brains are like spaghetti. Or maybe really  really fine capellini with branches. Just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate  one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches. One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons  because there can be synapses at these points of contact. By now  you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is. And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you. I assure you  this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side. So  here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron. And you can tell that  really  only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube. And a neuron  well  that's smaller than brain. And that's just a mouse brain    it's a lot smaller than a human brain. So when show my friends this  sometimes they've told me   You know  Sebastian  you should just give up. Neuroscience is hopeless.  Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye  you don't really see how complex it is  but when you use a microscope  finally the hidden complexity is revealed. In the   th century  the mathematician and philosopher  Blaise Pascal  wrote of his dread of the infinite  his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space. And  as a scientist  I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings    too much information  professor. But may I  I feel curiosity  and I feel wonder  but at times I have also felt despair. Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite  It's absurd. How could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this  And yet  I persist in this quixotic endeavor. And indeed  these days I harbor new hopes. Someday  a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images. And some day  artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome. I do not know  but I hope that I will live to see that day  because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time. It will take the work of generations to succeed. At the present time  my collaborators and I  what we're aiming for is much more modest    just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain. But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connectome. For now  let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis  that it's actually worth taking seriously. As you grow during childhood and age during adulthood  your personal identity changes slowly. Likewise  every connectome changes over time. What kinds of changes happen  Well  neurons  like trees  can grow new branches  and they can lose old ones. Synapses can be created  and they can be eliminated. And synapses can grow larger  and they can grow smaller. Second question  what causes these changes  Well  it's true. To some extent  they are programmed by your genes. But that's not the whole story  because there are signals  electrical signals  that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch. These signals are called neural activity. And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts  feelings and perceptions  our mental experiences. And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change. And if you put those two facts together  it means that your experiences can change your connectome. And that's why every connectome is unique  even those of genetically identical twins. The connectome is where nature meets nurture. And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome    an idea that you may find empowering. What's in this picture  A cool and refreshing stream of water  you say. What else is in this picture  Do not forget that groove in the Earth called the stream bed. Without it  the water would not know in which direction to flow. And with the stream  I would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity. Neural activity is constantly changing. It's like the water of the stream  it never sits still. The connections of the brain's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows. And so the connectome is like bed of the stream  but the metaphor is richer than that  because it's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water  but over long timescales  the water also reshapes the bed of the stream. And as I told you just now  neural activity can change the connectome. And if you'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights  I will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis    or so neuroscientists think    of thoughts  feelings and perceptions. And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness. Neural activity is its water  and the connectome is its bed. So let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science. Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work. How will we go about testing the hypothesis  I am my connectome   Well  I propose a direct test. Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes. Consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements  like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata. According to a theory that dates back to the   th century  such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain. Because  if the first neurons in the chain are activated  through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons  which are activated  and so on down the line  like a chain of falling dominoes. And this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements. So one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes. But it won't be easy  because they're not going to look like this. They're going to be scrambled up. So we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain. And if we can do that  the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall. And if that were successful  that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome. What a mess    have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this  I hope not. But if you have  you know it's very easy to make a mistake. The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain. Can anyone guess  what's the total length of wires in your brain  I'll give you a hint. It's a big number. I estimate  millions of miles  all packed in your skull. And if you appreciate that number  you can easily see there is huge potential for mis wiring of the brain. And indeed  the popular press loves headlines like   Anorexic brains are wired differently   or  Autistic brains are wired differently.  These are plausible claims  but in truth  we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true. And so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis wiring of the brain  to see mental disorders in connectomes. Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication. Philosophers know this game very well. If you believe that I am my connectome  I think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome. I mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species. One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics. If you pay         dollars  you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse  awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you. Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality  calling them fools  Or will they someday chuckle over our graves  I don't know    I prefer to test their beliefs  scientifically. I propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain. We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing. The question is  has that damage erased the connectome  If it has  there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains. Resurrection might succeed for the body  but not for the mind. On the other hand  if the connectome is still intact  we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily. I've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small  and propels us to the world of the far future. Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history. As we evolved from our ape like ancestors on the African savanna  what distinguished us was our larger brains. We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies. Eventually  these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains. I believe that this voyage of self discovery is not just for scientists  but for all of us. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today. Thank you. So I want to tell you a story    an encouraging story    about addressing desperation  depression and despair in Afghanistan  and what we have learned from it  and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead    in the future    and how to participate again in everyday life. So  I am a Jungian psychoanalyst  and I went to Afghanistan in January       by chance  on an assignment for Medica Mondiale. Jung in Afghanistan    you get the picture. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world  and    percent of the people are illiterate. War and malnutrition kills people together with hope. You may know this from the media  but what you may not know is that the average age of the Afghan people is    years old  which means they grow up in such an environment and    I repeat myself    in    years of war. So this translates into ongoing violence  foreign interests  bribery  drugs  ethnic conflicts  bad health  shame  fear and cumulative traumatic experiences. Local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non governmental organizations. And people had hope  yes  but until they realized their situation worsens every day    either because they are being killed or because  somehow  they are poorer than eight years ago. One figure for that     percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition. Yet  there is hope. One day a man told me   My future does not look brilliant  but I want to have a brilliant future for my son.  This is a picture I took in       walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul  and for me it's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation. So  doctors prescribe medication. And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads. Military collect weapons  and depression stays intact. Why  Because people don't have tools to cope with it  to get over it. So  soon after my arrival  I had confirmed something which I had already known  that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe  yes. However  what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds    they are universal. And the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context. After a counseling session  a woman said to me   Because you have felt me  I can feel myself again  and I want to participate again in my family life.  This was very important  because the family is central in Afghans' social system. No one can survive alone. And if people feel used  worthless and ashamed  because something horrible has happened to them  then they retreat  and they fall into social isolation  and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones  because they do not want to burden them. And very often violence is a way to cope with it. Traumatized people also easily lose control    symptoms are hyper arousal and memory flashbacks    so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly  suddenly  and they cannot control it. To compensate this loss of inner control  they try to control the outside  very understandably    mostly the family    and unfortunately  this fits very well into the traditional side  regressive side  repressive side  restrictive side of the cultural context. So  husbands start beating wives  mothers and fathers beat their children  and afterward  they feel awful. They did not want to do this  it just happened    they lost control. The desperate try to restore order and normality  and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence  it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt. And partly this is already happening. So everybody needs a sense for the future  and the Afghan sense of the future is shattered. But let me repeat the words of the woman.  Because you have felt me  I can feel myself again.  So the key here is empathy. Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you. Somebody has to feel how you felt. And somebody has to see you and listen to you. Everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true  and this only goes with another person. So everybody must be able to say   This happened to me  and it did this with me  but I'm able to live with it  to cope with it  and to learn from it. And I want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children  and I will not marry off my    year old daughter      what happens too often in Afghanistan. So something can be done  even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan. And I started thinking about a counseling program. But  of course  I needed help and funds. And one evening  I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul  and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan. And I explained to him quickly  I would train psycho social counselors  I would open centers  and I explained to him why. This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said   If you want to do this  call me.  At that time  it was the head of Caritas Germany. So  I was able to launch a three year project with Caritas Germany  and we trained    Afghan women and men  and we opened    counseling centers in Kabul. This was our sign    it's hand painted  and we had    all over Kabul. Eleven thousand people came    more than that. And    percent regained their lives. This was a very exciting time  developing this with my wonderful Afghan team. And they are working with me up to today. We developed a culturally sensitive psycho social counseling approach. So  from      up until today  a substantial change and step forward has been taking place. The European Union delegation in Kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the Ministry of Public Health  to lobby this approach    we succeeded. We revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho social care and psycho social counselors to the system. This means  certainly  to retrain all health staff. But for that  we already have the training manuals  which are approved by the Ministry and moreover  this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan. So we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces  and you are the first to see the results. We wanted to know if what is being done is effective. And here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression  moderate and severe. And the red line is the treatment as usual    medication with a medical doctor. And all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse. And the green line is treatment with psycho social counseling only  without medication. And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away  and the psycho social stress has dropped significantly  which is explicable  because you cannot take away the psycho social stresses  but you can learn how to cope with them. So this makes us very happy  because now we also have some evidence that this is working. So here you see  this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan  and every morning it looks like this all over. And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients  but now this will change. They go to the clinics  because they want to cure their immediate symptoms  and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions  develop their resources  learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future. And I would like to share one short vignette. One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor   If we were to have met some years ago  then we would have killed each other. And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future.  And another counselor said to me after the training   You know  I never knew why I survived the killings in my village  but now I know  because I am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan.  So I believe this kept me running. And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation. And also    I think    without psycho social therapy  and without considering this in all humanitarian projects  we cannot build up civil societies. I thought it was an idea worth spreading  and I think it must be  can be  could be replicated elsewhere. I thank you for your attention. Welcome to Thailand. Now  when I was a young man       years ago  the country was very  very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty. We decided to do something about it  but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program. But we began with a family planning program  following a very successful maternal child health activity  sets of activities. So basically  no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive. So the first step  get to the children  get to the mothers  and then follow up with family planning. Not just child mortality alone  you need also family planning. Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it. In my country  that was the case in     . Seven children per family    tremendous growth at  .  percent. There was just no future. We needed to reduce the population growth rate. So we said   Let's do it.  The women said   We agree. We'll use pills  but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills   and we had very  very few doctors. We didn't take no as an answer  we took no as a question. We went to the nurses and the midwives  who were also women  and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill. That was wonderful  but it covered only    percent of the country. What do we do for the other    percent    leave them alone and say   Well  they're not medical personnel.  No  we decided to do a bit more. So we went to the ordinary people that you saw. Actually  below that yellow sign    I wish they hadn't wiped that  because there was  Coca Cola  there. We were so much bigger than Coca Cola in those days. And no difference  the people they chose were the people we chose. They were well known in the community  they knew that customers were always right  and they were terrific  and they practiced their family planning themselves. So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country  in every village of the country. So there we are. We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution. Wherever there were people    and you can see boats with the women  selling things    here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives    wherever you find people  you'll find contraceptives in Thailand. And then we decided  why not get to religion because in the Philippines  the Catholic Church was pretty strong  and Thai people were Buddhist. We went to them and they said   Look  could you help us   I'm there    the one in blue  not the yellow    holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family. And this picture was sent throughout the country. So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves. And the women were saying   No wonder we have no side effects. It's been blessed.  That was their perception. And then we went to teachers. You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place. So we went to the teachers. Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet    A  B for birth  C for condom  I for IUD  V for vasectomy. And then we had a snakes and ladders game  where you throw dice. If you land on anything pro family planning  you move ahead. Like   Mother takes the pill every night. Very good  mother. Move ahead. Uncle buys a condom. Very good  uncle. Move ahead. Uncle gets drunk  doesn't use condom. Come back  start again.  Again  education  class entertainment. And the kids were doing it in school too. We had relay races with condoms  we had children's condom blowing championship. And before long  the condom was know as the girl's best friend. In Thailand  for poor people  diamonds don't make it    so the condom is the girl's best friend. We introduced our first microcredit program in       and the women who organized it said   We only want to lend to women who practice family planning. If you're pregnant  take care of your pregnancy. If you're not pregnant  you can take a loan out from us.  And that was run by them. And after       years  it's still going on. It's a part of the Village Development Bank  it's not a real bank  but it's a fund    microcredit. And we didn't need a big organization to run it    it was run by the villagers themselves. And you probably hardly see a Thai man there  it's always women  women  women  women. And then we thought we'd help America  because America's been helping everyone  whether they want help or not. And this is on the Fourth of July. We decided to provide vasectomy to all men  but in particular  American men to the front of the queue  right up to the Ambassador's residence during his  unclear . And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it    very appropriate room. And since it was near lunch time  they said   All right  we'll give you some lunch. Of course  it must be American cola. You get two brands  Coke and Pepsi. And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog.  And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic. And here is this  then  young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID. Obviously  he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten  and he was very happy. It made a lot of news in America  and it angered some people also. I said   Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you.  And what happened  In all this thing  from seven children to  .  children  population growth rate of  .  to  . . You could call it the Coca Cola approach if you like    it was exactly the same thing. I'm not sure whether Coca Cola followed us  or we followed Coca Cola  but we're good friends. And so that's the case of everyone joining in. We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors. But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior. Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand  and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS. But unfortunately  the government was in denial  denial  denial. So our work wasn't affected. So I thought   Well  if you can't go to the government  go to the military.  So I went to the military and asked to borrow     radio stations. They have more than the government  and they've got more guns than the government. So I asked them  could they help us in our fight against HIV. And after I gave them statistics  they said   Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations  television stations.  And that's when we went onto the airwaves. And then we got a new prime minister soon after that. And he said   Mechai  could you come and join   He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot. So I said   Okay.  He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty fold. Every ministry  even judges  had to be involved in AIDS education    everyone    and we said the public  institutions  religious institutions  schools    everyone was involved. And here  every media person had to be trained for HIV. And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money. So they were happy with that. And then AIDS education in all schools  starting from university. And these are high school kids teaching high school kids. And the best teachers were the girls  not the boys  and they were terrific. And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa. And then we went down one more step. These are primary school kids    third  fourth grade    going to every household in the village  every household in the whole of Thailand  giving AIDS information and a condom to every household  given by these young kids. And no parents objected  because we were trying to save lives  and this was a lifesaver. And we said   Everyone needs to be involved.  So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work  and dead customers don't buy. So they all trained. And then we have this Captain Condom  with his Harvard MBA  going to schools and night spots. And they loved him. You need a symbol of something. In every country  every program  you need a symbol  and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA. And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets    everywhere  everywhere. In taxis  you get condoms. And also  in traffic  the policemen give you condoms    our  cops and rubbers  programs. So  can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms  Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely  I see them standing around right now  everywhere. Imagine if they had condoms  giving out to all sorts of people. And then  new change  we had hair bands  clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season. And these were the condoms that we introduced. One says   Weapon of mass protection.  We found    you know    somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction  but we have found the weapon of mass protection  the condom. And then it says here  with the American flag   Don't leave home without it.  But I have some to give out afterward. But let me warn you  these are Thai sized  so be very careful. And so you can see that condoms can do so many things. Look at this    I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also. Stop global warming  use condoms. And then this is the picture I mentioned to you    the weapon of mass protection. And let the next Olympics save some lives. Why just run around  And then finally  in Thailand we're Buddhist  we don't have a God  so instead  we say   In rubber we trust.  So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people. We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools  because alcohol impairs judgment. And then what happened  After all this time  everybody joined in. According to the U.N.  new cases of HIV declined by    percent  and according to the World Bank   .  million lives were saved. Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today. So it just showed you  you could do something about it.    percent of the funding came from Thailand. There was political commitment  some financial commitment  and everybody joined in the fight. So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses. We all need to help. And then we decided to help people out of poverty  now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way    this time  not with government alone  but in cooperation with the business community. Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit. Those are the things to be provided by the business community. We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs  little business people. The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise. So  that was done. The money goes from the company into the village via tree planting. It's not a free gift. They plant the trees  and the money goes into their microcredit fund  which we call the Village Development Bank. Everybody joins in  and they feel they own the bank  because they have brought the money in. And before you can borrow the money  you need to be trained. And we believe if you want to help the poor  those who are living in poverty  access to credit must be a human right. Access to credit must be a human right. Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty. And then before getting a loan  you must be trained. Here's what we call a  barefoot MBA   teaching people how to do business so that  when they borrow money  they'll succeed with the business. These are some of the businesses  mushrooms  crabs  vegetables  trees  fruits  and this is very interesting    Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits  this is a village sponsored by Nike. They said   They should stop making shoes and clothes. Make these better  because we can afford them.  And then we have silk  Thai silk. Now we're making Scottish tartans  as you can see on the left  to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors. So anyone sitting in and watching TV  get in touch with me. And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand     Coffee and Condoms.  See  Starbucks you awake  we keep you awake and alive. That's the difference. Can you imagine  at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms  You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. And then now  finally in education  we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone. We call this our School Based Integrated Rural Development. And it's a center  a focal point for economic and social development. Re do the school  make it serve the community needs. And here is a bamboo building    all of them are bamboo. This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo. And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very  very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome. And we use vegetables around the school ground  so they raise their own vegetables. And then  finally  I firmly believe  if we want the MDGs to work    the Millennium Development Goals    we need to add family planning to it. Of course  child mortality first and then family planning    everyone needs family planning service    it's underutilized. So we have now found the weapon of mass protection. And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives. And then  finally  that is our network. And these are our Thai tulips. Thank you very much indeed. So  I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years. But before I do that  I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics  which require huge amounts of energy to create and  because of their disposal issues  are slowly poisoning our planet. I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years. Not like that.  Laughter  We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials  which perform a lot like plastics during their use  but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives. But first  I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category. This is a material you all know is Styrofoam  but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff. In a single cubic foot of this material    about what would come around your computer or large television    you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol. Yet  after just a few weeks of use  you'll throw this material in the trash. And this isn't just found in packaging.    billion dollars of this material is produced every year  in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops. And that's not the only place it's found. The EPA estimates  in the United States  by volume  this material occupies    percent of our landfills. Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment    on the side of the road or next to a river. If it's not picked up by a human  like me and you  it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years. Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans  like in the great plastic gyre  where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits  but they're not really going away. They're not biologically compatible. They're basically fouling up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems. And because these materials are so prolific  because they're found in so many places  there's one other place you'll find this material  styrene  which is made from benzene  a known carcinogen. You'll find it inside of you. So  for all these reasons  I think we need better materials  and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials. The first is feedstocks. Today  we use a single feedstock  petroleum  to heat our homes  power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you. We recognize this is a finite resource  and it's simply crazy to do this  to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package. Second of all  we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials. I say far less  because    percent isn't going to cut it. We should be talking about half  a quarter  one tenth the energy content. And lastly  and I think perhaps most importantly  we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature's recycling system. This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years. I fit into it  you fit into it  and a hundred years tops  my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing. Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years. This is crazy. But nature provides us with a really good model here. When a tree's done using its leaves    its solar collectors  these amazing molecular photon capturing devices    at the end of a season  it doesn't pack them up  take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves. It just drops them  the shortest distance possible  to the forest floor  where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil. And this gets us back to the mushrooms. Because in nature  mushrooms are the recycling system. And what we've discovered is  by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen    analogous to its root structure  it's called mycelium    we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics. Now  mycelium is an amazing material  because it's a self assembling material. It actually takes things we would consider waste    things like seed husks or woody biomass    and can transform them into a chitinous polymer  which you can form into almost any shape. In our process  we basically use it as a glue. And by using mycelium as a glue  you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry  and you can create materials with many different properties  materials that are insulating  fire resistant  moisture resistant  vapor resistant    materials that can absorb impacts  that can absorb acoustical impacts. But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts  not petroleum. And because they're made of natural materials  they are     percent compostable in you own backyard. So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials. The first is selecting a feedstock  preferably something that's regional  that's in your area  right    local manufacturing. The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool  physically filling an enclosure  a mold  in whatever shape you want to get. Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles  and that's where the magic happens  because the organism is doing the work in this process  not the equipment. The final step is  of course  the product  whether it's a packaging material  a table top  or building block. Our vision is local manufacturing  like the local food movement  for production. So we've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts. If you're in China  you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull. If you're in Northern Europe or North America  you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls. We then process these husks with some basic equipment. And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale. So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas  in this case. It's a waste product. And what they're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system  which cleans  cooks  cools and pasteurizes these materials  while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium. This gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape  though today we're making corner blocks. And it's when this lid goes on the part  that the magic really starts. Because the manufacturing process is our organism. It'll actually begin to digest these wastes and  over the next five days  assemble them into biocomposites. Our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark  quietly self assembling materials    and everything from building materials to  in this case  a packaging corner block. So I've said a number of times that we grow materials. And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens. So my team has taken five days worth of growth  a typical growth cycle for us  and condensed it into a    second time lapse. And I want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen  because  over the five day period  what they do is extend out and through this material  using the energy that's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix. This matrix self assembles  growing through and around the particles  making millions and millions of tiny fibers. And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest  actually become part of the final  physical composite. So in front of your eyes  this part just self assembled. It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days. But it's much faster than conventional farming. The last step  of course  is application. In this case  we've grown a corner block. A major Fortune     furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment. They used to use a plastic packaging buffer  but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material. Best of all  when it gets to the customer  it's not trash. They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing  and it's going to improve the local soil. So  why mycelium  The first reason is local open feedstocks. You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls  because you have multiple choices. The next is self assembly  because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process. You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility. So you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world. Biological yield is really important. And because     percent of what we put in the tool become the final product  even the parts that aren't digested become part of the structure  we're getting incredible yield rates. Natural polymers  well ... I think that's what's most important  because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years  in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans. They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great. And while  today  we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging is going to be here in        years  what I want to guarantee is that in        years  our descendants  our children's children  will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth. And I think that can be some really good news. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about prosperity  about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity. And not just us  but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished. And hope actually is at the heart of this. In fact  the Latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity.  Pro speras    speras   hope    in accordance with our hopes and expectations. The irony is  though  that we have cashed out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth. And we've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope    running down resources  cutting down rainforests  spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico  changing the climate    and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession. And recession  of course  isn't exactly a recipe for hope either  as we're busy finding out. So we're caught in a kind of trap. It's a dilemma  a dilemma of growth. We can't live with it  we can't live without it. Trash the system or crash the planet    it's a tough choice  it isn't much of a choice. And our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently. Now I haven't got anything against efficiency. And I think we are a clever species sometimes. But I think we should also just check the numbers  take a reality check here. So I want you to imagine a world  in       of around nine billion people  all aspiring to Western incomes  Western lifestyles. And I want to ask the question    and we'll give them that two percent hike in income  in salary each year as well  because we believe in growth. And I want to ask the question  how far and how fast would be have to move  How clever would we have to be  How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets  And here in my chart    on the left hand side is where we are now. This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment. It's around about     grams of carbon. In the world I describe to you  we have to be right over here at the right hand side at six grams of carbon. It's a     fold improvement  and that is    times further and faster than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history. Maybe we can do it  maybe it's possible    who knows  Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere  which is what we're going to need to be doing by the end of the century. But shouldn't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement  So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics. It's a bit complex  and I apologize for that. What I'll try and do  is I'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms. So it looks a little bit like this. Firms produce goods for households    that's us    and provide us with incomes  and that's even better  because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services. That's called the circular flow of the economy. It looks harmless enough. I just want to highlight one key feature of this system  which is the role of investment. Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies  but it plays an absolutely vital role. And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth. It does this in a couple of ways    chasing productivity  which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff. But I want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty  the production and consumption of novelty. Joseph Schumpeter called this  the process of creative destruction.  It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty  continually chasing expanding consumer markets  consumer goods  new consumer goods. And this  this is where it gets interesting  because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty. We love new stuff    new material stuff for sure    but also new ideas  new adventures  new experiences. But the materiality matters too  because in every society that anthropologists have looked at  material stuff operates as a kind of language    a language of goods  a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories    stories  for example  about how important we are. Status driven  conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty. And here  all of a sudden  we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic    the economic institutions  and who we are as people  locked together to drive an engine of growth. And this engine is not just economic value  it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system  driven by our own insatiable appetites  driven in fact by a sense of anxiety. Adam Smith      years ago  spoke about our desire for a life without shame. A life without shame  in his day  what that meant was a linen shirt  and today  well  you still need the shirt  but you need the hybrid car  the HDTV  two holidays a year in the sun  the netbook and iPad  the list goes on    an almost inexhaustible supply of goods  driven by this anxiety. And even if we don't want them  we need to buy them  because  if we don't buy them  the system crashes. And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades  we've expanded the money supply  expanded credit and debt  so that people can keep buying stuff. And of course  that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis. But this    I just want to show you some data here. This is what it looks like  essentially  this credit and debt system  just for the U.K. This was the last    years before the crash  and you can see there  consumer debt rose dramatically. It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis. And in the mean time  personal savings absolutely plummeted. The savings ratio  net savings  were below zero in the middle of       just before the crash. This is people expanding debt  drawing down their savings  just to stay in the game. This is a strange  rather perverse  story  just to put it in very simple terms. It's a story about us  people  being persuaded to spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about. But before we consign ourselves to despair  maybe we should just go back and say   Did we get this right  Is this really how people are  Is this really how economies behave   And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies. The first one is in the crisis itself. In the crisis  in the recession  what do people want to do  They want to hunker down  they want to look to the future. They want to spend less and save more. But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view. Keynes called this the  paradox of thrift     saving slows down recovery. And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt  to draw down our own savings even further  just so that we can get the show back on the road  so we can keep this growth based economy going. It's an anomaly  it's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people. Here's another one    completely different one  Why is it that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change  very  very simple things like buying energy efficient appliances  putting in efficient lights  turning the lights off occasionally  insulating our homes  These things save carbon  they save energy  they save us money. So is it that  though they make perfect economic sense  we don't do them  Well  I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago. It was a Sunday evening  Sunday afternoon  and it was just after    actually  to be honest  too long after    we had moved into a new house. And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping  installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts. And my  then  five year old daughter was helping me in the way that five year olds do. And we'd been doing this for a while  when she turned to me very solemnly and said   Will this really keep out the giraffes    Here they are  the giraffes.  You can hear the five year old mind working. These ones  interestingly  are     miles north of here outside Barrow in Furness in Cumbria. Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather. But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me  because it suddenly became clear to me why we don't do the blindingly obvious things. We're too busy keeping out the giraffes    putting the kids on the bus in the morning  getting ourselves to work on time  surviving email overload and shop floor politics  foraging for groceries  throwing together meals  escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime time TV or TED online  getting from one end of the day to the other  keeping out the giraffes. What is the objective   What is the objective of the consumer   Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written    years ago.  It is   she said   to help create the social world and find a credible place in it.  That is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives  and it's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model. So who are we  Who are these people  Are we these novelty seeking  hedonistic  selfish individuals  Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt's lovely  lovely sketch here  Well psychology actually says there is a tension    a tension between self regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors. And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots  so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances    fight or flight. But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings. And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view  another tension between novelty seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation. Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself. Tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups. So here  all of a sudden  we're looking at a map of the human heart. And it reveals to us  suddenly  the crux of the matter. What we've done is we've created economies. We've created systems  which systematically privilege  encourage  one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded. And in the same token  the solution becomes clear  because this isn't  therefore  about changing human nature. It isn't  in fact  about curtailing possibilities. It is about opening up. It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human  recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within. What does all this mean for economics  What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche  Well  it might look a little bit like the       community interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States  enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart    companies  in fact  like this one  Ecosia. And I just want to  very quickly  show you this. Ecosia is an Internet search engine. Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search. And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way. So we can do that here    we can just put in a little search term. There you go  Oxford  that's where we are. See what comes up. The difference with Ecosia though is that  in Ecosia's case  it draws the revenues in the same way  but it allocates    percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon. And we're going to do it. We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk. In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession  that's the page to go to. And what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia  and Ecosia is giving    percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project. It's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources. It's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy. It's a form  if you like  of ecological altruism    perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that. Whatever it is  whatever this new economy is  what we need the economy to do  in fact  is to put investment back into the heart of the model  to re conceive investment. Only now  investment isn't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth. Investment has to be a different beast. Investment has to be  in the new economy  protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends. It has to be about transition. It has to be investing in low carbon technologies and infrastructures. We have to invest  in fact  in the idea of a meaningful prosperity  providing capabilities for people to flourish. And of course  this task has material dimensions. It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food  clothing and shelter. But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this. It has social and psychological aims    family  friendship  commitments  society  participating in the life of that society. And this too requires investment  investment    for example  in places    places where we can connect  places where we can participate  shared spaces  concert halls  gardens  public parks  libraries  museums  quiet centers  places of joy and celebration  places of tranquility and contemplation  sites for the  cultivation of a common citizenship   in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase. An investment    investment  after all  is just such a basic economic concept    is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future  a shared present and a common future. And we need that relationship to reflect  to reclaim hope. So let me come back  with this sense of hope  to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door. What can we offer those people  It's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty. It's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations. And it's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations  a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth based model. So this is not just a Western post materialist fantasy. In fact  an African philosopher wrote to me  when  Prosperity Without Growth  was published  pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional African concept of ubuntu. Ubuntu says   I am because we are.  Prosperity is a shared endeavor. Its roots are long and deep    its foundations  I've tried to show  exist already  inside each of us. So this is not about standing in the way of development. It's not about overthrowing capitalism. It's not about trying to change human nature. What we're doing here is we're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose. And at the heart of that economics  we're placing a more credible  more robust  and more realistic vision of what it means to be human. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  While they're taking the podium away  just a quick question. First of all  economists aren't supposed to be inspiring  so you may need to work on the tone a little. Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this  I mean  can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying   GDP fell two percent this year. Good news  We're actually all happier  and a country's more beautiful  and our lives are better.  Tim Jackson  Well that's clearly not what you're doing. You're not making news out of things falling down. You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing. Can I picture politicians doing it  Actually  I already am seeing a little bit of it. When we first started this kind of work  politicians would stand up  treasury spokesmen would stand up  and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves. And actually in the period through which we've been working over the last    years    partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics    actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world. CA  But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together  or is it going to be more just civil society and companies  TJ  It has to be companies. It has to be civil society. But it has to have political leadership. This is a kind of agenda  which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma  because they're hooked on the growth model themselves. But actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing  different kinds of politics  and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently    absolutely vital. CA  And if someone could convince you that we actually can make the    what was it     the     fold improvement in efficiency  of reduction of carbon footprint  would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge based goods  TJ  I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century  in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere  and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water. If you can convince me we can do all that  then  yes  I would take the two percent. CA  Tim  thank you for a very important talk. Thank you. I've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty  form and function of giant bluefin tuna. Bluefin are warmblooded like us. They're the largest of the tunas  the second largest fish in the sea    bony fish. They actually are a fish that is endothermic    powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal. That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming. It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins  gets lift  powers its movements with a lunate tail. It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body  so it reduces friction with the water. This is what one of nature's finest machines. Now  bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history. For       years  we fished sustainably for this animal  and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago. Bluefin are in cave paintings in France. They're on coins that date back       years. This fish was revered by humankind. It was fished sustainably till all of time  except for our generation. Bluefin are pursued wherever they go    there is a gold rush on Earth  and this is a gold rush for bluefin. There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. And yet  the type of fishing going on today  with pens  with enormous stakes  is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet. Now bluefin  in general  goes to one place  Japan. Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin. They're delectable muscle  rich in fat    absolutely taste delicious. And that's their problem  we're eating them to death. Now in the Atlantic  the story is pretty simple. Bluefin have two populations  one large  one small. The North American population is fished at about       ton. The European population and North African    the Eastern bluefin tuna    is fished at tremendous levels         tons over the last decade almost every year. The result is whether you're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population  there's been tremendous decline on both sides  as much as    percent if you go back with your baseline to     . For that  bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers  to lions  to certain African elephants and to pandas. These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months. They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago  despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I. And if it's tunas you don't care about  perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks  sharks  marlin  albatross. These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries. The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna  and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey. I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed. This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room. It's the   st century  but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way. Technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely. And we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works. Most of us from the ship    even I    look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea. We don't know where the structure is. We can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain. We can't see the corridors  and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna  a leatherback and an albatross. We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot. The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea. It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf  the entire Pacific realm. It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it. And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU  getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays  an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome. So the story of our team  a dedicated team  is fish and chips. We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts  or the same parts that are in your computer  chips. We're putting them together in unusual ways  and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before. And for the first time  we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset. Now  I've been working with tunas for over    years. I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean  put it behind glass  and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display. When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning  we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean  one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by. We can see in their beauty of form and function  their ceaseless activity. They're flying through their space  ocean space. And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty. Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Here  for over    or    years  we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity. We'd been studying these fish  but first we had to learn how to husbandry them. What do they like to eat  What is it that they're happy with  We go in the tanks with the tuna    we touch their naked skin    it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful. And then  better yet  we've got our own version of tuna whisperers  our own Chuck Farwell  Alex Norton  who can take a big tuna and in one motion  put it into an envelope of water  so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea. Jeff and Jason there  are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill  a flume. And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan  but it's staying in place. We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption  its energy consumption. We're taking this data and building better models. And when I see that tuna    this is my favorite view    I begin to wonder  how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did  So take a look at that animal. That's the closest you'll probably ever get. Now  the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean. So in a program called Tag A Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada  from Corsica to Spain. We've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas. We've actually tagged       tunas. And I'm going to show you three clips  because I tagged       tunas. It's a very hard process  but it's a ballet. We bring the tuna out  we measure it. A team of fishers  captains  scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes. We put water over its gills  give it oxygen. And then with a lot of effort  after tagging  putting in the computer  making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment  we send this fish back into the sea. And when it goes  we're always happy. We see a flick of the tail. And from our data that gets collected  when that tag comes back  because a fisher returns it for a thousand dollar reward  we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now  on a backboned animal. Now sometimes the tunas are really large  such as this fish off Nantucket. But that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged. It takes a human effort  a team effort  to bring the fish in. In this case  what we're going to do is put a pop up satellite archival tag on the tuna. This tag rides on the tuna  senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish  detach  float to the surface and send back to Earth orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag  pressure data and temperature data. And so what we get then from the pop up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag. Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive. These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America. They are some of our finest instruments  our new technology in the ocean today. One community in general has given more to help us than any other community. And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina. There are two villages  Harris and Morehead City  every winter for over a decade  held a party called Tag A Giant  and together  fishers worked with us to tag     to     fish. In this case  we're actually going to measure the fish. We're going to do something that in recent years we've started  take a mucus sample. Watch how shiny the skin is  you can see my reflection there. And from that mucus  we can get gene profiles  we can get information on gender  checking the pop up tag one more time  and then it's out in the ocean. And this is my favorite. With the help of my former postdoc  Gareth Lawson  this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna. This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean. The warm is the Gulf Stream  the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine. That's where the tuna wants to go    it wants to forage on schools of herring    but it can't get there. It's too cold. But then it warms up  and the tuna pops in  gets some fish  maybe comes back to home base  goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas. And my favorite scene  three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico. Three tunas tagged. Astronomically  we're calculating positions. They're coming together. That could be tuna sex    and there it is. That is where the tuna spawn. So from data like this  we're able now to put the map up  and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging. And now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side. So two populations of tunas    that is  we have a Gulf population  one that we can tag    they go to the Gulf of Mexico  I showed you that    and a second population. Living amongst our tunas    our North American tunas    are European tunas that go back to the Med. On the hot spots    the hope spots    they're mixed populations. And so what we've done with the science is we're showing the International Commission  building new models  showing them that a two stock no mixing model    to this day  used to reject the CITES treaty    that model isn't the right model. This model  a model of overlap  is the way to move forward. So we can then predict where management places should be. Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species  the single population  can be captured. These become forthright in places we need to protect. The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is  I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish  because they manage their fisheries well  they're doing a good job. But in the international realm  where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild  these are the places that we have to make hope spots in. That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna. Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics  we took on the planet as a team  those of us in the Census of Marine Life. And  funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others  we were able to actually go in  in our project    we're one of    field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators  not just tunas. So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska  met salmon shark on their home territory  followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that  if we take a salmon and put it on a line  we can actually take up a salmon shark    This is the cousin of the white shark    and very carefully    note  I say  very carefully      we can actually keep it calm  put a hose in its mouth  keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag. That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message. And that shark leaping there  if you look carefully  has an antenna. It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon  sending home its data. Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag. But there goes salmon sharks with this meter level resolution on an ocean of temperature    warm colors are warmer. Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey. Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson    there    and Sal Jorgensen. They can throw out a target    it's a carpet shaped like a seal    and in will come a white shark  a curious critter that will come right up to our    ft. boat. It's a several thousand pound animal. And we'll wind in the target. And we'll place an acoustic tag that says   OMSHARK         or something like that  acoustically with a ping. And then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long distance journeys with the light based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish. So in this case  Sal's looking at two tags there  and there they are  the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back. We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues  blue sharks. And now  together  what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature  we can see ten day worms of makos and salmon sharks. We have white sharks and blue sharks. For the first time  an ecoscape as large as ocean scale  showing where the sharks go. The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable  three teams tagged       tunas  bluefin  yellowfin and albacore all at the same time    carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out  pick up juvenile tunas  put in the tags that actually have the sensors  stick out the tuna and then let them go. They get returned  and when they get returned  here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor  returning to the Western Pacific. Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads  that come off when they slough. These elephant seals cover half an ocean  take data down to       feet    amazing data. And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags  light based tags  that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back  journeys of        nautical miles we had never seen before. But now with light based geolocation tags that are very small  we can actually see these journeys. Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes  up to the same zone the tunas use. You can see why they might be caught. Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are. And Scott Benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey. So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are. We can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean. And from this information  we can begin to map the hope spots. So this is just three years of data right here    and there's a decade of this data. We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on. So what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots        deployments  a huge herculean task        tags in an area  shown here for the first time  off the California coast  that appears to be a gathering place. And then for sort of an encore from these animals  they're helping us. They're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to       meters. They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles. Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles. This data  when visualized  is captivating to watch. We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data. And then  as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues  we also think it's critical to get this information to the public  to engage the public with this kind of data. We did this with the Great Turtle Race    tagged turtles  brought in four million hits. And now with Google's Oceans  we can actually put a white shark in that ocean. And when we do and it swims  we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii. But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see. We've got the capacity  NASA has the ocean. We just need to put it together. So in conclusion  we know where Yellowstone is for North America  it's off our coast. We have the technology that's shown us where it is. What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity. How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere  And then finally    to basically get the message home    maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks. Make killer apps  if you will. A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone. That way we do away with a few internet myths. So we can save the bluefin tuna. We can save the white shark. We have the science and technology. Hope is here. Yes we can. We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans. Thank you. We are here today because  the  United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries. They're called Millennium Development Goals. And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them. And by specifying eight different goals  the United Nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people. Look here    you have to end poverty  education  gender  child and maternal health  control infections  protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade. There's a second reason I like these development goals  and that is because each and every one is measured. Take child mortality  the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two thirds  from      to     . That's a four percent reduction per year    and this  with measuring. That's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing  a better life for people. And what I'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia  in the Middle East  in Latin America and East Europe that  are  reducing with this rate. And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year  and Turkey with seven percent per year. So there's good news. But then I hear people saying   There is no progress in Africa. And there's not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening.  I'll prove them wrong on both points. Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics. I bring you to the webpage  ChildMortality.org  where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries    it's done by U.N. specialists. And I will take Kenya as an example. Here you see the data. Don't panic    don't panic now  I'll help you through this. It looks nasty  like in college when you didn't like statistics. But first thing  when you see dots like this  you have to ask yourself  from where do the data come  What is the origin of the data  Is it so that in Kenya  there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it's sent to the statistical office  No    low income countries like Kenya still don't have that level of organization. It exists  but it's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family  and it's not registered. What we rely on is not an incomplete system. We have interviews  we have surveys. And this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about  her  birth history. How many children did you have  Are they alive  If they died  at what age and what year  And then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report. But these surveys are costly  so they can only be done  in  three  to five year intervals. But they have good quality. So this is a limitation. And all these colored lines here are results  each color is one survey. But that's too complicated for today  so I'll simplify it for you  and I give you one average point for each survey. This was                   '   and     . And when the experts in the U.N. have got these surveys in place in their database  then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line  and the trend line looks like this. See here    it's the best fit they can get of this point. But watch out    they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing. And they estimated that in       Kenya had per child mortality of    . And I was sad  because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the   s. It was so tragic. But in June  I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys  and it showed good news from Kenya. I was so happy. This was the estimate of the new survey. Then it just took another three months for  the  U.N. to get it into their server  and on Friday we got the new trend line    it was down here. Isn't it nice    isn't it nice  yeah  I was actually  on Friday  sitting in front of my computer  and I saw the death rate fall from     to    just that morning. So we celebrated. But now  when you have this trend line  how do we measure progress  I'm going into some details here  because  the  U.N. do it like this. They start  in          they measure to     . They say    .  percent  no progress.  That's unfair. As a professor  I think I have the right to propose something differently. I would say  at least do this       years is enough to follow the trend. It's two surveys  and you can see what's happening now. They have  .  percent. Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya  I may have joined these two points. So what I'm telling you is that we know the child mortality. We have a decent trend. It's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs. And the reason here for Africa is especially important  because '  s was a bad decade  not only in Kenya  but across Africa. The HIV epidemic peaked. There was resistance for the old malaria drugs  until we got the new drugs. We got  later  the mosquito netting. And there was socio economic problems  which are now being solved at a much better scale. So look at the average here    this is the average for all of sub Saharan Africa. And  the  U.N. says it's a reduction with  .  percent. Now this sounds a little theoretical  but it's not so theoretical. You know  these economists  they love money  they want more and more of it  they want it to grow. So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of  the  economy. We in public health  we hate child death  so we want less and less and less of child deaths. So we calculate the percent reduction per year  but it's sort of the same percentage. If your economy grows with four percent  you ought to reduce child mortality four percent  if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it. So is this fair now to measure this over    years  An economist would never do that. I have just divided it into two periods. In the   s  only  .  percent  only  .  percent. Whereas now  second gear    it's like Africa had first gear  now they go into second gear. But even this is not a fair representation of Africa  because it's an average  it's an average speed of reduction in Africa. And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs. Still here  child death per       on that axis. Here we have  the  year. And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG. I start    years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries. I give you Congo  which was high  Ghana    lower. And Kenya    even lower. And what has happened over the years since then  Here we go. You can see  with independence  literacy improved and vaccinations started  smallpox was eradicated  hygiene was improved  and things got better. But then  in the '  s  watch out here. Congo got into civil war  and they leveled off here. Ghana got very ahead  fast. This was the backlash in Kenya  and Ghana bypassed  but then Kenya and Ghana go down together    still a standstill in Congo. That's where we are today. You can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement. Time has come to stop thinking about sub Saharan Africa as one place. Their countries are so different  and they merit to be recognized in the same way  as we don't talk about Europe as one place. I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different    everyone knows that. And they are judged  each country  on how they are doing. So let me show the wider picture. My country  Sweden        we were up there. What a strange personality disorder we must have  counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate. It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing. But we had that habit in Sweden  you know  that we counted all the child deaths  even if we didn't do anything about it. And then  you see  these were famine years. These were bad years  and people got fed up with Sweden. My ancestors moved to the United States. And eventually  soon they started to get better and better here. And here we got better education  and we got health service  and child mortality came down. We never had a war  Sweden was in peace all this time. But look  the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast. Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early. We had primary school actually started in     . And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later. You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long term investments. It's not about just five years    it's long term investments. And Sweden never reached  the  Millennium Development Goal rate   .  percent when I calculated. So we are off track    that's what Sweden is. But you don't talk about it so much. We want others to be better than we were  and indeed  others have been better. Let me show you Thailand  see what a success story  Thailand from the     s    how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden. And I'll give you another story    Egypt  the most hidden  glorious success in public health. Egypt was up here in       higher than Congo. The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems. And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes  they increased education and they got primary health care. And down they went  you know. And they got safer water  they eradicated malaria. And isn't it a success story. Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible. And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest. Kenya is now speeding up. Here we have a problem. We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. Now  let me now bring you to a wider picture  a wider picture of child mortality. I'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here    this axis here is child mortality    and here I have the family size. The relationship between child mortality and family size. One  two  three  four children per woman  six  seven  eight children per woman. This is  once again             years ago. Each bubble is a country    the color  you can see  a continent. The dark blue here is sub Saharan Africa. And the size of the bubble is the population. And these are the so called  developing  countries. They had high  or very high  child mortality and family size  six to eight. And the ones over there  they were so called Western countries. They had low child mortality and small families. What has happened  What I want you  to do  now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size. I just want not to have any room for doubt    you have to see that for yourself. This is what happened. Now I start the world. Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox  better education  health service. It got down there    China comes into the Western box here. And here Brazil is in the Western Box. India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box  and we get a lot a new neighbors. Welcome to a decent life. Come on. We want everyone down there. This is the vision we have  isn't it. And look now  the first African countries here are coming in. There we are today. There is no such thing as a  Western world  and  developing world.  This is the report from  the  U.N.  which came out on Friday. It's very good     Levels and Trends in Child Mortality     except this page. This page is very bad  it's a categorization of countries. It labels  developing countries      I can read from the list here    developing countries  Republic of Korea    South Korea. Huh  They get Samsung  how can they be  a  developing country  They have here Singapore. They have the lowest child mortality in the world  Singapore. They bypassed Sweden five years ago  and they are labeled a developing country. They have here Qatar. It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera. How the heck could they be  a  developing country  This is crap. The rest here is good    the rest is good. We have to have a modern concept  which fits to the data. And we have to realize that we are all going to into this  down to here. What is the importance now with the relations here. Look    even if we look in Africa    these are the African countries. You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size  even within Africa. It's very clear that this is what happens. And a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle showing that almost    percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education. That is  when we get girls in school  we'll get an impact    to    years later  which is a secular trend which is very strong. That's why we must have that long term perspective  but we must measure the impact over    year periods. It's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together. And of course  lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects. It's a decent life for children  we are talking about. But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind  because it's about the environment. We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don't stabilize the world population. Let's be clear about that. And the way to do that  that is to get child mortality down  get access to family planning and behind that drive female education. And that is fully possible. Let's do it. Thank you very much. Imagine  if you will    a gift. I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. It's not too big    about the size of a golf ball. So envision what it looks like all wrapped up. But before I show you what's inside  I will tell you  it's going to do incredible things for you. It will bring all of your family together. You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years. Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you. It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy. You'll expand your vocabulary  meet new people  and you'll have a healthier lifestyle. And get this    you'll have an eight week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. You'll eat countless gourmet meals. Flowers will arrive by the truckload. People will say to you   You look great. Have you had any work done   And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs. You'll be challenged  inspired  motivated and humbled. Your life will have new meaning. Peace  health  serenity  happiness  nirvana. The price           and that's an incredible deal. By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one. Does Amazon carry it  Does it have the Apple logo on it  Is there a waiting list  Not likely. This gift came to me about five months ago. It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up    not quite so pretty. And this  and then this. It was a rare gem    a brain tumor  hemangioblastoma    the gift that keeps on giving. And while I'm okay now  I wouldn't wish this gift for you. I'm not sure you'd want it. But I wouldn't change my experience. It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected  unwanted and uncertain  consider that it just may be a gift. Sometimes I go browsing  through  a very old magazine. I found this observation test about the story of the ark. And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors  had some mistakes    there are more or less    mistakes. Some of them are very easy. There is a funnel  an aerial part  a lamp and clockwork key on the ark. Some of them are about the animals  the number. But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here. And this problem is  where are the plants  So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period  and no one is taking care of plants. Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird  of every kind of animal  of every kind of creature that moves  but no mention about plants. Why  In another part of the same story  all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark  so birds  livestock and wild animals. Plants are not living creatures    this is the point. That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible  but it's something that really accompanied humanity. Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book. Here we have the description of the order of nature. It's a nice description because it's starting from left    you have the stones    immediately after the stones  the plants that are just able to live. We have the animals that are able to live and to sense  and on the top of the pyramid  there is the man. This is not the common man. The  Homo studiosus     the studying man. This is quite comforting for people like me    I'm a professor    this to be over there on the top of creation. But it's something completely wrong. You know very well about professors. But it's also wrong about plants  because plants are not just able to live  they are able to sense. They are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals. Just to give you an example  every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least    different chemical and physical parameters. And they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence. Well  but this is something    this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us. Let's have a look at this short movie now. We have David Attenborough. Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover  he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior. Now  when he speaks about plants  everything is correct. When he speaks about animals   he  tends to remove the fact that plants exist. The blue whale  the biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is wrong  completely wrong. The blue whale  it's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet    that is  this wonderful  magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum. And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least       tons. Now  the story that plants are some low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by Aristotle  that in  De Anima     that is a very influential book for the Western civilization    wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living. They have just a kind of very low level soul. It's called the vegetative soul  because they lack movement  and so they don't need to sense. Let's see. Okay  some of the movements of the plants are very well known. This is a very fast movement. This is a Dionaea  a Venus fly trap hunting snails    sorry for the snail. This has been something that has been refused for centuries  despite the evidence. No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal  because it was against the order of nature. But plants are also able to show a lot of movement. Some of them are very well known  like the flowering. It's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse. Some of them are much more sophisticated. Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time. And it's really so graceful  it's like a dancing angel. They are also able to play    they are really playing. These are young sunflowers  and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing. They are training themselves  as many young animals do  to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day. They are able to respond to gravity  of course  so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity. But they are also able to sleep. This is one  Mimosa pudica. So during the night  they curl the leaves and reduce the movement  and during the day  you have the opening of the leaves    there is much more movement. This is interesting because this sleeping machinery  it's perfectly conserved. It's the same in plants  in insects and in animals. And so if you need to study this sleeping problem  it's easy to study on plants  for example  than in animals and it's much more easy even ethically. It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation. Plants are even able to communicate    they are extraordinary communicators. They communicate with other plants. They are able to distinguish kin and non kin. They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles  for example  during the pollination. Now with the pollination  it's a very serious issue for plants  because they move the pollen from one flower to the other  yet they cannot move from one flower to the other. So they need a vector    and this vector  it's normally an animal. Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination  but not just insects  even birds  reptiles  and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen. This is a serious business. We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance    very energizing    having in change this transportation of the pollen. But some plants are manipulating animals  like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen. Now  there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen. How is it possible to do this without a brain  We need to wait until       when this big man  Charles Darwin  publishes a wonderful  astonishing book that starts a revolution. The title is  The Power of Movement in Plants.  No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin. In his book  assisted by his son  Francis    who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world  in Cambridge    they took into consideration every single movement for     pages. And in the last paragraph of the book  it's a kind of stylistic mark  because normally Charles Darwin stored  in the last paragraph of a book  the most important message. He wrote that   It's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals.  This is not a metaphor. He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.D. Hooker  or at that time  president of the Royal Society  so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants. Now  this is a root apex growing against a slope. So you can recognize this kind of movement  the same movement that worms  snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display. And it's not an easy movement because  to have this kind of movement  you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain. So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here  depicted in blue    that is called the  transition zone.  And this region  it's a very small region    it's less than one millimeter. And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important  you have these kinds of signals here. The signals that you are seeing here are action potential  are the same signals that the neurons of my brain  of our brain  use to exchange information. Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature  but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant  like a plant of rye. We have almost    million roots. We have    and a half million root apex and a total length of     or more kilometers and a very high surface area. Now let's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others. Here were have on the left  the Internet and on the right  the root apparatus. They work in the same way. They are a network of small computing machines  working in networks. And why are they so similar  Because they evolved for the same reason  to survive predation. They work in the same way. So you can remove    percent of the root apparatus and the plants  continue  to work. You can remove    percent of the Internet and it is  continuing  to work. So  a suggestion for the people working with networks  plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks. And another possibility is a technological possibility. Let's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants. Until now  the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot. We have the animaloid    and the normal robots inspired by animals  insectoid  so on. We have the androids that are inspired by man. But why have we not any plantoid  Well  if you want to fly  it's good that you look at birds    to be inspired by birds. But if you want to explore soils  or if you want to colonize new territory  to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this. We have another possibility we are working  on  in our lab   which  is to build hybrids. It's much more easy to build hybrids. Hybrid means it's something that's half living and half machine. It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals. They have computing power  they have electrical signals. The connection with the machine is much more easy  much more even ethically possible. And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids  driven by algae or by the leaves at the end  by the most  most powerful parts of the plants  by the roots. Well  thank you for your attention. And before I finish  I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation. Thank you. One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world  and I do that quite regularly. And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places  I'm really struck by the things that we have in common. They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful  to be healthy  and to have a successful life. But I also see lots of poverty  and it's quite jarring  both in the scale and the scope of it. My first trip in India  I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors  no running water  no electricity  and that's really what I see all over the world. So in short  I'm startled by all the things that they don't have. But I am surprised by one thing that they do have  Coca Cola. Coke is everywhere. In fact  when I travel to the developing world  Coke feels ubiquitous. And so when I come back from these trips  and I'm thinking about development  and I'm flying home and I'm thinking   We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations   you know  Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder  how is it that they can get Coke to these far flung places  If they can do that  why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing  And I'm not the first person to ask this question. But I think  as a community  we still have a lot to learn. It's staggering  if you think about Coca Cola. They sell  .  billion servings every single day. That's like every man  woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week. So why does this matter  Well  if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world  we need to learn from the innovators  and those innovators come from every single sector. I feel that  if we can understand what makes something like Coca Cola ubiquitous  we can apply those lessons then for the public good. Coke's success is relevant  because if we can analyze it  learn from it  then we can save lives. So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke. And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca Cola. They take real time data and immediately feed it back into the product. They tap into local entrepreneurial talent  and they do incredible marketing. So let's start with the data. Now Coke has a very clear bottom line    they report to a set of shareholders  they have to turn a profit. So they take the data  and they use it to measure progress. They have this very continuous feedback loop. They learn something  they put it back into the product  they put it back into the market. They have a whole team called  Knowledge and Insight.  It's a lot like other consumer companies. So if you're running Namibia for Coca Cola  and you have a     constituencies  you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite  Fanta or Coke was sold  whether it was a corner store  a supermarket or a pushcart. So if sales start to drop  then the person can identify the problem and address the issue. Let's contrast that for a minute to development. In development  the evaluation comes at the very end of the project. I've sat in a lot of those meetings  and by then  it is way too late to use the data. I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark. They said   You roll the ball  you hear some pins go down. It's dark  you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on  and then you an see your impact.  Real time data turns on the lights. So what's the second thing that Coke's good at  They're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent. Coke's been in Africa since       but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets  because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world  which was a large truck rolling down the street. And in Africa  the remote places  it's hard to find a good road. But Coke noticed something    they noticed that local people were taking the product  buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard to reach places. And so they took a bit of time to learn about that. And they decided in      that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs  giving them small loans. They set them up as what they called micro distribution centers  and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people  who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product. There are now some       of these centers employing about        people in Africa. In Tanzania and Uganda  they represent    percent of Coke's sales. Let's look at the development side. What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke  Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well  because the locals know how to reach the very hard to serve places  their neighbors  and they know what motivates them to make change. I think a great example of this is Ethiopia's new health extension program. The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic  they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic. So if you're in an emergency situation    or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby    forget it  to get to the health care center. They decided that wasn't good enough  so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this  and they adapted it for Ethiopia. And in       the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country. They trained        health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people. In just five years  their ratio went from one worker for every        people to one worker for every       people. Now  think about how this can change people's lives. Health extension workers can help with so many things  whether it's family planning  prenatal care  immunizations for the children  or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on time delivery. That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia  and it's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down    percent from      to     . In Ethiopia  there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program. So what's the next step for Ethiopia  Well  they're already starting talk about this. They're starting to talk about   How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas  How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting out in those remote villages   That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people's potential. The third component of Coke's success is marketing. Ultimately  Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca Cola. Now the reason these micro entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow. So  they rely on Coca Cola in terms of its marketing  and what's the secret to their marketing  Well  it's aspirational. It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live. So even though it's a global company  they take a very local approach. Coke's global campaign slogan is  Open Happiness.  But they localize it. And they don't just guess what makes people happy  they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life. And in South Africa  they associate happiness with seriti or community respect. Now  that played itself out in the World Cup campaign. Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it   Wavin' Flag  by a Somali hip hop artist.   Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh     Oh oh oh oh oh o oh     Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o oh    Give you freedom  give you fire    Give you reason  take you higher     See the champions take the field now     You define us  make us feel proud     In the streets our heads are lifted     As we lose our inhibition     Celebration  it's around us     Every nation  all around us   Melinda French Gates  It feels pretty good  right  Well  they didn't stop there    they localized it into    different languages. And it went number one on the pop chart in    countries. It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood   I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing   that also went number one on the pop charts. Both songs have something in common  that same appeal of celebration and unity. So how does health and development market  Well  it's based on avoidance  not aspirations. I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.  Use a condom  don't get AIDS.   Wash you hands  you might not get diarrhea.  It doesn't sound anything like  Wavin' Flag  to me. And I think we make a fundamental mistake    we make an assumption  that we think that  if people need something  we don't have to make them want that. And I think that's a mistake. And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change. One example is sanitation. We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation. But there's a solution  you build a toilet. But what we're finding around the world  over and over again  is  if you build a toilet and you leave it there  it doesn't get used. People reuse it for a slab for their home. They sometimes store grain in it. I've even seen it used for a chicken coop. But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea  Well  you work with the community. You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn't be done in the village  and they agree to that. But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern  trendy convenience. One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship. And it works    look at these headlines. I'm not kidding. Women are refusing to marry men without toilets. No loo  no  I do.  Now  it's not just a funny headline    it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign. But more importantly  it saves lives. Take a look at this    this is a room full of young men and my husband  Bill. And can you guess what the young men are waiting for  They're waiting to be circumcised. Can you you believe that  We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by    percent in men. And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation  I have to admit  Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying   But who's going to volunteer for this procedure   But it turns out the men do  because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it  and the men also believe it improves their sex life. So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development  we can change communities and we can change whole nations. Well  why is all of this so important  So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together  when you tie the three things together. And polio  I think  is one of the most powerful examples. We've seen a    percent reduction in polio in    years. So if you look back to       there are about         cases of polio on the planet that year. In       we're down to       cases. Well how did that happen  Let's look at a country like India. They have over a billion people in this country  but they have        local doctors who report paralysis  and clinicians  a huge reporting system in chemists. They have two and a half million vaccinators. But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you. Let me tell you the story of Shriram  an    month boy in Bihar  a northern state in India. This year on August  th  he felt paralysis and on the   th  his parents took him to the doctor. On August   th and   th  they took a stool sample  and by the   th of August  it was confirmed he had Type   polio. By August   th  a genetic test was done  and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had. Now it could have come from one of two places. It could have come from Nepal  just to the north  across the border  or from Jharkhand  a state just to the south. Luckily  the genetic testing proved that  in fact  this strand came north  because  had it come from the south  it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission. So many more people would have been affected. So what's the endgame  Well on September  th  there was a huge mop up campaign  which is what you do in polio. They went out and where Shriram lives  they vaccinated two million people. So in less than a month  we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program. And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio. That's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading  and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands  they can save lives. Now one of the challenges in polio  still  is marketing  but it might not be what you think. It's not the marketing on the ground. It's not telling the parents   If you see paralysis  take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated.  We have a problem with marketing in the donor community. The G  nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last    years  but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer. So by next summer  we're sighted to run out of money on polio. So we are    percent of the way there on this goal and we're about to run short of money. And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational  if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease  we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us. And if we could do that  we could stop vaccinating everybody  worldwide  in all of our countries for polio. And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet. And we are so close. And this victory is so possible. So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness  I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms. To me  that is deep happiness. And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector  then in the future we make together  that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca Cola. Thank you. I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype. My wife sent me a message   Whoa  earthquake   and then disappeared for    minutes. It was    minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U.S. felt. I was afraid of a tsunami  what I didn't realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti  and that was building collapse. We've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti. These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake  while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country. This is the national palace    the equivalent of the White House. This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time. This is a nurses' college    there are     nurses studying. The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed. This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance. We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti  but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost. We haven't heard about why the buildings failed. After all  it was the buildings  not the earthquake  that killed         people  that injured          that displaced  .  million people  that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation. This is the largest metropolitan area disaster in decades  and it was not a natural disaster    it was a disaster of engineering. AIDG has worked in Haiti since       providing engineering and business support to small businesses. And after the quake  we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed  to examine what was safe and what wasn't. Working with MINUSTAH  which is the U.N. mission in Haiti  with the Ministry of Public Works  with different NGOs  we inspected over       buildings. We inspected schools and private residencies. We inspected medical centers and food warehouses. We inspected government buildings. This is the Ministry of Justice. Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives. The fellow in the door  Andre Filitrault    who's the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo    was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives. Andre told me  after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way  that there is no new research here. There is nothing here that we don't know. The failure points were the same  walls and slabs not tied properly into columns    that's a roof slab hanging off the building    cantilevered structures  or structures that were asymmetric  that shook violently and came down  poor building materials  not enough concrete  not enough compression in the blocks  rebar that was smooth  rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away. Now there's a solution to all these problems. And we know how to build properly. The proof of this came in Chile  almost a month later  when  .  magnitude earthquake hit Chile. That is     times the power of the  .  that hit Port au Prince        times the power  yet only under a thousand casualties. Adjusted for population density  that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake. What was the difference between Chile and Haiti  Seismic standards and confined masonry  where the building acts as a whole    walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other    instead of breaking off into separate members and failing. If you look at this building in Chile  it's ripped in half  but it's not a pile of rubble. Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades. Right now  AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers  Architecture for Humanity  to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti. This is Xantus Daniel  he's a mason  just a general construction worker  not a foreman  who took one of our trainings. On his last job he was working with his boss  and they started pouring the columns wrong. He took his boss aside  and he showed him the materials on confined masonry. He showed him   You know  we don't have to do this wrong. It won't cost us any more to do it the right way.  And they redid that building. They tied the rebar right  they poured the columns right  and that building will be safe. And every building that they build going forward will be safe. To make sure these buildings are safe  it's not going to take policy    it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques. Now there are many groups doing this. And the fellow in the vest there  Craig Toten  he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this. Through Haiti Rewired  through Build Change  Architecture for Humanity  AIDG  there is the possibility to reach out to                  masons across the country and create a movement of proper building. If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it's extremely affordable. For the billions spent on reconstruction  you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime. Ultimately  there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti  the way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades. The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail. The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building  where the walls are tied together  the building is symmetric  and it will stand up to an earthquake. For all the disaster  there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation  so that when the next earthquake hits  it is a disaster    but not a tragedy. I was informed by this kind of unoriginal and trite idea that new technologies were an opportunity for social transformation  which is what drove me then  and still  it's a delusion that drives me now. I wanted to update what I've been doing since then    but it's still the same theme song    and introduce you to my lab and current work  which is the Environmental Health Clinic that I run at NYU. And what it is    it's a twist on health. Because  really  what I'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health. It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university  except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns  and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health  as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals. It's a handy dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath that says   The greater part of the soul lays outside the body  treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer.  But that suggests the issue that I'm trying to get at here  that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health. Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error. And I would use this study  a recent study by Philip Landrigan  to motivate a different view of health  where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan and the New York area and logged what they spent their patient hours on.    to    percent of their time was spent on five things. Number one was asthma  number two was developmental delays  number three was     fold increases in rare childhood cancers in the last eight to        years. Number four and five were childhood obesity and diabetes related issues. So all of those    what's common about all of those  The environment is implicated  radically implicated  right. This is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with  this is a different definition of health  health that has a great advantage because it's external  it's shared  we can do something about it  as opposed to internal  genetically predetermined or individualized. People who come to the clinic are called  not patients  but impatients  because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues. And I meet them at the University  I also have a few field offices that I set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face. I like this one from the Belgian field office  where we met in a roundabout  precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation  as opposed to the top down control of red light traffic intersections. In this case  of course  the roundabout with that micro decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do. But  of course  affords greater throughput  fewer accidents  and an interesting model of social movement. Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed  this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol  or keeping tabs  if you will. What they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality. So an impatient concerned for water quality would raise a tadpole bureaucrat in a sample of water in which they're interested. And we give them a couple of things to do that  to help them do companion animal devices while they're blogging and doing their email. This is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening. And the interesting thing that happens    because we're using tadpoles  of course  because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have  several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for sensing  responding in a biologically meaningful way  to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone emulators. But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening    there's a few action shots    your neighbors are likely to say   What are you doing   And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after. You have to explain what you're doing and how the developmental events of a tadpole are  of course  very observable and they use the same T  mediated hormones that we do. And so next time your neighbor sees you they'll say   How is that tadpole doing   And you can let them social network with your tadpole  because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site for  not only impatients  humans  but non humans  social networking for humans and non humans. And of course  these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic  the obesity epidemic  the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things. The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole  observing the behavioral and developmental events  you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you've seen. Another quick protocol    and I'm going to go through these quickly  but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here    instead of asking you for urine samples  I'll ask you for a mouse sample. Anyone here lucky enough to share  to cohabit with a mouse    a domestic partnership with mice  Very lucky. Mice  of course  are the quintessential model organism. They're even better models of environmental health  because not only the same mammalian biology  but they share your diet  largely. They share your environmental stressors  the asbestos levels and lead levels  whatever you're exposed to. And they're geographically more limited than you are  because we don't know if you've been exposed to persistent organic pollutants in your home  or occupationally or as a child. Mice are a very good representation. So it starts by building a better mousetrap  of course. This is one of them. Coping with environmental stressors is tricky. Is anybody here on antidepressants  There's a lot of people in Manhattan are. And we were testing if the mice would also self administer SSRIs. So this was Prozac  this was Zoloft  this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant  all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking. So do you think the mice self administered antidepressants  What's the     Audience  Sure. Yes.  How did you know that  They did. This was vodka and solution  gin and solution. This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant. Where's our expert  Vodka  gin    Yes. Yes. You know your mice well. They did  yes. So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water  which was interesting. Then of course  it goes into the entrapment device. There's an old cellphone in there    a good use for old cellphones    which dials the clinic  we go and pick up the mouse. We take the blood sample and do the blood work and hair work on the mice. And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way. But we do have a few prescription products through this. It's very different from the medical model. Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality  or to understand it or to change it  the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with. And that aggregating effect  that collective action effect  is actually something we can use to our advantage. So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic called the No Park. This is a prescription to improve water quality. Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality. What we do is we take a fire hydrant  a  no parking  space associated with a fire hydrant  and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape  to create an infiltration opportunity. Because  many of you will know  that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the New York  New Jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources  no longer the big polluters  no longer the GEs  but that massive network of roads   those  impervious surfaces  that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system. That doesn't do a lot of good. These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants before they enter the harbor  and they're produced by impatients on various city blocks in some very interesting ways. I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though  there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block. By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them  we don't prevent them from being used as emergency vehicle parking spaces  because  of course  a firetruck can come and park there. They flatten a few plants. No big deal  they'll regenerate. But if we did this in every single    every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency. That    percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there  it's infiltrating pollutants. It's also increasing fixing CO s  sequestering some of the airborne pollutants. And aggregated  these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system  up to a seven inch rain event  up to a hundred year storm. So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health. This is one of the more ambitious ones. What the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secondary  more insidious and more pervasive crisis  which is the crisis of agency  which is what to do. Somehow buying a local lettuce  changing a light bulb  driving the speed limit  changing your tires regularly  doesn't seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis. And this is an interesting icon that happened    you remember these  fallout shelters. What is the fallout shelter for the climate crisis  This was civic mobilization. Churches  school groups  hospitals  private residents    everyone built one of these in a matter of months. And they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared  uncertain  collective threat. Fallout shelter for the climate crisis  I would say  looks something like this  or this  which is an intensive urban agriculture facility that's due to go on my lab building at NYU. What it does is a very simple idea of taking       to    percent of the CO  produced in Manhattan is building related    we take  just like a commercial greenhouse  we take the CO  from the building    CO  enriched air    we force it through the urban agriculture facility  and then we resupply oxygen enriched air. You can't actually build much on a roof  they're not designed for that. So it's on legs  so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns. It's built as a barn raising  using open source hardware. This is the quarter scale prototype that was functioning in Spain. This is what it will look like  fingers crossed  NYU willing. And what I want to show you is    actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing    which is a solar chimney    we have got    of them now put around New York at the moment    that passively draws air up. You understand a solar chimney. Hot air rises. You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building  it'll heat up  and you'll get passive airflow. What we do is actually put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that. That actually removes about    percent of the carbon black  that stuff that  with ozone  is responsible for about half of global warming's effects  because it changes  it settles on the snow  it changes the reflectors  it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere. Carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs  and it's associated with. It's not good stuff  and it's from inefficient combustion  not from combustion itself. When we put it through our solar chimney  we remove actually about    percent of that. And then I swap it out with the students and actually re release that carbon black. And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime that we've pulled out of the air. Here's one of them that we have up now. Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users. Okay  so I want to show you just two more interfaces  because I think one of our big challenges is re imagining our relationship to natural systems  not only through this model of twisted personalized health  but through the animals with whom we cohabit. We are not alone  the animals are moving in. In fact  urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers. You know  coyote in Central Park  a whale in the Gowanus Canal  elk in Westchester County. It's happening all over the Developed World  probably for loss of habitat  but also because our cities are a little bit more livable than they have been. And every green space we create is an invitation for non humans to cohabit with us. But we've kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly. And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ    which is zoo backwards and without cages    to try and reform that relationship. This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this. When a bird lands on it  they trigger a sound file. This is actually in the Whitney Museum  where there were six of them  each of which had a different argument on it  different sound file. They said things like this. Recorded Voice  Here's what you need to do. Go down there and buy some of those health food bars  the ones you call bird food  and bring it here and scatter it around. There's a good person. Natalie Jeremijenko  Okay.  Laugher  So there was several of these. The birds were able to jump from one to the other. These are just your average urban pigeon. And an early test which argument elicited cooperative behavior from the people below    about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us. Recorded Voice  Tick  tick  tick. That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu. Do you know what slows it down  Healthy sub populations of birds  increasing biodiversity generally. It is in your interests that I'm healthy  happy  well fed. Hence  you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them. That is  share your lunch. NJ  It worked  and it's true. The final project I'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched    it's actually officially launched next week    with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League. You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish  but there is now a device for you to do so. It looks like this  buoys that float on the water  project three foot up  three foot down. When a fish swims underneath  a light goes on. This is what it looks like. So there's another function on here. This top light is    I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick    this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red  when the dissolved oxygen is low  to a blue green  when its dissolved oxygen is high. And then you can also text the fish. So there's business cards down there that'll give you contact details. And they text back. When the buoys get your text  they wink at you twice to say  we've got your message. But perhaps the most popular has been that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River  where the first beaver    crazy as he is    to have moved in and built a lodge in New York in     years  hangs out. So updates from a beaver. You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him. And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re scripts how we interact with natural systems  specifically by changing who has information  where they have it  who can make sense of that information  and what you can do about it. In this case  instead of throwing chewing gum  or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish    There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city  and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution  it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds. Instead of doing that actually  we've developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish. They're delicious. They're cross species delicious that is  delicious for humans and non humans. But they also have a chelating agent in them. They're nutritionally appropriate  not like Doritos. And so every time that desire to interact with the animals  which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign   Do not feed the animals.  And there's about three of them on every New York City park. And Yellowstone National Park  there's more  do not feed the animals  signs than there are animals you might wish to feed. But in that action  that interaction  by re scripting that  by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate  that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent  which  like any chelating agent that we use medicinally  binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it's complexed by a reactive  effectively removing it from bioavailability. But I wanted to say that interaction  re scripting that interaction  into collective action  collective remediative action  very different from the approach that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River  where we're dredging the PCBs    after    years of legislative and legal struggle  GE's paying for the dredging of the largest Superfund site in the world    we're dredging it  and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania or the nearest Third World country  where it will continue to be toxic sludge. Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues. And that's typically the paradigm under which we've operated. By actually taking the opportunity that new technologies  new interactive technologies  present to re script our interactions  to script them  not just as isolated  individuated interactions  but as collective aggregating actions that can amount to something  we can really begin to address some of our important environmental challenges. Thank you. Every presentation needs this slide in it. It's beautiful  isn't it  Do you see  All the points  all the lines    it's incredible. It is the network  and in my case  the network has been important in media  because I get to connect to people. Isn't it amazing  Through that  I connect to people. And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted. For example  I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners. I put together projects like Earth Sandwich  where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth. And people started laying bread in tribute  and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain. It's pretty incredible    the video's online. Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example. In YoungmeNowme  the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult. This is the same person    top photo  James  bottom photo   Jennifer . Poignant. This was a Mother's Day gift. Particularly creepy. My favorite of these photos  which I couldn't find  is there's a picture of a    year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap  and the next photo is a     lb man with a tiny  little old lady peaking over his shoulder. But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people. This is project called Ray. And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio. Somebody said   You have to listen to this.  And this is what came to me. Recording  Hi  my name is Ray  and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair. Being quite disturbed  she called for comfort  and I didn't really know what to tell her  because we have to deal with so much mess in our society. So I was led to write this song just for her  just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job. And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job. Here's how the song goes.   I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  if you don't leave me alone      you gonna have to send me home     'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass   Now you might not be able to sing that out loud  but you can hum it to yourself  and you know what the words are. And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job. All right. Stay strong. Peace. Ze Frank  So    yeah. No  no  no  shush. We've got to go quickly. So I was so moved by this    this is incredible. This was connecting  right. This was  at a distance  realizing that someone was feeling something  wanting to affect them in a particular way  using media to do it  putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact. This was incredible  this is what I wanted to do. So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him. And I asked my audience  I said   Listen to this piece of audio. We have to remix it. He's got a great voice. It's actually in the key of B flat. And have to do something with it.  Hundreds of remixes came back    lots of different attempts. One stood out in particular. It was done by a guy named Goose. Remix    I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  I'm about to whip somebody's ass     Oh  if you don't leave me alone      You gonna have to send me home     Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass     I'm about to whip some      ZF  Great  so it was incredible. That song     Applause  Thank you. So that song  somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City. In the end  it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services. And so I said   Let's put this together in an album.  And the audience came together  and they designed an album cover. And I said   If you put it all on this  I'm going to deliver it to him  if you can figure out who this person is   because all I had was his name    Ray    and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset. In two weeks  they found him. I received and email and it said   Hi  I'm Ray. I heard you were looking for me.  And I was like   Yeah  Ray. It's been an interesting two weeks.  And so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray  and he's a preacher    among other things. So but anyways  here's the thing    is it reminds me of this  which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner. And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world. I look at this photo  and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button  but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street. And it makes me think of this. On street corners everywhere  people are looking at their cell phones  and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture. But the truth is life is being lived there. When they smile    right  you've seen people stop    all of a sudden  life is being lived there  somewhere up in that weird  dense network. And this is it  right  to feel and be felt. It's the fundamental force that we're all after. We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier  but ultimately  what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person. And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces. It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces  and we have to get better at figuring that out. I think  of the people that build all this technology in the network  a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people. This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade. So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection. Sometimes they're very  very simple things. A Childhood Walk  which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless    like on the route to the bus stop  to a neighbor's house  and take it inside of Google Streetview. And I promise you  if you take that walk inside Google Streetview  you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face. And I collected those moments    the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories  specifically.  Our conversation started with me saying  'I'm bored ' and her replying  'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.' I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot.   Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom  I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola.   They used some of the morbidly artist footage  a close up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway. I guess the shoes came off when he was hit. He slept over at my house once  and he left his pillow. It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it. He died long after he left the pillow at my house  but we never got around to returning it.  Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract. This is Pain Pack. Right after September   th  last year  I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it  the way that we excise it from our bodies. So what I did is I opened up a hotline    a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain  not necessarily related to that event. And people called in and left messages like this. Recording  Okay  here's something. I'm not alone  and I am loved. I'm really fortunate. But sometimes I feel really lonely. And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry. Like even people in convenience stores saying   Have a nice day   when they're accidentally looking me in the eye. ZF  So what I did was I took those voicemails  and with their permission  converted them to MP s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails. And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material. We don't have time to play much of it. You can look at it online.  From    to    with love  was a project around the time of the last election cycle  where McCain and Obama both  in their speeches after the election  talked about reconciliation  and I was like   What the hell does that look like   So I thought   Well let's just give it a try. Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation.  And so some really nice things came together.  I voted blue. I voted red. Together  for our future.  These are very  very cute little things right. Some came from the winning party.  Dear     I promise to listen to you  to fight for you  to respect you always.  Some came from the party who had just lost.  From a    to a     may your party's leadership be as classy as you  but I doubt it.  But the truth was that as this start becoming popular  a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing  which I could also see. And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail  death threats even. And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages  and he was dressed as Batman. And he said   I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity.  Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me  which actually made me feel a little better    like   Phew  it's not him.  So what I did    unfortunately  I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me  and it started to eat away at my psyche. And I was protecting the project from it  I realized. I was protecting it    I didn't want this special  little group of photographs to get sullied in some way. So what I did  I took all those emails  and I put them together into something called Angrigami  which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff. And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami. But this was the emotional moment. One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate. It's amazing. The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know  where the idea was  I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects. So one of them was fairly straightforward. A guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her  his daughter. And I said   Oh yeah  I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep.  And this was  Scared.    I don't know why but it helps me get over it     The words of the song just move me along     And somehow I get over it     At least I don't suck at life     I keep on trying despite     At least I don't suck at life     I keep on trying despite     This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something   Okay  so I wrote that song  right. Thank you. So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point  and she actually was singing that song to herself. So I was like   Awesome. This is great.  And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this. And I don't have much time. But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You  where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person. So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me. And I got a lot  like    in a half an hour. And I shut that part down. And I chose two people to be  and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook. One person sent me a very detailed description  the other person didn't. And the person who didn't  it turned out  had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job. So  you know  people were writing me and saying   How's your new job   I was like   I don't know. Didn't know I had one.  But anyway  this same person  Laura  ended up emailing me a little bit after that project. And I felt badly for not having done a good job. And she said   I'm really anxious  I just moved to a new town  I have this new job  and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety.  So she had seen the  Scared  song and wondered if I could do something. So I asked her   What does it feel like when you feel this way   And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety. And so what I decided to do. I said   Okay  I'll think about it.  And so quietly in the background  I started sending people this.   You're okay     You'll be fine   So I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities  just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on  so I could just get their voices back. And this is the kind of thing that I got back. Recording    Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine   ZF  So that's one of the better ones  really. But what's awesome is  as I started getting more and more and more of them  all of a sudden I had        voices from around the world. And when you put them together  something magical happens  something absolutely incredible happens  and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world. And what was really great is  I'm putting all this work together in the background  and Laura sent me a follow up email because a good month had passed by. And she said   I know you've forgotten about me. I just want to say thanks for even considering it.  And then a few days later I sent her this.   And things that looked so good yesterday     are now shades of gray     And it seems like the world is spinning     while I'm standing still     Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell     And then you say     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     And now the words sing     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Now everybody sings     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe     Hey     You're okay     You'll be fine     Just breathe   Thank you. The stories we tell about each other matter very much. The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter. And most of all  I think the way that we participate in each other's stories is of deep importance. I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor. Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves  I heard them from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus  kind of via my Sunday school teacher. I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material    food  clothing  shelter    that they didn't have. And I also was taught  coupled with that  that it was my job    this classroom full of five and six year old children    it was our job  apparently  to help. This is what Jesus asked of us. And then he said   What you do for the least of these  you do for me.  Now I was pretty psyched. I was very eager to be useful in the world    I think we all have that feeling. And also  it was kind of interesting that God needed help. That was news to me  and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in. But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said  and I'm paraphrasing  the poor would always be with us. This frustrated and confused me  I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do  and I was excited to do  but no matter what I would do  I would fail. So I felt confused  a little bit frustrated and angry  like maybe I'd misunderstood something here. And I felt overwhelmed. And for the first time  I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people. I imagined in my head  a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away  that would always be with us. They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things  which I was excited to do  but I didn't know how it was going to work. And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give  especially if the problem was never going away. In the years following  the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive. For example  I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering. I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor. I heard about disease  I heard about war    they always seemed to be kind of related. And in general  I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness  devastation  hopelessness. And after a while  I developed what I think many of us do  is this predictable response  where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them. I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth  because I wasn't doing more  apparently  to make things better. And I even felt a sense of shame because of that. And so naturally  I started to distance myself. I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before. And I stopped expecting things to really change. Now I still gave    on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved. I gave of my time and my money  I gave when solutions were on sale. The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life  right. I mean who can argue with that  I gave when I was cornered  when it was difficult to avoid and I gave  in general  when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering  not someone else's. The truth be told  I was giving out of that place  not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity. It became a transaction for me  became sort of a trade. I was purchasing something    I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news. And I think the way that we go through that sometimes can  first of all  disembody a group of people  individuals out there in the world. And it can also turn into a commodity  which is a very scary thing. So as I did this  and as I think many of us do this  we kind of buy our distance  we kind of buy our right to go on with our day. I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most. It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life and  in short to love. Thankfully  a few years ago  things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak  Dr. Muhammad Yunus. I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is  but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak  Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance. When I heard him speak  it was three years before that. But basically  microfinance    if this is new to you as well    think of that as financial services for the poor. Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day. Dr. Yunus shared his story  explaining what that was  and what he had done with his Grameen Bank. He also talked about  in particular  microlending  which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business. Now  when I heard him speak  it was exciting for a number of reasons. First and foremost  I learned about this new method of change in the world that  for once  showed me  maybe  a way to interact with someone and to give  to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird and didn't make me feel bad    that was exciting. But more importantly  he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before. In fact  those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note. He was talking about strong  smart  hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better. All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital. It was an amazing sort of insight for me. And I  in fact  was so deeply moved by this    it's hard to express now how much that affected me    but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later  and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about. For the first time  actually  in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals  I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs  and see for myself what their lives were actually about. So I spent three months in Kenya  Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received     dollars to start or grow a business. And in fact  through those interactions  for the first time  I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away. I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories. And over and over again  as I interviewed them and spent my days with them  I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change. So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats. Their business trajectory would change. They would make a little bit more money  their standard of living would shift and would get better. And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives  like they would start to send their children to school. They might be able to buy mosquito nets. Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure. Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud. But there were these beautiful details  even if I talked to    goat herders in a row  and some days that's what happened    these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them. That was another thing that really touched me. It was really humbling to see for the first time  to really understand that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything  I probably would have gotten a lot wrong. Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them. So I saw that and it was very humbling. Anyway  another interesting thing happened while I was there. I never once was asked for a donation  which had kind of been my mode  right. There's poverty  you give money to help    no one asked me for a donation. In fact  no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all. If anything  they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities. So what I did hear  once in a while  was that people wanted a loan    I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting. And by the way  I was a philosophy and poetry major in school  so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa. I just got this impression that the money would work. And my introduction to business was in these      little infuses of capital. And I learned about profit and revenue  about leverage  all sorts of things  from farmers  from seamstresses  from goat herders. So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family  and through that  maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans  that's this little idea that turned into Kiva. A few months later  I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner  Matthew  and I had kind of built  and took pictures of seven of my new friends  posted their stories  these stories of entrepreneurship  up on the website  spammed friends and family and said   We think this is legal. Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details  but do you say  do you want to help participate in this  provide the money that they need   The money came in basically overnight. We sent it over to Uganda. And over the next six months  a beautiful thing happened  the entrepreneurs received the money  they were paid  and their businesses  in fact  grew  and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives. In October of '    after those first seven loans were paid  Matt and I took the word beta off of the site. We said   Our little experiment has been a success. Let's start for real.  That was our official launch. And then that first year  October '   through '    Kiva facilitated          in loans. The second year  it was a total of    million. The third year  the total was up to around   . The fourth year  we were just short of    . And today  less than five years in  Kiva's facilitated more than     million dollars  in little    dollar bits  from lenders and entrepreneurs    more than a million of those  collectively in     countries. So that's where Kiva is today  just to bring you right up to the present. And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting  to me  Kiva's really about stories. It's about retelling the story of the poor  and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity  validates a partnership relationship  not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen. But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward. So what I hope is that  not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva    that's a very positive and meaningful thing    but I hope Kiva can blur those lines  like I said  between the traditional rich and poor categories that we're taught to see in the world  this false dichotomy of us and them  have and have not. I hope that Kiva can blur those lines. Because as that happens  I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open  more just and more creative  to engage with each other and to help each other. Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you're about to approach them. Imagine how you feel  and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business. Maybe they're smiling  and they want to talk to you about what they've done. Imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish  somebody who's using their talents to do something productive  somebody who's built their own business from scratch  someone who is surrounded by abundance  not scarcity  who's in fact creating abundance  somebody with full hands with something to offer  not empty hands asking for you to give them something. Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very  very hard to make their life better. These stories can really change the way that we think about each other. And if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money  I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other's potential. Now for me  Kiva is just the beginning. And as I look forward to what is next  it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far. The first one is  as I mentioned  entrepreneurship was a new idea to me. Kiva borrowers  as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years  have taught me what entrepreneurship is. And I think  at its core  it's deciding that you want your life to be better. You see an opportunity and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that. In short  it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that. Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity. So they're not a donation. Yeah  maybe it doesn't sound that much different. But in fact  when you give something to someone and they say   Thanks   and let you know how things go  that's one thing. When you lend them money  and they slowly pay you back over time  you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue. This continued attention    this ongoing attention    is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us. And then third  from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know  when all else is equal  given the option to have just money to do what you need to do  or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community  people choose the community plus the money. That's a much more meaningful combination  a more powerful combination. So with that in mind  this particular incident has led to the things that I'm working on now. I see entrepreneurs everywhere now  now that I'm tuned into this. And one thing that I've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world. With social networks  it's an amazing way  growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities  rapidly. And so  as I have been thinking about this  I've been wondering  how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today  As I've researched what's going on in the United States  a few interesting little insights have come up. So one is that  of course  as we all might expect  many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month. But there's always a need for resources close by. Another thing is  it turns out  those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect    banks  venture capitalists  other organizations and support structures    they come from friends and family. Some statistics say    percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family. That's around     billion dollars a year    it's a lot. And third  so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process  it's very awkward  people don't know exactly what to ask for  how to ask  what to promise in return  even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them. So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like  exactly what fits them and the people around them  this week actually  we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder  which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family. And it's investments  not donations  not loans  but investments that have a dynamic return. So the mapping of participating in the story  it actually flows with the up and down. So in short  it's a do it yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds. And what you can do is go onto the site  create a profile  create investment terms in a really easy way. We make it really  really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site. And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues. They can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited  unsophisticated investors    everyday people  heaven forbid    and they can share those returns over time    again  whatever terms they set. As investors choose to become involved based on those terms  they can either take their rewards back as cash  or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non profit. So they can be a cash  or a cause  investor. It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have  the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them  to gather them to make this happen. So that's what I'm working on now. And to close  I just want to say  look these are tools. Right now  Profounder's right at the very beginning  and it's very palpable  it's very clear to me  that it's just a vessel  it's just a tool. What we need are for people to care  to actually go use it  just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections. But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care    I'm not even going to try. I don't think  even though we often hear  you know  hear the ethical and moral reasons  the religious reasons   Here's why caring and giving will make you happier.  I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know  in fact  I think we know so much  and it's such a reality that we care so deeply  that in fact  what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up  because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives. So what I think I can do today  that best thing I can give you    I've given you my story  which is the best I can do. And I think I can remind us that we do care. I think we all already know that. And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try. Just a sec. Thanks. Thanks. For me  the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else's story. And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED. And I'm grateful that whenever I do that  guaranteed  I am inspired    I am inspired by the person I am listening to. And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help. And that    forget the tools  forget the moving around of resources    that stuff's easy. Believing in each other  really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world  that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us. So that  this belief in each other  knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do  that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today. Thank you. This technology made a very important impact on us. It changed the way our history developed. But it's a technology so pervasive  so invisible  that we  for a long time  forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution. But we see the results of this technology  still. So let's make a little test. So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please. Turn and face your neighbors. Please  also on the balcony. Smile. Smile. Open the mouths. Smile  friendly. Do you    Do you see any Canine teeth  Count Dracula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors  Of course not. Because our dental anatomy is actually made  not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours. It is made for a diet which is soft  mushy  which is reduced in fibers  which is very easily chewable and digestible. Sounds like fast food  doesn't it. It's for cooked food. We carry in our face the proof that cooking  food transformation  made us what we are. So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves. We talk about ourselves as omnivores. I would say  we should call ourselves coctivors    from coquere  to cook. We are the animals who eat cooked food. No  no  no  no. Better    to live of cooked food. So cooking is a very important technology. It's technology. I don't know how you feel  but I like to cook for entertainment. And you need some design to be successful. So  cooking is a very important technology  because it allowed us to acquire what brought you all here  the big brain  this wonderful cerebral cortex we have. Because brains are expensive. Those have to pay tuition fees know. But it's also  metabolically speaking  expensive. You now  our brain is two to three percent of the body mass  but actually it uses    percent of the total energy we use. It's very expensive. Where does the energy come from. Of course  from food. If we eat raw food  we cannot release really the energy. So this ingenuity of our ancestors  to invent this most marvelous technology. Invisible    everyone of us does it every day  so to speak. Cooking made it possible that mutations  natural selections  our environment  could develop us. So if we think about this unleashing human potential  which was possible by cooking and food  why do we talk so badly about food  Why is it always do and don'ts and it's good for you  it's not good for you  I think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing  the continuation of the unleashing of human potential. Now  cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species. We walked out of Africa two times. We populated all the ecologies. If you can cook  nothing can happen to you  because whatever you find  you will try to transform it. It keeps also your brain working. Now the very easy and simple technology which was developed actually runs after this formula. Take something which looks like food  transform it  and it gives you a good  very easy  accessible energy. This technology affected two organs  the brain and the gut  which it actually affected. The brain could grow  but the gut actually shrunk. Okay  it's not obvious to be honest. But it shrunk to    percent of primate gut of my body mass. So because of having cooked food  it's easier to digest. Now having a large brain  as you know  is a big advantage  because you can actually influence your environment. You can influence your own technologies you have invented. You can continue to innovate and invent. Now the big brain did this also with cooking. But how did it actually run this show  How did it actually interfere  What kind of criteria did it use  And this is actually taste reward and energy. You know we have up to five tastes  three of them sustain us. Sweet    energy. Umami    this is a meaty taste. You need proteins for muscles  recovery. Salty  because you need salt  otherwise your electric body will not work. And two tastes which protect you    bitter and sour  which are against poisonous and rotten material. But of course  they are hard wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way. Think about bittersweet chocolate  or think about the acidity of yogurt    wonderful    mixed with strawberry fruits. So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that  in cooking  we can transform it to the form. Reward  this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements    the external states  our internal states  how do we feel  and so on are put together. And something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat. So satisfaction was a very important part. And as I say  energy was necessary. Now how did the gut actually participate in this development  And the gut is a silent voice    it's going more for feelings. I use the euphemism digestive comfort    actually    it's a digestive discomfort  which the gut is concerned with. If you get a stomach ache  if you get a little bit bloated  was not the right food  was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong. So my story is a tale of two brains  because it might surprise you  our gut has a full fledged brain. All the managers in the room say   You don't tell me something new  because we know  gut feeling. This is what we are using.  And actually you use it and it's actually useful. Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system  they do speak with each other and make decisions. But what it means to have a brain there is that  not only the big brain has to talk with the food  the food has to talk with the brain  because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains. Now if there's a gut brain  we should also learn to talk with this brain. Now     years ago  anatomists described very  very carefully    here is a model of a wall of a gut. I took the three elements    stomach  small intestine and colon. And within this structure  you see these two pinkish layers  which are actually the muscle. And between this muscle  they found nervous tissues  a lot of nervous tissues  which penetrate actually the muscle    penetrate the submucosa  where you have all the elements for the immune system. The gut is actually the largest immune system  defending your body. It penetrates the mucosa. This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest  which is actually the lumen. Now if you think about the gut  the gut is    if you could stretch it       meters long  the length of a tennis court. If we could unroll it  get out all the folds and so on  it would have     sq. meters of surface. And now this brain takes care over this  to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and  of course  digest our food we cook. So if we give you a specification  this brain  which is autonomous  have     million nerve cells      million neurons    so around the size of a cat brain  so there sleeps a little cat    thinks for itself  optimizes whatever it digests. It has    different neuron types. It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain  where you have     billion neurons. It has autonomous organized microcircuits  has these programs which run. It senses the food  it knows exactly what to do. It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means  because it has to move the food    it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion. This control of muscle is very  very important  because  you know  there can be reflexes. If you don't like a food  especially if you're a child  you gag. It's this brain which makes this reflex. And then finally  it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery  which actually digests the food we cook. Now how do the two brains work with each other  I took here a model from robotics    it's called the Subsumption Architecture. What it means is that we have a layered control system. The lower layer  our gut brain  has its own goals    digestion defense    and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors. Now both look    and this is the blue arrows    both look to the same food  which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine. The big brain integrates signals  which come from the running programs of the lower brain  But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower. It can replace  or it can inhibit actually  signals. So if we take two types of signals    a hunger signal for example. If you have an empty stomach  your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin. It's a very big signal  it's sent to the brain says   Go and eat.  You have stop signals    we have up to eight stop signals. At least in my case  they are not listened to. So what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal  So if you override the hunger signal  you can have a disorder  which is called anorexia. Despite generating a healthy hunger signal  the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut. The more usual case is overeating. It actually takes the signal and changes it  and we continue  even  though  our eight signals would say   Stop  enough. We have transferred enough energy.  Now the interesting thing is that  along this lower layer    this gut    the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested  but digestible  material could penetrate. This we found from bariatric surgery. That then the signal would be very  very high. So now back to the cooking question and back to the design. We have learned to talk to the big brain    taste and reward  as you know. Now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it  Then we would generate something all of us would like to have    a balance between the hunger and the satiation. Now I give you  from our research  a very short claim. This is fat digestion. You have on your left an olive oil droplet  and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes. This is an in vitro experiment. It's very difficult to work in the intestine. Now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens  when the constituents are liberated  they disappear  they go away because they  were  absorbed. Actually  what happens is that a very intricate structure appears. And I hope you can see that there are some ring like structures in the middle image  which is water. This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil. And finally  on your right side  you see a bubbly  cell like structure appearing  from which the body will absorb the fat. Now if we could take this language    and this is a language of structures    and make it longer lasting  that it can go through the passage of the intestine  it would generate stronger signals. So our research    and I think the research also at the universities    are now fixing on these points to say  how can we actually    and this might sound trivial now to you    how can we change cooking  How can we cook that we have this language developed  So what we have actually  it's not an omnivore's dilemma. We have a coctivor's opportunity  because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward    quite sophisticated to cook    to please ourselves  to satisfy ourselves. If we add the matrix  if we add the structure language  which we have to learn  when we learn it  then we can put it back  and around energy  we could generate a balance  which comes out from our really primordial operation  cooking. So  to make cooking really a very important element  I would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is what made us. So I would say  coquo ergo sum  I cook  therefore I am. Thank you very much. I'm a visual artist  and I'm also one of the co founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. I've been working with plastic bags  which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last    years. I turn them into two and three dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations. Upon working with the plastic  after about the first eight years  some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic. And I thought   Great. It's ephemeral just like us.  Upon educating myself a little further about plastics  I actually realized this was a bad thing. It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits  because it's always still plastic. And what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment. I then  in the last few years  learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre. And my initial reaction    and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it    is   Oh my God  We've got to go out there and clean this thing up.  So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers  a crane  a chipping machine and a cold molding machine. And my intention was to go out to the gyre  raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic  chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities. I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so  I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world  and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture. And the bigger picture is  we need to find a way to turn off the faucet. We need to cut the spigot of single use and disposable plastics  which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale. So in looking at that  I also realized that I was really angry. I wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean    of which I have learned there are now    gyres  potentially  of plastic in five major oceans in the world. It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about    it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket. I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic. All of my beverages are packaged in plastic  even at the health food market. I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator  and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies. So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue  and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition. We have many initiatives that we're working on  but some of them are very basic. One is  if    to    percent of what we're finding in the ocean    of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean    is plastic  then why don't we call it what it is. It's plastic pollution. Recycling    everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling. You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again. What is the reality of that  In the United States  less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled. And if you really look into it  particularly when it comes to plastic bottles  most of it is only down cycled  or incinerated  or shipped to China. It is down cycled and turned into lesser things  while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again    a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again. So this is a big issue for us. Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth R onto the front of the  Reduce  Reuse  Recycle   three R's  and that is refuse. Whenever possible  refuse single use and disposable plastics. Alternatives exist  some of them are very old school. I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in. And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family. It's very easy to pick up a stainless steel bottle or a glass bottle  if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water  versus purchasing plastic bottled water. I guess what I want to say to everybody here    and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue    is that this is a huge problem in the oceans  but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve. We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives. So whenever possible  to choose alternatives to single use plastics. We can cut the stem    tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so  save our oceans  save our planet  save ourselves. Thank you.  Applause  So yeah  I'm a newspaper cartoonist    political cartoonist. I don't know if you've heard about it    newspapers  It's a sort of paper based reader. It's lighter than an iPad  it's a bit cheaper. You know what they say  They say the print media is dying    who says that  Well  the media. But this is no news  right  You've read about it already. Ladies and gentlemen  the world has gotten smaller. I know it's a cliche  but look  look how small  how tiny it has gotten. And you know the reason why  of course. This is because of technology    yeah. Any computer designers in the room  Yeah well  you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round  a nice round shape. That makes a good cartoon. But what are you going to do with a flat track pad  those square things  There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist. Well  I know the world is flat now. That's true. And the Internet has reached every corner of the world  the poorest  the remotest places. Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe. Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there. So we are bridging the digital divide. The Third World is connected  we are connected. And what happens next  Well  you've got mail. Yeah. Well  the Internet has empowered us. It has empowered you  it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well. You know  these last two cartoons    I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. And they were not used to that in communist  .  Vietnam. So I was cartooning live on a wide screen    it was quite a sensation    and then this guy came to me. He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches  and I thought   This is great  a Vietnamese fan.  And as he came the second day  I thought   Wow  that's really a cartoon lover.  And on the third day  I finally understood  the guy was actually on duty. So by now  there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police. No  but it's true  the Internet has changed the world. It has rocked the music industry  it has changed the way we consume music. For those of you old enough to remember  we used to have to go to the store to steal it. And it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application. So be careful with that Facebook account    your momma told you  be careful. And technology has set us free    this is free WiFi. But yeah  it has liberated us from the office desk. This is your life  enjoy it. In short  technology  the internet  they have changed our lifestyle. Tech guru  like this man    that a German magazine called the philosopher of the   st century    they are shaping the way we do things. They are shaping the way we consume. They are shaping our very desires. You will not like it. And technology has even changed our relationship to God. Now I shouldn't get into this. Religion and political cartoons  as you may have heard  make a difficult couple  ever since that day of       when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world    demonstrations  fatwa  they provoked violence. People died in the violence. This was so sickening  people died because of cartoons. I mean    I had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides  actually. They were used first by a Danish newspaper  which wanted to make a point on Islam. A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the    who received the assignment to draw the prophet       of them refused. Did you know that  He told me   Nobody has to tell me what I should draw. This is not how it works.  And then  of course  they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side. They wanted to stir up controversy. You know the story. We know that cartoons can be used as weapons. History tells us  they've been used by the Nazis to attack the Jews. And here we are now. In the United Nations  half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion    they call it the defamation of religion    while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech. So the clash of civilizations is here  and cartoons are at the middle of it  This got me thinking. Now you see me thinking at my kitchen table  and since you're in my kitchen  please meet my wife. In       a few months after  I went Ivory Coast    Western Africa. Now  talk of a divided place    the country was cut in two. You had a rebellion in the North  the government in the South    the capital  Abidjan    and in the middle  the French army. This looks like a giant hamburger. You don't want to be the ham in the middle. I was there to report on that story in cartoons. I've been doing this for the last    years  it's my side job  if you want. So you see the style is different. This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning. I went to places like Gaza during the war in     . So this is really journalism in cartoons. You'll hear more and more about it. This is the future of journalism  I think. And of course  I went to see the rebels in the north. Those were poor guys fighting for their rights. There was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in Africa. And I went to see the Dozo. The Dozo  they are the traditional hunters of West Africa. People fear them    they help the rebellion a lot. They are believed to have magical powers. They can disappear and escape bullets. I went to see a Dozo chief  he told me about his magical powers. He said   I can chop your head off right away and bring you back to life.  I said   Well  maybe we don't have time for this right now.   Another time.  So back in Abidjan  I was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and I thought  yes  in a context like this  cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side. I mean  the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided    it was compared to the media in Rwanda before the genocide    so imagine. And what can a cartoonist do  Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see  and the guy has to feed his family  right  So the idea was pretty simple. We brought together cartoonists from all sides in Ivory Coast. We took them away from their newspaper for three days. And I asked them to do a project together  tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons  yes  in cartoons. Show the positive power of cartoons. It's a great tool of communication for bad or for good. And cartoons can cross boundaries  as you have seen. And humor is a good way  I think  to address serious issues. And I'm very proud of what they did. I mean  they didn't agree with each other    that was not the point. And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons. The first day  they were even shouting at each other. But they came up with a book  looking back at    years of political crisis in Ivory Coast. So the idea was there. And I've been doing projects like this  in      in Lebanon  this year in Kenya  back in January. In Lebanon  it was not a book. The idea was to have    the same principal  a divided country    take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together. So in Lebanon  we enrolled the newspaper editors  and we got them to publish eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page  addressing the issue affecting Lebanon  like religion in politics and everyday life. And it worked. For three days  almost all the newspapers of Beirut published all those cartoonists together    anti government  pro government  Christian  Muslim  of course  English speaking  well  you name it. So this was a great project. And then in Kenya  what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity  which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa. And we did video clips    you can see them if you go to YouTube Kenyatoons. So  preaching for freedom of speech is easy here  but as you have seen in contexts of repression or division  again  what can a cartoonist do  He has to keep his job. Well I believe that in any context anywhere  he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred. And that's the message I try to convey to them. I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing. But we need to support these  unclear   critical and responsible voices in Africa  in Lebanon  in your local newspaper  in the Apple store. Today  tech companies are the world's largest editors. They decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see. So really  it's not about the freedom of cartoonists  it's about your freedoms. And for dictators all over the world  the good news is when cartoonists  journalists and activists shut up. Thank you. The big residual is always value for money. All the time we are trying to get value for money. What we don't look for is value for many  while we are generating value for money. Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day  the so called bottom of the pyramid  What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many  We have described here in terms of the performance and the price. If you have money  of course  you can get the value. You can get a Mercedes for a very high price  very high performance. But if you don't have money  what happens  Well  you are to ride a bicycle  carrying your own weight and also some other weight  so that you can earn the bread for the day. Well  poor do not remain poor  they become lower middle class. And if they do so  then  of course  the conditions improve  and they start riding on scooters. But the challenge is  again  they don't get much value  because they can't afford anything more than the scooter. The issue is  at that price  can you give them some extra value  A super value  in terms of their ability to ride in a car  to get that dignity  to get that safety  looks practically impossible  isn't it. Now  this is something that we see on Indian streets all the time. But many people see the same thing and think things differently  and one of them is here  Ratan Tata. The great thing about our leaders is that  should they not only have passion in their belly  which practically all of them have  they're also very innovative. An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done. They believe that things can be done. But great leaders like Ratan have compassion. And what you said  Lakshmi  is absolutely true  it's not just Ratan Tata  it's the house of Tatas over time. Let me confirm what she said. Yes  I went barefoot until I was   . I struggled to  unclear  day was a huge issue. And when I finished my SSC  the eleventh standard  I stood eleventh among         students. But I was about to leave the school  because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling. And it was  unclear  Tata Trust  which gave me six rupees per month  almost a dollar per month for six years. That's how I'm standing before you. So that is the House of Tata. Innovation  compassion and passion. They combine all that. And it was that compassion which bothered them  because when he saw    in fact  he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car    he drives his own car by the way    and he saw in the rain  a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant. And then he said   Well  I must give them a car that they can afford  one lakh car         car.  Of course  as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible  and that's what was said by Suzuki. He said  oh  probably he is going to build a three wheeler with stepney. And you can see the cartoon here. Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano. And mind you  I'm six feet half an inch  Ratan is taller than me  and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car. And incredible car. And of course  nothing succeeds like success  the cynics then turned around  and one after the other they also started saying   Yes  we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment. We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment.  How did this great story unfold  the making of Nano  Let me tell you a bit about it. For example  how we started  Ratan just began with a five engineer team  young people in their mid twenties. And he said   Well  I won't define the vehicle for you  but I will define the cost for you. It is one lakh          rupees  and you are to make it within that.  And he told them   Question the unquestionable. Stretch the envelope.  And at a point in time  he got so engrossed in the whole challenge  that he himself became a member of the team. Can you believe it  I still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated. Until midnight  he'd be thinking. Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions. But who was the team leader  The team leader was Girish Wagh  a    year old boy in  unclear . And the Nano team average age was just    years. And they did innovation in design and beyond. Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time. For example  that a two cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft. Adhesives were replacing the rivets. There was a co creation  a huge co creation  with vendors and suppliers. All ideas on board were welcome.     vendors were co located adjacent to the plant  and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed. Imagine that a fellow who sells cloth  for example  will be selling Nano. I mean  it was incredible innovation. Seeking solutions for non auto sectors. It was an open innovation  ideas from all over were welcome. The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used  by the way  as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two wheelers. The fuel lines and lamps were as in two wheelers. And the crux of the matter was  however  getting more from less. All the time  you have been given an envelope. You can't cross that envelope  which is         rupees        dollars. And therefore  each component had to have a dual functionality. And the seat riser  for example  serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity. Half the number of parts are contained in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car. The length is smaller by eight percent by the way. But the current entry level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less  but    percent more inside space. And what happened was that    more from less    you can see how much more for how much less. When the Model T was launched    and this is  by the way  all the figures that are adjusted to      dollar prices    Model T was        by Ford. Volkswagon was       . And British Motor was around       . And Nano was  bang        dollars. This is why you started actually a new paradigm shift  where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car  who were carrying their entire family in a scooter  started dreaming of being in a car. And those dreams are getting fulfilled. This is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home. The driver's name is Naran. He has bought his own Nano. And you can see  there is a physical space that has been created for him  parking that car  along with the owner's car  but more importantly  they've created a space in their mind that  Yes  my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it.  And that's why I call it a transformational innovation. It is not just technological  it is social innovation that we talk about. And that is where  ladies and gentlemen  this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important. I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia  about one and a half years ago  when their academy honored me with a fellowship. And unbelievably  in    years  I was the first Indian to be honored. And the title of my talk was therefore  Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering.  And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering. And Gandhian engineering  in my judgment  is the one which is going to take the world forward  is going to make a difference  not just for a few  but for everyone. Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs. Here is an American citizen and his son having an artificial foot. What is its price         dollars. And of course  these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads. Unfortunately  that's not the case in India. You can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land  sometimes in a marshy land  and so on and so forth. More importantly  they not only walk far to work  and not only do they cycle to work  but they cycle for work  as you can see here. And they climb up for their work. You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions. A challenge  of course. Four billion people  their incomes are less then two dollars a day. And if you talk about a        dollar shoe  you're talking about        days of income. You just don't have it. And therefore  you ought to look at alternatives. And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India. It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system  a quick molding and modular components  enabling custom made  on the spot limb fitments. You could feel it actually in an hour  by the way  whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day  as so on. Outer socket made by using heated high density polyethylene pipes  rather than using heated sheets. And unique high ankle design and human like looks   unclear  and functions. And I like to show how it looks and how it works. See  he jumps. You can see what stress it must have. ... above the limb  yes  it would be difficult ...  Did it hurt    No ... not at all.  ... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and    seconds ...  One kilometer in four minutes and    seconds. So that's what it is all about. And therefore Time took notice of this    dollar foot  basically. An incredible story. Let's move on to something else. I've been talking about getting more from less for more. Let's move to health. We've talked about mobility and the rest of it  let's talk about health. What's happening in the area of health  You know  you have new diseases that require new drugs. And if you look at the drug development    years ago and now  what has happened     years ago  it used to cost about a quarter billion. Today it costs  .  billion dollars. Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace  after all the human and animal testing  was    years  now it is    years. Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money  No  I'm sorry. We used to have     now they have come down to   . So actually we are getting less from more for less and less people. Why less and less people  Because it is so expensive  so very few will be able to basically afford that. Let us just take an example. Psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin. The cost of treatment         dollars.       dollar antibody injections under the skin  by the way  and    of them. Time for development    it took around    years and     million dollars. Let's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets. For example  we don't want        dollars  we don't have it. Can we do it  for      dollars  Time for development  not    years. We are in a hurry. Five years. Cost of development        million dollars. Sorry. I can't spend more than    million dollars. Looks absolutely audacious. Looks absolutely ridiculous. You know something  This has been achieved in India. These targets have been achieved in India. And how they have been achieved ... Sir Francis Bacon once said   When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before  it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before.  And therefore  the standard process  where you develop a molecule  put it into mice  into men  are not yielding those results    the billions of dollars that have been spent. The Indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge  however  scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men  not molecule to mice to men  you know. And that is how this difference has come. And you can see this blending of traditional medicine  modern medicine  modern science. I launched a big program  unclear  CSIR about nine years ago. He is giving us not just for Psoriasis  for cancer and a whole range of things  changing the whole paradigm. And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of  unclear  by doing things differently. You can see before treatment and after treatment. This is really getting more from less for more and more people  because these are all affordable treatments now. Let me just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi had said. He had said   Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need  but not every man's greed.  So the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people  not only the current generation  but the future generations. And he also said   I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all.  So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people  not just a few people. And therefore  ladies and gentlemen  this is the theme  getting more from less for more. And mind you  it is not getting just a little more for just a little less. It's not about low cost. It's about ultra low cost. You cannot say it's a mere treatment        dollars  but because you are poor I'll give it for      . Sorry  it doesn't work. You have to give it for     dollars      dollars. Is it possible  It has been made possible  by the way  for certain other different reasons. So you are not talking about low cost  you are talking about ultra low cost. You are not talking about affordability  you are talking about extreme affordability. Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day. You're not talking exclusive innovation. You're talking about inclusive innovation. And therefore  you're not talking about incremental innovation  you're talking about disruptive innovation. The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms. And I would also add  it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people  the whole world working for it. I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day. You know  incubators for infants  for example. They're not available in Africa. They're not available in Indian villages. And infants die. And incubator costs       dollars. And there's a    dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created. And by whom  By young students from Standford University on an extreme affordability project that they had  basically. Their heart is in the right place  like Ratan Tata. It's not just innovation  compassion and passion    compassion in the heart and passion in the belly. That's the new world that we want to create. And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering. Ladies and gentlemen  I'd like to end before time. I was also afraid of those    minutes. I've still one and a half to go. The message  the final message  is this  India gave a great gift to the world. What was that   In the    th century  we gave Gandhi to the world. The   st century gift  which is very  very important for the whole world  whether it is global economic meltdown  whether it is climate change    any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more    not only the current generations  for the future generations. And that can come only from Gandhian engineering. So ladies and gentlemen  I'm very happy to announce  this gift of the   st century to the world from India  Gandhian engineering. Lakshmi Pratury  Thank you  Dr. Mashelkar.  R.A. Mashelkar  Thank you very much.  LP  A quick question for you. Now  when you were a young boy in this school  what were your thoughts  like what did you think you could become  What do you think that drove you  Was there a vision you had  What is it that drove you  RAM  I'll tell you a story that drove me  that transformed my life. I remember  I went to a poor school  because my mother could not gather the    rupees  that half a dollar that was required within the stipulated time. It was  unclear  high school. But it was a poor school with rich teachers  honestly. And one of them was  unclear  who taught us physics. One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens. The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down. And there was a bright spot up there. And then he said   This is the focal length.  But then he held it for a little while  Lakshmi. And then the paper burned. When the paper burned  for some reason he turned to me  and he said   Mashelkar  like this  if you do not diffuse your energies  if you focus your energies  you can achieve anything in the world.  That gave me a great message  focus and you can achieve. I said   Whoa  science is so wonderful  I have to become a scientist.  But more importantly  focus and you can achieve. And that message  very frankly  is valuable for society today. What does that focal length do  It has parallel lines  which are sun rays. And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet. What does that convex lens do  It makes them meet. This is convex lens leadership. You know what today's leadership is doing  Concave length. They divide them farther. So I learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that. And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory  unclear . When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research       laboratories    when two laboratories were not talking to each other  I would  unclear . And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance         scientists in nine counties  right from India to the U.S. I'm trying to build a global team  which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing. That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment. LP  Thank you very much.  RAM  Thank you.  I'm going to talk to you about power in this   st century. And basically  what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing  and there are two types of changes I want to discuss. One is power transition  which is change of power amongst states. And there the simple version of the message is it's moving from West to East. The other is power diffusion  the way power is moving from all states West or East to non state actors. Those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century. And I want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why  in the end  there may be some good news. When we talk about power transition  we often talk about the rise of Asia. It really should be called the recovery or return of Asia. If we looked at the world in       you'd find that more than half of the world's people lived in Asia and they made more than half the world's product. Now fast forward to       half the world's people    more than half    still live in Asia  but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product. What happened  The Industrial Revolution  which meant that all of a sudden  Europe and America became the dominant center of the world. What we're going to see in the   st century is Asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product. That's important and it's an important shift. But let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that I'm talking about  which is power diffusion. To understand power diffusion put this in your mind  computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between      and the beginning of this century. Now that's a big abstract number. But to make it more real  if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power  you could buy a car today for five dollars. Now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically  the barriers to entry go down. Anybody can play in the game. So in       if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously  you could do it. The technology was there. But to be able to do it  you had to be very rich    a government  a multinational corporation  maybe the Catholic Church    but you had to be pretty wealthy. Now  anybody has that capacity  which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors. If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe    the last time I looked  it was something like a pound an hour    and if you have Skype  it's free. So capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone. And what that means is not that the age of the State is over. The State still matters. But the stage is crowded. The State's not alone. There are many  many actors. Some of that's good  Oxfam  a great non governmental actor. Some of it's bad  Al Qaeda  another non governmental actor. But think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts. We think in terms of war and interstate war. And you can think back to      when the government of Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. It's worth noticing that a non state actor attacking the United States in      killed more Americans than the government of Japan did in     . You might think of that as the privatization of war. So we're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power. Now the problem is that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways. So let me step back and ask  what's power  Power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want  and you can do it in three ways. You can do it with threats of coercion   sticks   you can do it with payments   carrots   or you can do it by getting others to want what you want. And that ability to get others to want what you want  to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment  is what I call soft power. And that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood  and yet it's tremendously important. Indeed  if you can learn to use more soft power  you can save a lot on carrots and sticks. Traditionally  the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power. For example  the great Oxford historian who taught here at this university  A.J.P. Taylor  defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war. But we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the   st century. It's not just prevailing at war  though war still persists. It's not whose army wins  it's also whose story wins. And we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective. Now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what's happening there. the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers. And the current narrative is all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States. Indeed  with the      financial crisis  many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power. The tectonic plates of world politics were shifting. And president Medvedev of Russia  for example  pronounced in      this was the beginning of the end of United States power. But in fact  this metaphor of decline is often very misleading. If you look at history  in recent history  you'll see the cycles of belief in American decline come and go every    or    years or so. In       after the Soviets put up Sputnik  it was  That's the end of America.  In       with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window  that was the end of America. In the     s  as America went through a transition in the Reagan period  between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California  that was the end of America. But in fact  what we've seen is none of those were true. Indeed  people were over enthusiastic in the early     s  thinking America could do anything  which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures  and now we're back to decline again. The moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality. If we try to focus on the reality  then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of China and the United States. Goldman Sachs has projected that China  the Chinese economy  will surpass that of the U.S. by     . So we've got  what     more years to go or so before China's bigger. Now someday  with a billion point three people getting richer  they are going to be bigger than the United States. But be very careful about these projections such as the Goldman Sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century. Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple. First of all  it's a linear projection. You know  everything says  here's the growth rate of China  here's the growth rate of the U.S.  here it goes    straight line. History is not linear. There are often bumps along the road  accidents along the way. The second thing is that the Chinese economy passes the U.S. economy in  let's say        which it may it  that will be a measure of total economic size  but not of per capita income    won't tell you about the composition of the economy. China still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy. And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part  after       of this century. The other point that's worth noticing is how one dimensional this projection is. You know  it looks at economic power measured by GDP. Doesn't tell you much about military power  doesn't tell you very much about soft power. It's all very one dimensional. And also  when we think about the rise of Asia  or return of Asia as I called it a little bit earlier  it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing. If you're sitting in Japan  or in New Delhi  or in Hanoi  your view of the rise of China is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing. Indeed  one of the advantages that the Americans will have in terms of power in Asia is all those countries want an American insurance policy against the rise of China. It's as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States  which they're not. So these simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition. But you might ask  well so what in any case  Why does it matter  Who cares  Is this just a game that diplomats and academics play  The answer is it matters quite a lot. Because  if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this  the facts  not the myths  you may have policies which are very dangerous. Let me give you an example from history. The Peloponnesian War was the great conflict in which the Greek city state system tore itself apart two and a half millennia ago. What caused it  Thucydides  the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War  said it was the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta. Notice both halves of that explanation. Many people argue that the   st century is going to repeat the   th century  in which World War One  the great conflagration in which the European state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world  that that was caused by the rise in the power of Germany and the fear it created in Britain. So there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today  that what we're going to see is the same thing now in this century. No  I think that's wrong. It's bad history. For one thing  Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial strength by     . And as I said earlier  China has not passed the United States. But also  if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear  it leads to overreaction. And the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context  the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself. We don't have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia. And if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective  we're going to be able to manage this process. Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together. If you ask how is power distributed in the world today  it's distributed much like a three dimensional chess game. Top board  military power among states. The United States is the only superpower  and it's likely to remain that way for two or three decades. China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board. Middle board of this three dimensional chess game  economic power among states. Power is multi polar. There are balancers    the U.S.  Europe  China  Japan can balance each other. The bottom board of this three dimensional  the board of transnational relations  things that cross borders outside the control of governments  things like climate change  drug trade  financial flows  pandemics  all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments  there nobody's in charge. It makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi polar. Power is chaotically distributed. And the only way you can solve these problems    and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century    is through cooperation  through working together  which means that soft power becomes more important  that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation. Another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the   st century  we want to get away from the idea that power's always zero sum    my gain is your loss and vice versa. Power can also be positive sum  where your gain can be my gain. If China develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions  that's good for us as well as good for China as well as good for everybody else. So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody  and it's not a zero sum  I win  you lose. It's one in which we can all gain. So as we think about power in this century  we want to get away from this view that it's all I win  you lose. Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this. Wars persist. Power persists. Military power is important. Keeping balances is important. All this still persists. Hard power is there  and it will remain. But unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that I call smart power  you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we're facing. So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods  things from which all of us can benefit  How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum  but positive sum. In that sense  if we define our interests  for example  for the United States the way Britain defined its interests in the   th century  keeping an open trading system  keeping a monetary stability  keeping freedom of the seas    those were good for Britain  they were good for others as well. And in the   st century  you have to do an analog to that. How do we produce global public goods  which are good for us  but good for everyone at the same time  And that's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the   st century. There are ways to define our interests in which  while protecting ourselves with hard power  we can organize with others in networks to produce  not only public goods  but ways that will enhance our soft power. So if one looks at the statements that have been made about this  I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton described the foreign policy of the Obama administration  she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration was going to be smart power  as she put it   using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box.  And if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that I've described  the power shift represented by transition among states  the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states  we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power. And that's the good news I have. We can do that. Thank you very much. Sustainability represents the what  the where and the how of what is caught. The who and the why are what's important to me. I want to know the people behind my dinner choices. I want to know how I impact them. I want to know how they impact me. I want to know why they fish. I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty for their living. Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat. So what do we call this  I think we call it restorative seafood. Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain  restorative is the ability to replenish and progress. Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource  suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency. It is a more hopeful  it is a more human  and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. Wallet guides    standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world    are very handy  they're a wonderful tool. Green  yellow and red lists  of  seafood species. The association is very easy  buy green  don't buy red  think twice about yellow. But in my mind  it's really not enough to just eat green list. We can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red. But what if we eat only in the green list  You've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here    comes from sustainable stocks. Pole caught    no bycatch. Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies. But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator. What's the context of this meal  Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a    ounce portion of this  Do I do this three times a week  I might still be in the green list  but I'm not doing myself  or you  or the oceans any favors. The point is that we have to have a context  a gauge for our actions in all this. Example  I've heard that red wine is great for my health    antioxidants and minerals    heart healthy. That's great  I love red wine  I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy. Well  how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem  Well folks  we have a protein problem. We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food  and we are paying a cost. The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves. We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines. And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs. Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws  or by Flipper  or the Gordon's fisherman  but rather  by the Jolly Green Giant. Vegetables  they might yet save the oceans. Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green. Well I'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue. We must continue to eat the best seafood possible  if at all. But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables. The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges. It comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy  broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy  grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake. Whooo  This is an easy sell. And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat. Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat. There's a pattern here. Forget nuclear holocaust  it's the fork that we have to worry about. We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one. So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong. And so I think it's time we change what we expect from our food. Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand. So let's start there. There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems. Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution. But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters. Just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate. We have eco friendly shrimp. We can make them  we have that technology. But we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet. It doesn't work. Heart healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood. While we try to manage declining marine populations  the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood. Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers  grandfathers  mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood. That's a reward I am not willing to pass up. But it's not all about the seafood. It's about the way that we look at our plates. As a chef  I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate. A couple things happened. I made more money. People started buying appetizers and salads  because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone. People spent more time engaging in their meals  engaging with each other over their meals. People got  in short  more of what they came there for even though they got less protein. They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal. They got healthier. I made more money. This is great. Environmental consideration was served with every plate  but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time. One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served    small silverfish  anchovies  mackerel  sardines were uncommon. Shellfish  mussels  oysters  clams  tilapia  char    these were the common species. We were directing tastes towards more resilience  more restorative options. This is what we need to favor. This is what the green list says. But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment. But what of those big predators  those fashionable species  that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier  Well  if you must  I have a recipe for you. It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean  so here we go. Start with a    ounce portion of big fish. Get a knife. Cut it into four portions. Put it on four plates. Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have  light the candles and celebrate it. Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this. Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year  maybe. I expect a lot from food. I expect health and joy and family and community. I expect that producing ingredients  preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests. I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook. And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents. I remember well the meals of my childhood. They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch  usually rice. This is still how I largely eat today. I get sick when I go to steakhouses. I get the meat sweats. It's like a hangover from protein. It's disgusting. But of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans  I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right. Eat your vegetables. It's pretty straightforward. So what are we looking for in a meal  Well for health  I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body. For joy  I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance. For family  I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories. For community though  we start at the very beginning. There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact. So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it. We've seen an image of our blue planet  our world bank. But it is more than just a repository of our resources  it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner. So if we all take only what we need  then we can begin to share the rest  we can begin to celebrate  we can begin to restore. We need to savor vegetables. We need to savor smaller portions of seafood. And we need to save dinner. Thank you. I'm a bug lover  myself    not from childhood  by the way  but rather late. When I bachelored  majoring in zoology in Tel Aviv University  I kind of fell in love with bugs. And then  within zoology  I took the course or the discipline of entomology  the science of insects. And then I thought  myself  how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology  And then I moved to the world of plant protection    plant protection from insects  from bad bugs. And then within plant protection  I came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests. So it's a whole discipline in plant protection that's aiming at the reduction of chemicals. And biological pest control  by the way  or these good bugs that we are talking about  they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years  for a long  long time. But only in the last     years people started  or people knew more and more how to exploit  or how to use  this biological control phenomenon  or in fact  natural control phenomenon  to their own needs. Because biological control phenomenon  you can see it in your backyard. Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here  That's a magnifier times   . Yeah  times   . Just open it. You just twist leaves  and you see a whole new world of minute insects  or little spiders of one millimeter  one and a half  two millimeters long  and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones. So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere. Here  in front of this building  I'm sure. Just have a look at the plants. So it's everywhere  and we need to know how to exploit it. Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples. What is a pest  What damage  does  it actually inflict on the plant  And what is the natural enemy  the biologically controlled agent  or the good bug  that we are talking about  In general  I'm going to talk about insects and spiders  or mites  let us call them. Insects  those six legged organisms and spiders or mites  the eight legged organisms. Let's have a look at that. Here is a pest  devastating pest  a spider mite  because it does a lot of webbing like a spider. You see the mother in between and two daughters  probably on the left and right  and a single egg on the right hand side. And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict. On your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf  and on the middle  cotton leaf  and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings. They can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking  piercing mouthparts of those spiders. But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider. This is a predatory mite    just as small as a spider mite  by the way  one millimeter  two millimeters long  not more than that  running quickly  hunting  chasing the spider mites. And here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side    just pierces  sucks the body fluids on the left hand side of the pest mite. And after five minutes  this is what you see  just a typical dead corpse  shriveled  sucked out  dead corpse of the spider mite  and next to it  two satiated individuals of predatory mites  a mother on the left hand side  a young nymph on the right hand side. By the way  a meal for them for    hours is about five individuals of the spider mites  of the bad mites  or    to    eggs of the pest mites. By the way  they are hungry always. And there is another example  aphids. By the way  it's springtime now in Israel. When temperature rises sharply  you can see those bad ones  those aphids  all over the plants  in your hibiscus  in your lantana  in the young  fresh foliage of the spring flush  so called. By the way  with aphids you have only females  like Amazons. Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females. No males at all. Parthenogenesis   as it  was so called. And they are very happy with that  apparently. Here we can see the damage. Those aphids secrete some sticky  sugary liquid called honeydew  and this just globs the upper parts of the plant. Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus  sooty mold  which is covering it. And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp. Here we are not talking about a predator. Here we are talking a parasite    not a two legged parasite  but an eight legged parasite  of course. This is a parasitic wasp  again  two millimeters long  slender  a very quick and sharp flier. And here you can see this parasite in action  like in an acrobatic maneuver. She stands vis a vis in front of the victim at the right hand side  bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg  a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid. By the way  the aphid tries to escape. She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids  but nothing will happen  in fact. Only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid. And after a few days  depending upon temperature  the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside. This is all natural. This is all natural. This is not fiction  nothing at all. Again  in your backyard  in your backyard. But this is the end result. This is the end result  Mummies    M U M M Y. This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside  in fact  a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out. The birth is almost complete. You can see  by the way  in different movies  etc.  it takes just a few minutes. And if this is a female  she'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short. This female can live only three to four days  and she needs to give rise to around     eggs. That means she has     bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids. And this is of course not the end of it. There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example. Again  we'll start first with the pest  the thrips. By the way  all these weird names    I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures  okay  just the popular names. But this is a nice  slender  very bad pest. If you can see this  sweet peppers. This is not just an exotic  ornamental sweet pepper. This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults. And here comes the natural enemy  minute pirate bug   minute  because it is rather small. Here you can see the adult  black  and two young ones. And again  in action. This adult pierces the thrips  sucking it within just several minutes  just going to the other prey  continuing all over the place. And if we spread those minute pirate bugs  the good ones  for example  in a sweet pepper plot  they go to the flowers. And look  this flower is flooded with predatory bugs  with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones  the thrips. So this is a very positive situation  by the way. No harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set. Everything is just fine under these circumstances. But again  the question is  here you saw them on a one to one basis    the pest  the natural enemy. What we do is actually this. In Northeast Israel  in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu  there is a facility that mass produces those natural enemies. In other words  what we do there  we amplify  we amplify the natural control  or the biological control phenomenon. And in        square meters of state of the art greenhouses  there  we are mass producing those predatory mites  those minute pirate bugs  those parasitic wasps  etc.  etc. Many different parts. By the way  they have a very nice landscape    you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand  and a good  mild winter and a nice  hot summer  which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures. And by the way  mass production    it is not genetic manipulation. There are no GMOs    Genetically Modified Organisms    whatsoever. We take them from nature  and the only thing that we do  we give them the optimal conditions  under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms  in order to proliferate  multiply and reproduce. And that's what we get  in fact. You see under a microscope. You see in the upper left corner  you see a single predatory mite. And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites. You see this ampoule. You see this one. I have one gram of those predatory mites. One gram's        individuals         individuals are good enough to control one acre        square meters  of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year. And we can produce from this  believe you me  several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis. So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon. And no  we do not disrupt the balance. On the contrary  because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals. Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals. That's the whole idea. And what is the impact  In this table  you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs. For example  in Israel  where we employ more than       hectares           dunams in Israeli terms    of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection     percent of the pesticides were actually reduced. And Israeli strawberries  even more       percent of the pesticides  especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries. So the impact is very strong. And there goes the question  especially if you ask growers  agriculturists  Why biological control  Why good bugs  By the way  the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask. But if we go  for example  to this place  Southeast Israel  the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley  where the really top notch    the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located  especially under greenhouse conditions  or under screenhouse conditions    if you drive all the way to Eilat  you see this just in the middle of the desert. And if you zoom in  you can definitely watch this  grandparents with their grandchildren  distributing the natural enemies  the good bugs  instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals. So safety  with respect to the application  this is the number one answer that we get from growers  why biological control. Number two  many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance  that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals  just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics. It's the same  and it can happen very quickly. Fortunately  in either biological control or even natural control  resistance is extremely rare. It hardly happens. Because this is evolution  this is the natural ratio  unlike resistance  which happens in the case of chemicals. And thirdly  public demand. Public demand    the more the public demands the reduction of chemicals  the more growers become aware of the fact they should  wherever they can and wherever possible  replace the chemical control with biological control. Even here  there is another grower  you see  very interested in the bugs  the bad ones and the good ones  wearing this magnifier already on her head  just walking safely in her crop. Finally  I want to get actually to my vision  or in fact  to my dream. Because  you see  this is the reality. Have a look at the gap. If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide  it's     million dollars. And look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world. I think it's times     or something like that. Twenty five billion. So there is a huge gap to bridge. So actually  how can we do it  How can we bridge  or let's say  narrow  this gap in the course of the years  First of all  we need to find more robust  good and reliable biological solutions  more good bugs that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field. Secondly  to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce. And thirdly  also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry. And this gap really narrows. Step by step  it does narrow. So I think my last slide is  All we are saying  we can actually sing it  Give nature a chance. So I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers  in Israel and abroad  really give nature a chance. Thank you. I love video games. I'm also slightly in awe of them. I'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination  in terms of technology  in terms of concept. But I think  above all  I'm in awe at their power to motivate  to compel us  to transfix us  like really nothing else we've ever invented has quite done before. And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this. And in particular  I think we can learn things about learning. Now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media. From about    billion in       it's worth    billion dollars globally today  and it shows no sign of slowing down. In four years' time  it's estimated it'll be worth over    billion dollars. That's about three times the recorded music industry. This is pretty stunning  but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all. The thing that really amazes me is that  today  people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games. This is a screenshot from the virtual game world  Entropia Universe. Earlier this year  a virtual asteroid in it sold for         real dollars. And this is a Titan class ship in the space game  EVE Online. And this virtual object takes     real people about    days of real time to build  plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that. And yet  many of these get built. At the other end of the scale  the game Farmville that you may well have heard of  has    million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day. This may all sound really quite alarming to some people  an index of something worrying or wrong in society. But we're here for the good news  and the good news is that I think we can explore why this very real human effort  this very intense generation of value  is occurring. And by answering that question  I think we can take something extremely powerful away. And I think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards. And specifically  it's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively. Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head when they are being engaged  two quite different processes are occurring. On the one hand  there's the wanting processes. This is a bit like ambition and drive    I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard. On the other hand  there's the liking processes  fun and affection and delight and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back. It's a really great image. It's pretty cool. It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than    million players globally  one of whom is me  another of whom is my wife. And this kind of a world  this vast flying beast you can ride around  shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking. Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome. It gives you great powers. Your ambition is satisfied  but it's very beautiful. It's a very great pleasure to fly around. And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement. But this isn't the really interesting stuff. The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it. Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything. Every single thing that every single person who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured. The biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players  about what everybody does    far more detail than you'd ever get from any website. And this allows something very special to happen in games. It's something called the reward schedule. And by this  I mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate  the nature  the type  the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort. Now  to try and explain this in sort of real terms  I want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games. Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game y item. Let's say  for the sake of argument  my mission is to get    pies and I can get    pies by killing these cute  little monsters. Simple game quest. Now you can think about this  if you like  as a problem about boxes. I've got to keep opening boxes. I don't know what's inside them until I open them. And I go around opening box after box until I've got    pies. Now  if you take a game like Warcraft  you can think about it  if you like  as a great box opening effort. The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes  getting better and better stuff in them. This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling. And the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data. Let's think about probability. If we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies  we want to make sure it's neither too easy  nor too difficult  to find a pie. So what do you do  Well  you look at a million people    no      million people      million box openers    and you work out  if you make the pie rate about    percent    that's neither too frustrating  nor too easy. It keeps people engaged. But of course  that's not all you do    there's    pies. Now  I could make a game called Piecraft  where all you had to do was get a million pies or a thousand pies. That would be very boring. Fifteen is a pretty optimal number. You find that    you know  between five and    is about the right number for keeping people going. But we don't just have pies in the boxes. There's     percent up here. And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened  there's something in it  some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged. In most adventure games  it's a little bit in game currency  a little bit experience. But we don't just do that either. We also say there's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement. There's going to be a    percent chance you get a pretty good item. There's going to be a  .  percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item. And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item. And also  we say   Well  how many monsters  Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters   No  we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time. So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy  not too difficult. So all this is very powerful. But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes. So we can do some rather amazing things. We notice  looking at all these people opening boxes  that when people get to about    out of    pies  their perception shifts  they start to get a bit bored  a bit testy. They're not rational about probability. They think this game is unfair. It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up. If they're real boxes  there's not much we can do  but in a game we can just say   Right  well. When you get to    pies  you've got    percent chance of getting a pie now.  Keep you engaged. Look at what people do    adjust the world to match their expectation. Our games don't always do this. And one thing they certainly do at the moment is if you got a  .  percent awesome item  they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time to keep the value  to keep it special. And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways. Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years  we evolved to find certain things stimulating  and as very intelligent  civilized beings  we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning. But now  we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes. So what does all this mean in practice  Well  I've come up with seven things that  I think  show how you can take these lessons from games and use them outside of games. The first one is very simple  experience bars measuring progress    something that's been talked about brilliantly by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year. It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States  among other places. It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces  you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny  tiny  tiny little increments which they feel are their own. And everything comes towards that  and they watch it creeping up  and they own that as it goes along. Second  multiple long and short term aims          pies  boring     pies  interesting. So  you give people lots and lots of different tasks. You say  it's about doing    of these questions  but another task is turning up to    classes on time  but another task is collaborating with other people  another task is showing you're working five times  another task is hitting this particular target. You break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities. Third  you reward effort. It's your     percent factor. Games are brilliant at this. Every time you do something  you get credit  you get a credit for trying. You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort    a little bit of gold  a little bit of credit. You've done    questions    tick. It all feeds in as minute reinforcement. Fourth  feedback. This is absolutely crucial  and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this. If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today that we've been hearing amazing things about  it's very  very hard for people to learn if they cannot link consequences to actions. Pollution  global warming  these things    the consequences are distant in time and space. It's very hard to learn  to feel a lesson. But if you can model things for people  if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes  then they can learn a lesson  they can see  they can move on  they can understand. And fifth  the element of uncertainty. Now this is the neurological goldmine  if you like  because a known reward excites people  but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward  the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty  that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not. The    percent. This lights the brain up. And if you think about using this in testing  in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training  you can transform the levels of people's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism. When we don't quite predict something perfectly  we get really excited about it. We just want to go back and find out more. As you probably know  the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine. It's associated with reward seeking behavior. And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.  where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain. And what this means is we can predict learning  we can predict enhanced engagement  these windows  these windows of time  in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level. And two things really flow from this. The first has to do with memory  that we can find these moments. When someone is more likely to remember  we can give them a nugget in a window. And the second thing is confidence  that we can see how game playing and reward structures make people braver  make them more willing to take risks  more willing to take on difficulty  harder to discourage. This can all seem very sinister. But you know  sort of  our brains have been manipulated  we're all addicts.  The word  addiction  is thrown around. There are real concerns there. But the biggest neurological turn on for people is other people. This is what really excites us. In reward terms  it's not money  it's not being given cash    that's nice    it's doing stuff with our peers  watching us  collaborating with us. And I want to tell you a quick story about         a video game called EverQuest. And in this video game  there were two really big dragons  and you had to team up to kill them       people  up to    to kill these big dragons. That's a problem because they dropped two or three decent items. So players addressed this problem by spontaneously coming up with a system to motivate each other  fairly and transparently. What happened was  they paid each other a virtual currency they called  dragon kill points.  And every time you turned up to go on a mission  you got paid in dragon kill points. They tracked these on a separate website. So they tracked their own private currency  and then players could bid afterwards for cool items they wanted    all organized by the players themselves. Now the staggering system  not just that this worked in EverQuest  but that today  a decade on  every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system    tens of millions of people. And the success rate is at close to     percent. This is a player developed  self enforcing  voluntary currency  and it's incredibly sophisticated player behavior. And I just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world. Let's start with business. I mean  we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation. We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real time energy meters. And I just look at this  and I think  yes  we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets  by using elements of uncertainty  by using these multiple targets  by using a grand  underlying reward and incentive system  by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups  in terms of streets to collaborate and compete  to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see. In terms of education  perhaps most obviously of all  we can transform how we engage people. We can offer people the grand continuity of experience and personal investment. We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks. We can use calculated randomness. We can reward effort consistently as everything fields together. And we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together  these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms. Government  well  one thing that comes to mind is the U.S. government  among others  is literally starting to pay people to lose weight. So we're seeing financial reward being used to tackle the great issue of obesity. But again  those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal  to take the data  to take the observations  of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement. And in the end  it's this word   engagement   that I want to leave you with. It's about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games. But it's also about collective engagement and about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games. And if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards  then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands. Thank you very much. So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does. We stand in elections  we vote in elections  we observe elections. Our democracies rely on elections. We all understand why we have elections  and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote. We cherish the opportunity to have our say  to help decide the future of the country. The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us  to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all. Without that mandate  they would be corrupt. Well unfortunately  power corrupts  and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power  including doing bad things to elections. You see  even if the idea of the election is perfect  running a countrywide election is a big project  and big projects are messy. Whenever there is an election  it seems like something always goes wrong  someone tries to cheat  or something goes accidentally awry    a ballot box goes missing here  chads are left hanging over here. To make sure as few things as possible go wrong  we have all these procedures around the election. So for example  you come to the polling station  and a poll station worker asks for your ID before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote. When you come back out  you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes  so that no one knows how you voted. Well  what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that  after you drop your vote into the ballot box. And most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted  because they trust that the election system works. They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly. The ballot boxes go to counting places. They're unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted. Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote  and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election. So we have to trust a lot of people. We have to trust a lot of procedures. And sometimes we even have to trust computers. So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes  all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines  and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better. Well in the face of all these bad headlines  researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture. And the big picture is this  elections should be verifiable. Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly  without breaking election secrecy  which is so very important. And that's the tough part. How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret  Well  the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them. And the secret is the ballot form. And if you look closely at these ballot forms  you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one. And that means  if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list  I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for. And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this  D barcode on the right. And there's some complicated cryptography going on in there  but what's not complicated is voting with one of these forms. So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us  and then we'll use the paper for verification. So this is how you vote. You get one of these ballot forms at random  and then you go into the voting booth  and you mark your choices  and you tear along a perforation. And you shred the candidate list. And the bit that remains  the one with your marks    this is your encrypted vote. So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote. And because it's encrypted  it can be submitted  stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see  including you. So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt. And after the close of the election  you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website. And remember  the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth  so if an election official wants to find out how you voted  they will not be able to. If the government wants to find out how you voted  they won't be able to. No hacker can break in and find out how you voted. No hacker can break in and change your vote  because then it won't match your receipt. Votes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it. But the election magic doesn't stop there. Instead  we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves. They can check that all the votes were counted correctly. They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one. And these are elections by the people  for the people. So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections. Thank you. I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the     s  when I was seven or eight years old  watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on. Then after every episode  I had to go up to the bathtub and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain  because that's all there was to look at. And by the time I turned     I pursued a career in marine science  in exploration and diving  and lived in underwater habitats  like this one off the Florida Keys  for    days total. Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks  Brian. And I've dived in deep sea submersibles around the world. And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world  operated by the Japanese government. And Sylvia Earle and I were on an expedition in this submarine    years ago in Japan. And on my dive  I went down        feet  to an area that I thought would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor. But when I got there  I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris. And it was really a turning point in my life  where I started to realize that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration. I needed to put it into a context. I needed to head towards conservation goals. So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica. I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica. Ten years ago was a seminal trip  where we explored that big iceberg  B     the largest iceberg in history  that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. And we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg  such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around  so that  as the blood flowed through our kidneys  it would get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies. But after three trips to Antarctica  I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water. And that same year     years ago  I headed north to the Phoenix Islands. And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment. But before I do  I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment. You may have seen this in other forms  but the top line is the amount of protected area on land  globally  and it's about    percent. And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the     s and '  s  and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now. And that's probably because that's when everybody got aware of the environment and Earth Day and all the stuff that happened in the '  s with the Hippies and everything really did  I think  have an affect on global awareness. But the ocean protected area is basically flat line until right about now    it appears to be ticking up. And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean. I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like we can see what happens on land. But unfortunately  the ocean is opaque  and we can't see what's going on. And therefore we're way behind on protection. But scuba diving  submersibles and all the work that we're setting about to do here will help rectify that. So where are the Phoenix Islands  They were the world's largest marine protected area up until last week when the Chagos Archipelago was declared. It's in the mid Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere. If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands  it's five days from Fiji  it's five days from Hawaii  it's five days from Samoa. It's out in the middle of the Pacific  right around the Equator. I had never heard of the islands    years ago  nor the country  Kiribati  that owns them  till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji said   Greg  would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands  They've never been dived.  And I said   Yeah. But tell me where they are and the country that owns them.  So that's when I first learned of the Islands and had no idea what I was getting into. But I was in for the adventure. Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands protected area. It's a very deep water part of our planet. The average depths are about        ft. There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands  which are specifically part of the protected area. Seamounts are important for biodiversity. There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land. It's an interesting fact. And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts. So it's a deep    think about it in a big three dimensional space  very deep three dimensional space with herds of tuna  whales  all kinds of deep sea marine life like we've seen here before. That's the vessel that we took up there for these studies  early on  and that's what the Islands look like    you can see in the background. They're very low to the water  and they're all uninhabited  except one island has about    caretakers on it. And they've been uninhabited for most of time because even in the ancient days  these islands were too far away from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti for those ancient Polynesian mariners that were traversing the Pacific so widely. But we got up there  and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go   Okay  where are we going to dive  Let's try there   and then falling into the water. Both my personal and my professional life changed. Suddenly  I saw a world that I had never seen before in the ocean    schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface  coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful  large fish everywhere  manta rays. It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning    this is about       longnose parrotfish spawning at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands. You can see the fish are balled up and then there's a little cloudy area there where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction    events that the ocean is supposed to do  but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity. The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries  especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here. Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location. And sharks    we had sharks on our early dives  up to     sharks at once  which is an indication of a very  very healthy  very strong  system. So I thought the scenes of never ending wilderness would go on forever  but they did finally come to an end. And we explored the surface of the Islands as well    very important bird nesting site  some of the most important bird nesting sites in the Pacific  in the world. And we finished our trip. And that's the area again. You can see the Islands    there are eight islands    that pop out of the water. The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts. Remember  a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface. And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands  Where do these exist  Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati  and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific in three island groups. In the west we have the Gilbert Islands. In the center we have the Phoenix Islands  which is the subject that I'm talking about. And then over to the east we have the Line Islands. It's the largest atoll nation in the world. And they have about         people spread out over    islands. They control  .  million cubic miles of ocean  and that's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet. And when I was first going up there  I barely knew the name of this country    years ago  and people would ask me   Why are you going to this place called Kiribati   And it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed  and the reporter yells   Hey  Willy. Why do you rob banks   And he says   cause that's where all the money is.  And I would tell people   Why do I go to Kiribati  Because that's where all the ocean is.  They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the Central Pacific Ocean. They're also a country that is in dire danger. Sea levels are rising  and Kiribati  along with    other nations in the world  will be under water within    to     years due to climate change and the associated sea level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean. The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface. Some of the islands have already gone under water. And these nations are faced with a real problem. We as a world are faced with a problem. What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet  The president of the Maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently to highlight the dire straits of these countries. So it's something we need to focus on. But back to the Phoenix Islands  which is the subject of this Talk. After I got back  I said  okay  this is amazing  what we found. I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati  who are over in Tarawa  the westernmost group. So I started contacting them    because they had actually given me a permit to do this    and I said   I want to come up and tell you what we found.  And for some reason they didn't want me to come  or it was hard to find a time and a place  and it took a while  but finally they said   Okay  you can come. But if you come  you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar.  So I said   Okay  I'm happy to buy lunch. Just get whatever anybody wants.  So David Obura  a coral reef biologist  and I went to Tarawa  and we presented for two hours on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands. And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area. They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands. After the talk  the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me and he said   Greg  do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever come back and told us what they did   He said   We often issue these permits to do research in our waters  but usually we get a note two or three years later  or a reprint. But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did. And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today. And are you free for dinner   And I was free for dinner  and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati. And over the course of dinner  I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue    it's a very poor country    but it gains what revenue is has by selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters  because Kiribati does not have the capacity to take the fish itself. And the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives Kiribati five percent of the landed value. So if the United States removes a million dollars' worth of lobsters from a reef  Kiribati gets        dollars. And  you know  it didn't seem like a very good deal to me. So I asked the Minister over dinner  I said   Would you consider a situation where you would still get paid    we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is    but you leave fish and the sharks and the shrimp in the water   He stopped  and he said   Yes  we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem  and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license.  He coined the term  reverse fishing license.  So I said   Yes  a 'reverse fishing license.'  So we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point. I went back to the States and started looking around to see if I could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued  and it turned out there were none. There were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing. It had occurred on land  in rainforests of South America and Africa  where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down. And Conservation International had struck some of those deals. So I went to Conservation International and brought them in as a partner and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource  deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated  what the range of the fishes were  brought in a whole bunch of other partners    the government of Australia  the government of New Zealand  the World Bank. The Oak Foundation and National Geographic have been big funders of this as well. And we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees to this very poor country to keep the area intact. Halfway through this process  I met the president of Kiribati  President Anote Tong. He's a really important leader  a real visionary  forward thinking man  and he told me two things when I approached him. He said   Greg  there's two things I'd like you to do. One is  remember I'm a politician  so you've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea. Secondly  I'd like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency. I don't want to do something like this if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office.  So we had very strong leadership  very good vision and a lot of science  a lot of lawyers involved. Many  many steps were taken to pull this off. And it was primarily because Kiribati realized that this was in their own self interest to do this. They realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community. Then in       when this was all going full swing  a coral bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands. Here's this resource that we're looking to save  and it turns out it's the hottest heating event that we can find on record. The ocean heated up as it does sometimes  and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the Phoenix Islands for six months. It was over    degrees Celsius for six months and it basically killed    percent of the coral. So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting  but now it appeared to be dead  at least in the coral areas. Of course the deep sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine  but the coral  which everybody likes to look at  was in trouble. Well  the good news is it's recovered and recovering fast  faster than any reef we've seen. This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago when we returned to the Phoenix Islands and discovered that  because it is a protected area and has healthy fish populations that keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy  the coral is booming  is just booming back. It's almost like if a person has multiple diseases  it's hard to get well  you might die  but if you only have one disease to deal with  you can get better. And that's the story with climate change heating. It's the only threat  the only influence that the reef had to deal with. There was no fishing  there was no pollution  there was no coastal development  and the reef is on a full bore recovery. Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries    years ago when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner and said   Well  I think that the conservation community might embrace this idea  Minister.  He paused and put his hands together and said   Yes  Greg  but the devil will be in the details   he said. And it certainly was. The last    years have been detail after detail ranging from creating legislation to multiple research expeditions to communication plans  as I said  teams of lawyers  MOUs  creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board. And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment. Kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment. We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago. So it's a fully functional up and running entity that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country. And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license and pays the country for this. So it's a very solid  very well thought out  very well grounded system  and it was a bottom up system  and that was very important with this work  from the bottom up to secure this. So the conditions for success here are listed. You can read them yourselves. But I would say the most important one in my mind was working within the market forces of the situation. And that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self interest of Kiribati as well as the self interest of the world. And I'll leave you with one final slide  that is  how do we scale this up  How do we realize Sylvia's dream  Where eventually do we take this  Here's the Pacific with large MPAs and large conservation zones on it. And as you can see  we have a patchwork across this ocean. I've just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle  the Phoenix Islands  but every other green patch on that has its own story. And what we need to do now is look at the whole Pacific Ocean in its entirety and make a network of MPAs across the Pacific so that we have our world's largest ocean protected and self sustaining over time. Thank you very much.  Applause  I have a doppelganger. Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the  Dragonball Z  Android Saga.  If you look very carefully  you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light. That's exactly what I do    optical mind control. But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination  my motives are not sinister. I control the brain in order to understand how it works. Now wait a minute  you may say  how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first  Isn't that putting the cart before the horse  Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis. They say   If we could record the activity of our neurons  we would understand the brain.  But think for a moment what that means. Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times  we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns  and that's so difficult  chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. Take a look at what brain activity might look like. In this simulation  each black dot is one nerve cell. The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. There's        neurons here. So you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. Your brains are about     million times more complicated. Somewhere  in a pattern like this  is you  your perceptions  your emotions  your memories  your plans for the future. But we don't know where  since we don't know how to read the pattern. We don't understand the code used by the brain. To make progress  we need to break the code. But how  An experienced code breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean  it's essential to be able to play with them  to rearrange them at will. So in this situation too  to decode the information contained in patterns like this  watching alone won't do. We need to rearrange the pattern. In other words  instead of recording the activity of neurons  we need to control it. It's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain  just some. The more targeted our interventions  the better. And I'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision. And since I'm realistic  rather than grandiose  I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries. But we'll certainly learn a lot. Now  I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. It dates back at least     years  to Galvani's famous experiments in the late   th century and beyond. Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. This experiment revealed the first  and perhaps most fundamental  nugget of the neural code  that information is written in the form of electrical impulses. Galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state of the art until today  despite a number of drawbacks. Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. It's hard to do in animals that run around  and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously. So around the turn of the last century  I started to think   Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down   So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain  re engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. Such an approach would literally  in a flash of light  overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. First  it's clearly a non invasive  wireless form of communication. And second  just as in a radio broadcast  you can communicate with many receivers at once. You don't need to know where these receivers are  and it doesn't matter if these receivers move    just think of the stereo in your car. It gets even better  for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in DNA. So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function. I hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept. There's no high tech gizmos here  just biology revealed through biology. Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close. As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons  we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores. Pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system. But these pores here are special. They are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes. Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor  the pore opens  an electrical current is switched on  and the neuron fires electrical impulses. Because the light activated pore is encoded in DNA  we can achieve incredible precision. This is because  although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes  different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells. You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light activated pore and others don't. So in this cartoon  the bluish white cell in the upper left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light activated pore. The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. In this example  each electrical impulse  each deflection on the trace  is caused by a brief pulse of light. And the approach  of course  also works in moving  behaving animals. This is the first ever such experiment  sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's. It was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student  Susana Lima. Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the         cells in its brain expressed the light activated pore. You're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly. They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position. And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect. The animal jumps  it spreads its wings  it vibrates them  but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates. Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see  Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. She cut the heads off of her flies. These headless bodies can live for about a day  but they don't do much. They just stand around and groom excessively. So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity. Anyway  as you'll see in a moment  Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away. They didn't get very far  obviously. Since we took these first steps  the field of optogenetics has exploded. And there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches. And we've come a long way since Galvani's and Susana's first successes in making animals twitch or jump. We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways  as I'll show you in my last example  which is directed at a familiar question. Life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next. We cope with this pressure by having brains  and within our brains  decision making centers that I've called here the  Actor.  The Actor implements a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we operate. Our actions change the environment  or context  and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop. Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model  we constructed a simple one dimensional world for our favorite subject  fruit flies. Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly. The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors  and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them. Here's some such CCTV footage. Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet  it has to make a decision. It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor  or whether to cross the midline and try something new. These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor's policy. Now for an intelligent being like our fly  this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience. We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly's brain contains not only an Actor  but a different group of cells  a  Critic   that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices. You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church  if you're an Austrian like me  or the super ego  if you're Freudian  or your mother  if you're Jewish. Now obviously  the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent. So we set out to identify the cells in the fly's brain that played the role of the Critic. And the logic of our experiment was simple. We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic  we should be able  artificially  to nag the Actor into changing its policy. In other words  the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but  in reality  it had not made. So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable. And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices. And whenever they made one of the two choices  chose one odor  in this case the blue one over the orange one  we switched on the lights. If the Critic was among the optically activated cells  the result of this intervention should be a change in policy. The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. Here's what happened in two instances  We're comparing two strains of flies  each of them having about     light addressable cells in their brains  shown here in green on the left and on the right. What's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. But the identities of the individual dopamine producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right. Optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences. If you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right  you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet  it marches straight through  as it did before. Its behavior is completely unchanged. But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different. Whenever it comes up to the midpoint  it pauses  it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment  and then it turns around. This means that the policy that the Actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber. This means that the Critic must have spoken in that animal  and that the Critic must be contained among the dopamine producing neurons on the left  but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right. Through many such experiments  we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just    cells. These    cells  as shown here in green  send the output to a brain structure called the  mushroom body   which is shown here in gray. We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. So this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice. Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies  this makes perfect sense. In fact  it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly. In this electronic toy circuit  the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue LEDs in the center of the board. These LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. Each odor activates a different combination of sensors  which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body. So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly  the Actor  can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy  which is stored in the strengths of the connection  between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions. If the connection is weak  the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course. If the connection is strong  the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn. Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off  the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped. In a situation like this  we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy. We have created such a situation  artificially  by turning on the critic with a flash of light. That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again  the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver. I don't know about you  but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical  mechanistic understanding of the mind  even if it's the mind of the fly. This is one piece of good news. The other piece of good news  for a scientist at least  is that much remains to be discovered. In the experiments I told you about  we have lifted the identity of the Critic  but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job. Come to think of it  knowing when you're wrong without a teacher  or your mother  telling you  is a very hard problem. There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done  but we still haven't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter. I think we'll get there in the not too distant future. Thank you. Well  there's lots to talk about  but I think I'm just going to play to start off.   When I wake up     in the morning     I pour the coffee     I read the paper     And then I slowly     and so softly     do the dishes     So feed the fishes     You sing me happy birthday     Like it's gonna be     your last day     here on Earth   All right. So  I wanted to do something special today. I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience  especially when it's half finished. I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it. Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. And so this is basically a song about loops  but not the kind of loops that I make up here. They're feedback loops. And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source  and then it gets in this self destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. And I'm going to demonstrate for you. I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.   This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a     Feedback  All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate       but my point is it's the sound of self destruction. And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms  from  say  the ecological  okay. There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from  it gets ugly. So like  you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease  and inbreeding and incest and  let's see  what's the other one  Biological    there's autoimmune diseases  where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host  or the person. And then    okay  this is where we get to the song    kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. Because although I've used scientific terms in songs  it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. And so  I don't know if you've ever had this  but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep  I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. That's what it feels like to me. It's not pleasant. I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. It's impossible  of course  for your eyes to see themselves  but they seem to be trying. So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. Or ears being able to hear themselves    it's just impossible. That's the thing. So  I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves  if that's possible. And that's what the song is asking. All right. It doesn't have a name yet.   Go ahead and congratulate yourself     Give yourself a hand  the hand is your hand     And the eye that eyes itself is your eye     And the ear that hears itself is near     'Cause it's your ear  oh oh     You've done the impossible now     Took yourself apart     You made yourself invulnerable     No one can break your heart     So you wear it out     And you wring it out     And you wear it out     And you break it yourself     Breaking your own  break it yourself     Breaking your own  break it yourself     Breaking your own   Thanks. All right. It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder. You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. But  you know  I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now  just a little bit. I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called  Weather Systems.    Quiet     Quiet down  she said     Speak into the back of his head     On the edge of the bed  I can see your blood flow     I can see your     cells grow     Hold still awhile     Don't spill the wine     I can see it all from here     I can see     oh  I     I can see     weather systems     of the world     Weather systems     of the world     Some things you say     are not for sale     I would hold it where     our free agents of some substance are     scared     Hold still a while     Don't spill the wine     I can see it all from here     I can see     oh  I     I can see     weather systems of the world     Weather systems     of the world   Thanks. So this is a story of a place that I now call home. It's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both. So this is Bertie County  North Carolina  USA. To give you an idea of the  where   So here's North Carolina  and if we zoom in  Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state. It's about two hours east driving time from Raleigh. And it's very flat. It's very swampy. It's mostly farmland. The entire county is home to just        people  and they're very sparsely distributed. So there's only    people per square mile  which comes down to about    people per square kilometer. Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America. We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders. We know the symptoms. It's the hollowing out of small towns. It's downtowns becoming ghost towns. The brain drain    where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back. It's the dependence on farm subsidies and under performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban. And Bertie County is no exception to this. Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with  like many communities similar to it  is that there's no shared  collective investment in the future of rural communities. Only  .  percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now benefits rural communities  and yet    percent of our population lives there. So Bertie County is not only very rural  it's incredibly poor. It is the poorest county in the state. It has one in three of its children living in poverty  and it's what is referred to as a  rural ghetto.  The economy is mostly agricultural. The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco  and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut. The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. The county seat is Windsor. This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now. It's home to only       people  and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years. There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use. You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand    Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite. But in the whole county there is no coffee shop  there's no Internet cafe  there's no movie theater  there's no bookstore. There isn't even a Walmart. Racially  the county is about    percent African American  but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy. So the public school students are about    percent African American. And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class  and you can see the difference is pretty stark. So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement. There's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from  and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher. So there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education. In fact  two years ago  only    percent of all the third  through eighth graders were passing the state standard in both English and math. So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place  but I promise there is good news. The biggest asset  in my opinion  one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man  This is Dr. Chip Zullinger  fondly known as Dr. Z. He was brought in in October      as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system. And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston  South Carolina and then in Denver  Colorado. He started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '  s in the U.S. And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary  and he is the reason that I now live and work there. So in February of       Dr. Zullinger invited us  Project H Design    which is a non profit design firm that I founded    to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district. And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process    one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital. Specifically  we use these six design directives  probably the most important being number two  we design with  not for    in that  when we're doing humanitarian focused design  it's not about designing for clients anymore. It's about designing with people  and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within. So at the time of being invited down there  we were based in San Francisco  and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of       spending about half our time in Bertie County. And when I say we  I mean Project H  but more specifically  I mean myself and my partner  Matthew Miller  who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver type builder. So fast forward to today  and we now live there. I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo  because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits. But this is our front porch. We live there. We now call this place home. Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth  we realized we had fallen in love with the place. We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County  that  as designers and builders  you can't do everywhere. There's space to experiment and to weld and to test things. We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger. There's a nobility of real  hands on  dirt under your fingernails work. But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there  there is a huge need. There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County. There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county. And so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool  something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have  and to be sort of the    to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit. The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger    that was why we were there. But beyond that  we recognized that Bertie County  as a community  was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking. So the goal became  yes  to apply design within education  but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development. So in order to do this  we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education. And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County  but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond. So the first of the three is design for education. This is the most kind of direct  obvious intersection of the two things. It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students. This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days. And so this played out for us in a couple different ways. The first was a series of renovations of computer labs. So traditionally  the computer labs  particularly in an under performing school like Bertie County  where they have to benchmark test every other week  the computer lab is a kill and drill testing facility. You come in  you face the wall  you take your test and you leave. So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology  to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging  more accessible  and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology based instruction. So this is the lab at the high school  and the principal there is in love with this room. Every time he has visitors  it's the first place that he takes them. And this also meant the co creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape. It allows elementary level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid. So this game that the kids are playing here    in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me. And in Match Me  you take the class  divide it into two teams  one team on each side of the playground  and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. And then she'll call out a math problem    so let's say four times four    and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is    and find the tire with the    on it and sit on it. So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing. Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores  a greater comfort level with the material  especially with the boys  that in going outside and playing  they aren't afraid to take on a double digit multiplication problem    and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material. So with design for education  I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers  so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them. So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent. He came out for one of our teacher training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself. So the second approach is redesigning education itself. This is the most complex. It's a systems level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom. So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change  which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside the box education systems in rural communities. So for us  this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie. There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county. And this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system. Right now I should say  there are only    percent of the houses that actually have an in home Internet connection. And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings  or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint  which I find myself squatting outside of a lot. Aside from  you know  getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place  it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community. It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development. So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer  and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day. And then the third approach  which is what I'm most excited about  which is where we are now  is  design as education. So  design as education  means that we could actually teach design within public schools  and not design based learning    not like  let's learn physics by building a rocket   but actually learning design thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose. It also means that designers are no longer consultants  but we're teachers  and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation. And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring  rigid  verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by. It's hands on  it's in your face  it requires an active engagement  and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways. So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class    wood and metal shop class in particular    historically  has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college. It's a vocational training path. It's working class  it's blue collar. The projects are things like  let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. And in recent decades  a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely. So we thought  what if you could bring back shop class  but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed  and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative design thinking studio process. So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class. And so this starts in four weeks  at the end of the summer  and my partner and I  Matthew and I  just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it. And this is what it looks like. So over the course of two semesters  the Fall and the Spring  the students spend three hours a day every single day in our       square foot studio shop space. And during that time  they're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need finding  coming back into the studio  doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work  and then moving into the shop and actually testing them  building them  prototyping them  figuring out if they are going to work and refining that. And then over the summer  they're offered a summer job. They're paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community. So the first project  which will be built next summer  is an open air farmers' market downtown  followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. So these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say   I built that  and I'm proud of it.  So I want you to meet three of our students. This is Ryan. She is    years old. She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher. She wants to go to college  but she wants to come back to Bertie County  because that's where her family is from  where she calls home  and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in. So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way. This is Eric. He plays for the football team. He is really into dirtbike racing  and he wants to be an architect. So for him  Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect  everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client. And then this is Anthony. He is    years old  loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands  and so for him  Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands on engagement. He's interested in forestry  but he isn't sure  so if he ends up not going to college  he will have developed some industry relevant skills. What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom. So this building downtown  which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market  is now the classroom. And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why    that's a homework assignment. And the ribbon cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public    that's the final exam. And for the community  what design and building offers is real  visible  built progress. It's one project per year  and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future. So we recognize that Studio H  especially in its first year  is a small story       students  it's two teachers  it's one project in one place. But we feel like this could work in other places. And I really  strongly believe in the power of the small story  because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale. Because  when you zoom out that far  you lose the ability to view people as humans. Ultimately  design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers. And let's face it  designers  we need to reinvent ourselves. We need to re educate ourselves around the things that matter  we need to work outside of our comfort zones more  and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard. So while this is a very small story  we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design. Thank you. Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war. These are not normally the most cheerful of topics  nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. Yet  not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago  but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict. Three things stand out  leadership  diplomacy and institutional design. What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter  how they matter  and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways  that is  how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. But let's start at the beginning. Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now  and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat. For nearly two decades now  the news has been bad and the images have been haunting. In Georgia  after years of stalemate  we saw a full scale resurgence of violence in August      . This quickly escalated into a five day war between Russia and Georgia  leaving Georgia ever more divided. In Kenya  contested presidential elections in         we just heard about them    quickly led to high levels of inter ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people. In Sri Lanka  a decades long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in       after perhaps as many as         people had been killed since     . In Kyrgyzstan  just over the last few weeks  unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. Hundreds have been killed  and more than         displaced  including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan. In the Middle East  conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated  and it becomes ever more difficult to see how  just how a possible  sustainable solution can be achieved. Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines  but the killing and displacement there continues as well  and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. And in Iraq  finally  violence is on the rise again  and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections. But hang on  this talk is to be about the good news. So are these now the images of the past  Well  notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East  Darfur  Iraq  elsewhere  there is a longer term trend that does represent some good news. Over the past two decades  since the end of the Cold War  there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars. Since the high in the early     s  with about    such civil wars ongoing  we now have    percent fewer such conflicts today. The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. But this trend is less unambiguous. The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between      and       with about        soldiers  policemen and rebels killed every year. The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in       with just        killed. Despite the up and down since then  the overall trend    and this is the important bit    clearly points downward for the past two decades. The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. From over        civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in      and       a decade later  this figure stands at      . This is a decrease by two thirds. This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in     . But then         civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war  from hunger or disease  for example. And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally. Torture  rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective  if often non lethal  weapons in civil war. To put it differently  for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war  there is no good war and there is no bad peace. Thus  even though every civilian killed  maimed  raped  or tortured is one too many  the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago  is good news. So  we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed. And the big question  of course  is why  In some cases  there is a military victory of one side. This is a solution of sorts  but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this  but we have seen similar so called military solutions in the Balkans  in the South Caucasus and across most of Africa. At times  they are complimented by negotiated settlements  or at least cease fire agreements  and peacekeepers are deployed. But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success    Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. But for many parts of Africa  a colleague of mine once put it this way   The cease fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning.  But let's look at the good news again. If there's no solution on the battlefield  three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war  or for sustainable peace afterwards  leadership  diplomacy and institutional design. Take the example of Northern Ireland. Despite centuries of animosity  decades of violence and thousands of people killed       saw the conclusion of an historic agreement. Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. Crucially  for the long term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland  he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations. Central among them  a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments  who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. The core institutions that were put in place in      and their modifications in      and      were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. The agreement combines a power sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so called Irish dimension of the conflict. And significantly  there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. The provisions in the agreement may be complex  but so is the underlying conflict. Perhaps most importantly  local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise  not always fast and not always enthusiastically  but rise in the end they did. Who ever could have imagined Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness jointly governing Northern Ireland as First and Deputy First Minister  But then  is Northern Ireland a unique example  or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries  By no means. The ending of Liberia's long lasting civil war in      illustrates the importance of leadership  diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full scale civil war in Macedonia in       or the successful ending of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in     . In all three cases  local leaders were willing and able to make peace  the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement  and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed. Focusing on leadership  diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace  or to make it last. The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements. Rather  local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. Yet instead of grasping this opportunity  local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada  the events of      and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in      turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged  and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full scale return to war between north and south. Changes and shortcomings in leadership  more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure. Unresolved boundary issues  squabbles over oil revenues  the ongoing conflict in Darfur  escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country. A final example  Kosovo. The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence  tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many  many different factors. Central among them are three. First  the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. Second  an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence. And third  a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. By the same token    and here we have some good news again    the very fact that there is a high level  well resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint  explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since     . So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal  local leaders and international leaders have a choice  and they can make a difference for the better. A cold war is not as good as a cold peace  but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. Good news is also about learning the right lesson. So what then distinguishes the Israeli Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland  or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia  Both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue. First  leadership. In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man made disasters  their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. Leadership needs to be capable  determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers  and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future. Second  diplomacy. Diplomacy needs to be well resourced  sustained  and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise  and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local  regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement. Third  institutional design. Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues  innovative thinking and flexible and well funded implementation. Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them. Conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls. For me personally  the most critical lesson of all is this  Local commitment to peace is all important  but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. Yet  no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. Therefore  we must invest in developing leaders  leaders that have the skills  vision and determination to make peace. Leaders  in other words  that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices. A final thought  Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers  frustrations and setbacks. It often takes a generation to accomplish  but it also requires us  today's generation  to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership  diplomacy and institutional design  so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow. Thank you. I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota. Many of you may have heard of the Lakota  or at least the larger group of tribes called the Sioux. The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations. The Pine Ridge Reservation  the subject of today's slide show  is located about    miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota. It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number      and it is where the Lakota now live. Now  if any of you have ever heard of AIM  the American Indian Movement  or of Russell Means  or Leonard Peltier  or of the stand off at Oglala  then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the U.S. So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota  and that's a very difficult one for me. Because  if you haven't noticed from my skin color  I'm white  and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation. You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today  and I've become very close with them  and they've welcomed me like family. They've called me  brother  and  uncle  and invited me again and again over five years. But on Pine Ridge  I will always be what is called  wasichu   and  wasichu  is a Lakota word that means  non Indian   but another version of this word means  the one who takes the best meat for himself.  And that's what I want to focus on    the one who takes the best part of the meat. It means greedy. So take a look around this auditorium today. We are at a private school in the American West  sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets. And if we look at our lives  we have indeed taken the best part of the meat. So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain  and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images of the Lakota  they stand for all indigenous people. On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family. The following is a time line of treaties made  treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles. I'll begin in     . What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department  setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans.       The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made  clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. According to the treaty  those lands are a sovereign nation. If the boundaries of this treaty had held    and there is a legal basis that they should    then this is what the U.S. would look like today.    years later  the Homestead Act  signed by President Lincoln  unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands.       An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of    Sioux men  the largest mass execution in U.S. history. The execution was ordered by President Lincoln only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.       the beginning of the transcontinental railroad    a new era. We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation. The treaties were out the window. In response  three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S. army many times over. I want to repeat that part. The Lakota defeat the U.S. army.       The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills. The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states. We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites. The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux. In fact  this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy.       The transcontinental railroad was completed. It began carrying  among other things  a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo  eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the Sioux.       The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government. In addition  the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations. All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war. Also in       we ended the time of treaty making. The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations  and we can't have that. We had plans.       General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory  specifically the Black Hills. The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation. Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible.       The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty.       On July   th on its way to attack a Lakota village  Custer's  th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn.       The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson. He was later killed while in custody.      is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as  sell or starve   Sign the paper  or no food for your tribe. Only    percent of the adult male population signed. The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three quarters of the tribe to sign away land. That clause was obviously ignored.       The Dawes Act. Communal ownership of reservation lands ends. Reservations are cut up into     acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. Tribes lost millions of acres. The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left. The move destroyed the reservations  making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation. Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers. Once again  the fat of the land goes to wasichu.       a date I believe to be the most important in this slide show. This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. On December   th  U.S. troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Big Foot and     prisoners of war  using a new rapid fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a Hotchkiss gun. For this so called  battle      Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the  th Cavalry. To this day  this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle. More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One  World War Two  Korea  Vietnam  Iraq or Afghanistan. The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars. Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee  I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux  but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. The holy man  Black Elk  said   I did not know then how much was ended. When I look back now from this high hill of my old age  I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard  A people's dream died there  and it was a beautiful dream.  With this event  a new era in Native American history began. Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after. Because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns that the U.S. government openly declared its position on Native rights. They were tired of treaties. They were tired of sacred hills. They were tired of ghost dances. And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. So they brought out their cannons.  You want to be an Indian now   they said  finger on the trigger.       the U.S. Indian population reached its low point    less than          compared to an estimated eight million in     . Fast forward.       The longest running court case in U.S. history  the Sioux Nation v. the United States  was ruled upon by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court determined that  when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders  the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated. The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the Sioux Nation. As payment for the Black Hills  the court awarded only     million dollars to the Sioux Nation. The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry   The Black Hills are not for sale.        Statistics about Native population today  more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee  reveal the legacy of colonization  forced migration and treaty violations. Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between    and    percent. The housing office is unable to build new structures  and existing structures are falling apart. Many are homeless  and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families.    percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. At least    percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold. More than    percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line. The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the U.S. national average. The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the U.S. national average. Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U.S. national average. School dropout rate is up to    percent. Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the U.S. national average. Frequently  grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents  due to alcoholism  domestic violence and general apathy  cannot raise them.    percent of the population over the age of    suffers from diabetes. The life expectancy for men is between    and    years old    roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia. The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say   My God  what are these people doing to themselves  They're killing each other. They're killing themselves while we watch them die.  This is how we came to own these United States. This is the legacy of manifest destiny. Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps long after the guards are gone. These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. A long time ago  a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me  by wasichu  eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills. Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end. As removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in       or a series of broken treaties     years ago  I still have to ask you the question  how should you feel about the statistics of today  What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you  And how much of this history do you need to own  even  Is any of this your responsibility today  I have been told that there must be something we can do. There must be some call to action. Because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness  just taking photographs. Because the solution seems so far in the past  I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them. The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix. It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti  or ending AIDS  or fighting a famine. The  fix   as it's called  may be much more difficult for the dominant society than  say  a     check or a church trip to paint some graffiti covered houses  or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. So where does that leave us  Shrugging our shoulders in the dark  The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the      and      Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota. The call to action I offer today    my TED wish    is this  Honor the treaties. Give back the Black Hills. It's not your business what they do with them. This cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the Eastern Congo. It's mined by armed gangs using slaves  child slaves  what the U.N. Security Council calls  blood minerals   then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in Shinjin in China. That factory    over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year. One man died after working a    hour shift. We all love chocolate. We buy it for our kids. Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children. Cote d'Ivoire  we have a huge problem of child slaves. Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations. Heparin    a blood thinner  a pharmaceutical product    starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China  because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines. Your diamond    you've all heard  probably seen the movie  Blood Diamond.  This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now. Cotton  Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth. Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest  the government shuts down the schools  puts the kids in buses  buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton. It's forced child labor on an institutional scale. And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila. These places  these origins  represent governance gaps. That's the politest description I have for them. These are the dark pools where global supply chains begin    the global supply chains  which bring us our favorite brand name products. Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states. Some of them are not states anymore at all. They're failed states. Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment  promote trade. Either way  they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma. I know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse in a global supply chain. But right now  most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future  nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product. Now  I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain. We need a reality check. We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have. This is an independent republic  probably a failed state. It's definitely not a democratic state. And right now  that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us  that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption. Now  that's not a new story. You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world  even in developed countries. You want to see the classic sweatshop  meet me at Madison Square Garden  I'll take you down the street  and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop. But take the example of heparin. It's a pharmaceutical product. You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital  probably squeaky clean. The problem is that the active ingredient in there    as I mentioned earlier    comes from pigs. The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs. And their factory in China    which probably is pretty clean    is getting all of the ingredients from backyard abattoirs  where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient. So a couple of years ago  we had a scandal which killed about    people around the world  because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain. Worse  some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in tests. This substitute cost nine dollars a pound  whereas real heparin  the real ingredient  cost     dollars a pound. A no brainer. The problem was that it killed more people. And so you're asking yourself   How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed this to happen  How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen   And the answer is quite simple  the Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities  not pharmaceutical facilities  so they don't audit them. And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem. This is offshore. They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas    about a dozen a year    maybe    in a good year. There are     of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone. In fact  about    percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore  particularly China and India  and we don't have a governance system. We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe. We don't have a system to ensure that human rights  basic dignity  are ensured. So at a national level    and we work in about    different countries    at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil. And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational. So governments who are failing  who are dropping the ball at a national level  have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level. And you can just look at the headlines. Take Copenhagen last year    complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge. Take the G   meeting a couple of weeks ago    stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago. You can take any one of the major global challenges we've discussed this week and ask yourself  where is the leadership from governments to step up and come up with solutions  responses  to those international problems  And the simple answer is they can't. They're national. Their voters are local. They have parochial interests. They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good. So  if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level    in this case  in the global supply chain    we have to come up with a different mechanism. We need a different machine. Fortunately  we have some examples. In the     s  there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S.    child labor  forced labor  serious health and safety abuses. And eventually President Clinton  in       convened a meeting at the White House  invited industry  human rights NGOs  trade unions  the Department of Labor  got them all in a room and said   Look  I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom. I don't know how to prevent that  but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response.  So they formed a White House task force  and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain. Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility. They don't own those facilities. They don't employ those workers. They're not legally liable. Everybody else at the table said   Folks  that doesn't cut it. You have a custodial duty  a duty of care  to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it  without fear of our safety  or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product.  So they agreed   Okay  what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards  code of conduct. We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control. We'll make it part of the contract.  And that was a stroke of absolute genius  because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract  private power  to deliver public goods. And let's face it  the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local labor law  the local environmental regulations  the local human rights standards. Those factories will probably never see an inspector. If the inspector did come along  it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe. Even if they did their jobs  and they cited those facilities for their violations  the fine would be derisory. But you lose that contract for a major brand name  that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt. That makes a difference. So what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain  that of the multinational company  and get them to do the right thing  get them to use that power for good  to deliver the key public goods. Now of course  this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies. They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money. But they are extremely efficient organizations. They have resources  and if we can add the will  the commitment  they know how to deliver that product. Now  getting there is not easy. Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier  they're not there. You need a safe space. You need a place where people can come together  sit down without fear of judgment  without recrimination  to actually face the problem  agree on the problem and come up with solutions. We can do it. The technical solutions are there. The problem is the lack of trust  the lack of confidence  the lack of partnership between NGOs  campaign groups  civil society organizations and multinational companies. If we can put those two together in a safe space  get them to work together  we can deliver public goods right now  or in extremely short supply. This is a radical proposition  and it's crazy to think that if you're a    year old Bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in Dhaka               dollars a month    your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract. It's crazy. Multinationals are protecting human rights. I know there's going to be disbelief. You'll say   How can we trust them   Well  we don't. It's the old arms control phrase   Trust  but verify.  So we audit. We take their supply chain  we take all the factory names  we do a random sample  we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities  and then we publish the results. Transparency is absolutely critical to this. You can call yourself responsible  but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work. So what we're doing is  we're not only enlisting the multinationals  we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good    respect for human rights    and we're checking. You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me. Go to the website. Look at the audit results. Ask yourself  is this company behaving in a socially responsible way  Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics  That's the way the system works. I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world. I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs. I've been at this for    years  and in that time I've seen the ability  the commitment  the will of government to do this decline  and I don't see them making a comeback right now. So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure. We're now thinking that  in fact  this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges. Call it network governance. Call it what you will. The private actors  companies and NGOs  are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face. Just look at pandemics    swine flu  bird flu  H N . Look at the health systems in so many countries. Do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic  No. Could the private sector and NGOs get together and marshal a response  Absolutely. What they lack is that safe space to come together  agree and move to action. That's what we're trying to provide. I know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume.  You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain. There are thousands of suppliers in there.  It seems too daunting  too dangerous  for any company to take on. But there are companies. We have       companies who are members. Some of them are very  very large companies. The sporting goods industry  in particular  stepped up to the plate and have done it. The example  the role model  is there. And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address    child labor in cottonseed farms in India    this year we will monitor        cottonseed farms in India. It seems overwhelming. The numbers just make you want to zone out. But we break it down to some basic realities. And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition  can I give this person their dignity back  Poor people  people whose human rights have been violated    the crux of that is the loss of dignity  the lack of dignity. It starts with just giving people back their dignity. I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon just next to Delhi  one of the flashiest  brightest new cities popping up in India right now  and I was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road  and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands. They didn't say money. They said   The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human  like we don't exist. Please ask them to treat us like human beings.  That's my simple understanding of human rights. That's my simple proposition to you  my simple plea to every decision maker in this room  everybody out there. We can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped. If we don't do it  we're abandoning hope  we're abandoning our essential humanity  and I know that's not a place we want to be  and we don't have to be there. So I appeal to you. Join us  come into that safe space  and let's start to make this happen. Thank you very much. Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem  Well  I hope to change that in less than three minutes. So  I hope to convince you that complex doesn't always equal complicated. So for me  a well crafted baguette  fresh out of the oven  is complex  but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated. I'm an ecologist  and I study complexity. I love complexity. And I study that in the natural world  the interconnectedness of species. So here's a food web  or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non native fish that never lived there before. All the grayed out species disappear. Some are actually on the brink of extinction. And lakes with fish have more mosquitos  even though they eat them. These effects were all unanticipated  and yet we're discovering they're predictable. So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems. First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. For example  you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem  or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. The next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another  if you focus only on that link  and then you black box the rest  it's actually less predictable than if you step back  consider the entire system    all the species  all the links    and from that place  hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most. And we're discovering  with our research  that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees. So the more you step back  embrace complexity  the better chance you have of finding simple answers  and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with. So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated. And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. Clearly a complex problem  but is it complicated  Well  when I saw this in the front page of the Times  I thought   Great. Finally something I can relate to. I can sink my teeth into this.  So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever  a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. The circled node is the one we're trying to influence    popular support for the government. And so now we can look one degrees  two degrees  three degrees away from that node and eliminate three quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence. Within that sphere  most of those nodes are not actionable  like the harshness of the terrain  and a very small minority are actual military actions. Most are non violent and they fall into two broad categories  active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair  transparent economic development and provisioning of services. I don't know about this  but this is what I can decipher from this diagram in    seconds. When you see a diagram like this  I don't want you to be afraid. I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved. Because simple answers may emerge. We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity. So for any problem  the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity  the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most. Thank you. We've got a real problem with math education right now. Basically  no one's very happy. Those learning it think it's disconnected  uninteresting and hard. Those trying to employ them think they don't know enough. Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies  but don't know how to fix it. And teachers are also frustrated. Yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history. So at one end we've got falling interest in education in math  and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world  a more quantitative world than we ever have had. So what's the problem  why has this chasm opened up  and what can we do to fix it  Well actually  I think the answer is staring us right in the face  Use computers. I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work. So to explain that  let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education. See  in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians. It's done by geologists  engineers  biologists  all sorts of different people    modeling and simulation. It's actually very popular. But in education it looks very different    dumbed down problems  lots of calculating  mostly by hand. Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world  except if you're learning it. And another thing about math  math sometimes looks like math    like in this example here    and sometimes it doesn't    like  Am I drunk   And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world. You wouldn't have expected that a few years back. But now you can find out all about    unfortunately  my weight is a little higher than that  but    all about what happens. So let's zoom out a bit and ask  why are we teaching people math  What's the point of teaching people math  And in particular  why are we teaching them math in general  Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject  Well  I think there are about three reasons  technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies  what I call  everyday living     to function in the world today  you've got to be pretty quantitative  much more so than a few years ago  figure out your mortgages  being skeptical of government statistics  those kinds of things    and thirdly  what I would call something like logical mind training  logical thinking. Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society. It's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that. So let's ask another question. What is math  What do we mean when we say we're doing math  or educating people to do math  Well  I think it's about four steps  roughly speaking  starting with posing the right question. What is it that we want to ask  What is it we're trying to find out here  And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world  beyond virtually any other part of doing math. People ask the wrong question  and surprisingly enough  they get the wrong answer  for that reason  if not for others. So the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem. That's stage two. Once you've done that  then there's the computation step. Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form. And of course  math is very powerful at doing that. And then finally  turn it back to the real world. Did it answer the question  And also verify it    crucial step. Now here's the crazy thing right now. In math education  we're spending about perhaps    percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand. Yet  that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice. Instead  we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one  two and four    conceptualizing problems  applying them  getting the teacher to run them through how to do that. See  crucial point here  math is not equal to calculating. Math is a much broader subject than calculating. Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years. There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand. But in the last few decades that has totally changed. We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers. Calculating was typically the limiting step  and now often it isn't. So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating. But that math liberation didn't get into education yet. See  I think of calculating  in a sense  as the machinery of math. It's the chore. It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can  like to get a machine to do. It's a means to an end  not an end in itself  and automation allows us to have that machinery. Computers allow us to do that    and this is not a small problem by any means. I estimated that  just today  across the world  we spent about     average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand. That's an amazing amount of human endeavor. So we better be damn sure    and by the way  they didn't even have fun doing it  most of them    so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose. I think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that. And I think there are some cases. For example  mental arithmetic. I still do a lot of that  mainly for estimating. People say   Is such and such true   And I'll say   Hmm  not sure.  I'll think about it roughly. It's still quicker to do that and more practical. So I think practicality is one case where it's worth teaching people by hand. And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating  but I think they're relatively small in number. One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates. See  the thing we're doing right now is we're forcing people to learn mathematics. It's a major subject. I'm not for one minute suggesting that  if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre    they should do that. That's absolutely the right thing  for people to follow their self interest. I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek  but I don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek. I don't think it's warranted. So I have this distinction between what we're making people do and the subject that's sort of mainstream and the subject that  in a sense  people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that. So what are the issues people bring up with this  Well one of them is  they say  you need to get the basics first. You shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject. So my usual question is  what do you mean by  basics   Basics of what  Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it  or design it for that matter  Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill  I don't think so. I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation. A hundred years ago  it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things. But automation in cars allowed that to separate  so driving is now a quite separate subject  so to speak  from engineering of the car or learning how to service it. So automation allows this separation and also allows    in the case of driving  and I believe also in the future case of maths    a democratized way of doing that. It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that. So there's another thing that comes up with basics. People confuse  in my view  the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching. So just because paper was invented before computers  it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics. My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this. She enjoys making what she calls  paper laptops.  So I asked her one day   You know  when I was your age  I didn't make these. Why do you think that was   And after a second or two  carefully reflecting  she said   No paper   If you were born after computers and paper  it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in  you just want to have the best tool. So another one that comes up is  Computers dumb math down.  That somehow  if you use a computer  it's all mindless button pushing  but if you do it by hand  it's all intellectual. This one kind of annoys me  I must say. Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand  for reasons they don't get  I don't think so. And what's worse  what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore. Might have been    years ago  but it isn't anymore. When they're out of education  they do it on a computer. Just to be clear  I think computers can really help with this problem  actually make it more conceptual. Now  of course  like any great tool  they can be used completely mindlessly  like turning everything into a multimedia show  like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand  where the computer was the teacher    show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand. This is just nuts. Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway  All backwards. Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. See  normally in school  you do things like solve quadratic equations. But you see  when you're using a computer  you can just substitute. You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder  calculating wise. Same principles applied    calculations  harder. And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this. They've got hair all over them. They're not just simple  dumbed down things that we see in school math. And think of the outside world. Do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers  I don't think so    quite the opposite. So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down  but that we have dumbed down problems right now. Well  another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding. So if you go through lots of examples  you can get the answer  you can understand how the basics of the system work better. I think there is one thing that I think very valid here  which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important. But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world. It's called programming. Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days  and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand. If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it. So programming is the way I think we should be doing that. So to be clear  what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual  simultaneously. I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible. It's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual. But I think we can do both at the same time here. And we open up so many more possibilities. You can do so many more problems. What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before. And experience of harder problems    being able to play with the math  interact with it  feel it. We want people who can feel the math instinctively. That's what computers allow us to do. Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum. Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate  but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts  however hard the calculating. So calculus has traditionally been taught very late. Why is this  Well  it's damn hard doing the calculations  that's the problem. But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group. This was an example I built for my daughter. And very  very simple. We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number. And of course  it turns into a circle. And by the way  she was also very insistent on being able to change the color  an important feature for this demonstration. You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme    and very small sides and a very large number of sides. Very simple example. That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many  many years after this. And yet  that's a really important practical view of the world. So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams. In the end  if we test everyone by hand in exams  it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters. And one of the reasons it's so important    so it's very important to get computers in exams. And then we can ask questions  real questions  questions like  what's the best life insurance policy to get     real questions that people have in their everyday lives. And you see  this isn't some dumbed down model here. This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens. How many years of protection do I need  What does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth  Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams  but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding. So I believe  there is  critical reform we have to do in computer based math. We have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward  and also our societies  based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics. This isn't some optional extra. And the country that does this first will  in my view  leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even  an improved economy  an improved outlook. In fact  I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the  knowledge economy  to what we might call a  computational knowledge economy   where high level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is. We can engage so many more students with this  and they can have a better time doing it. And let's understand  this is not an incremental sort of change. We're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real world math. And you know if you walk across a chasm  you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all    bigger disaster. No  what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off  we should increase our velocity so it's high  and we should leap off one side and go the other    of course  having calculated our differential equation very carefully. So I want to see a completely renewed  changed math curriculum built from the ground up  based on computers being there  computers that are now ubiquitous almost. Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years. Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math  but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future. Let's go for it  and while we're about it  let's have a bit of fun  for us  for the students and for TED here. Thanks. Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart  which is beauty. I do the philosophy of art  aesthetics  actually  for a living. I try to figure out intellectually  philosophically  psychologically  what the experience of beauty is  what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it. Now this is an extremely complicated subject  in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different. I mean just think of the sheer variety    a baby's face  Berlioz's  Harold in Italy   movies like  The Wizard of Oz  or the plays of Chekhov  a central California landscape  a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji   Der Rosenkavalier   a stunning match winning goal in a World Cup soccer match  Van Gogh's  Starry Night   a Jane Austen novel  Fred Astaire dancing across the screen. This brief list includes human beings  natural landforms  works of art and skilled human actions. An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy. I can  however  give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have. And we get it not from a philosopher of art  not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic. No  this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding  and you know who I mean  Charles Darwin. Of course  a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question   What is beauty   It's in the eye of the beholder. It's whatever moves you personally. Or  as some people  especially academics prefer  beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder. People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste. Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease. Beethoven is adored in Japan. Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints. Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums  while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth. Or just think about American jazz or American movies    they go everywhere. There are many differences among the arts  but there are also universal  cross cultural aesthetic pleasures and values. How can we explain this universality  The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes. We need to reverse engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric  largely pleistocene environments  where we became fully human  but also by the social situations in which we evolved. This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory. I mean fossils  cave paintings and so forth. And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter gatherer bands that survived into the   th and the   th centuries. Now  I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty  with its emotional intensity and pleasure  belongs to our evolved human psychology. The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations. Beauty is an adaptive effect  which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment. As many of you will know  evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms. The first of these is natural selection    that's random mutation and selective retention    along with our basic anatomy and physiology    the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails. Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions  such as the horrid smell of rotting meat  or fears  such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff. Natural selection also explains pleasures    sexual pleasure  our liking for sweet  fat and proteins  which in turn explains a lot of popular foods  from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs. The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection  and it operates very differently. The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this. It did not evolve for natural survival. In fact  it goes against natural survival. No  the peacock's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens. It's quite a familiar story. It's women who actually push history forward. Darwin himself  by the way  had no doubts that the peacock's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen. He actually used that word. Now  keeping these ideas firmly in mind  we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination  even obsession  in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction. Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance  so to speak. I mean  you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape. It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover. So evolution's trick is to make them beautiful  to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them. Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure  the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes. People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape  a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved. This landscape shows up today on calendars  on postcards  in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand. It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees. The trees  by the way  are often preferred if they fork near the ground  that is to say  if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix. The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view  or evidence of water in a bluish distance  indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally    get this    a path or a road  perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline  that extends into the distance  almost inviting you to follow it. This landscape type is regarded as beautiful  even by people in countries that don't have it. The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience. But  someone might argue  that's natural beauty. How about artistic beauty  Isn't that exhaustively cultural  No  I don't think it is. And once again  I'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it. It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet. Chauvet caves are about        years old  along with a few small  realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period. But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that. Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair  as well as ochre body paint  have been found from around         years ago. But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this. I have in mind the so called Acheulian hand axes. The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. They go back about two and a half million years. These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries  until around  .  million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single  thin stone blades  sometimes rounded ovals  but often in what are to our eyes an arresting  symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form. These Acheulian hand axes    they're named after St. Acheul in France  where finds were made in   th century    have been unearthed in their thousands  scattered across Asia  Europe and Africa  almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed. Now  the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals. And the plot really thickens when you realize that  unlike other pleistocene tools  the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges. And some  in any event  are too big to use for butchery. Their symmetry  their attractive materials and  above all  their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes  even today. So what were these ancient    I mean  they're ancient  they're foreign  but they're at the same time somehow familiar. What were these artifacts for  The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art  practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects  contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship. Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history    tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call  fitness signals     that is to say  displays that are performances like the peacock's tail  except that  unlike hair and feathers  the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted. Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities    intelligence  fine motor control  planning ability  conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials. Over tens of thousands of generations  such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable. You know  it's an old line  but it has been shown to work     Why don't you come up to my cave  so I can show you my hand axes   Except  of course  what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed  because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. It's hard to grasp  but it's an incredible fact. This object was made by a hominid ancestor  Homo erectus or Homo ergaster  between        and         years before language. Stretching over a million years  the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto human history. By the end of the hand axe epic  Homo sapiens    as they were then called  finally    were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by  who knows  telling jokes  storytelling  dancing  or hairstyling. Yes  hairstyling    I insist on that. For us moderns  virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies  to express intense emotions with music  painting and dance. But still  one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings  the beauty we find in skilled performances. From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall  human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts. We find beauty in something done well. So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone  don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful. Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it  even before they could put their love into words. Is beauty in the eye of the beholder  No  it's deep in our minds. It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors. Our powerful reaction to images  to the expression of emotion in art  to the beauty of music  to the night sky  will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists. Thank you. Mountain biking in Israel is something that I do with great passion and commitment. And when I'm on my bike  I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel  and I feel that I'm united with this country's history and biblical law. And also  for me  biking is a matter of empowerment. When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere  I feel young  invincible  eternal. It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself. You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture  looking at me with some concern. And here is another picture of them. Unfortunately  I cannot show their faces  neither can I disclose their true names  and that's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates  offenders spending time in a correction facility about    minutes' ride from here    well  like everything in Israel. And I've been riding with these kids once a week  every Tuesday  rain or shine  for the last four years and by now  they've become a very big part of my life. This story began four years ago. The correction facility where they are locked up happens to be right in the middle of one of my usual trips  and it's surrounded by barbed wires and electric gates and armed guards. So on one of these rides  I talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden. I told the warden that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically I wanted to take the kids from here to there. And I told him   Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out    kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country.  And the warden was quite amused  and he told me he thought that I was a nut and he told me   This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders. They are supposed to be locked up. They aren't supposed to be out at large.  And yet  we began to talk about it  and one thing led to another. And I can't see myself going into a state prison in New Jersey and making such a proposition  but this being Israel  the warden somehow made it happen. And so two months later  we found ourselves  at large     myself     juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ  who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project. And in the next few weeks  I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom  a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these    everything you see here is obviously in Israel    as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes  colors  shapes  forms and so on. In spite of all this splendor  the beginning was extremely frustrating. Every small obstacle  every slight uphill  would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up. So we had a lot of this going on. I found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties    not because they were physically unfit. But that's one reason why they ended up where they were. And I became increasingly more and more agitated  because I was there not only to be with them  but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do. Now  let me give you an example. We're going downhill in some rocky terrain  and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here. So he crashes down  and he gets slightly injured  but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently. Then he throws his helmet in the air. His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction. And then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and curse like I've never heard. And I'm just standing there  watching this scene with a complete disbelief  not knowing what to do. I'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students  and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging  violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere. And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations. They happened in places like this  in the Judean Desert     kilometers away from the nearest road. And what you don't see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there  there's a teenager sitting on a rock  saying   I'm not moving from here. Forget it. I've had it.  Well  that's a problem because one way or another  you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do. At the beginning  it was a disaster. I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere. That's what they had all their lives. And at some point I found out  when a kid like this gets into a fit  the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid  which is difficult  because what you really want to do is go away. But that's what he had all his life  people walking away from him. So what you have to do is stay close and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate. So I would say   Alex  I know that it's terribly difficult. Why don't you rest for a few minutes and then we'll go on.   Go away you maniac psychopath. Why would you bring us to this goddamn place   And I would say   Relax  Alex. Here's a piece of chocolate.  And Alex would go   Arrrrggg   Because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry    and after the rides also. And who is this guy  Alex  to begin with  He's a    year old. When he was eight  someone put him on a boat in Odessa and sent him  shipped him to Israel on his own. And he ended up in south Tel Aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a  unclear  and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member. And he spent the last    years of his life in two places only  the slums and the state prison  where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there. And so this kid was probably abused  abandoned  ignored  betrayed by almost every adult along the way. So  for such a kid  when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation  irrespective of how he behaves  it's a tremendous healing experience. It's an act of unconditional acceptance  something that he never had. I want to say a few words about vision. When I started this program four years ago  I had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs. I had an image of Lance Armstrong in my mind. And it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced  and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available. It all of a sudden dawned on me  in this project  that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only  love. Love to the country  to the uphill and the downhill  to all the incredible creatures that surround us    the animals  the plants  the insects    love and respect to other fellow members in your team  in your biking team  and most importantly  love and respect to yourself  which is something that they badly miss. Together with the kids  I also went through a remarkable transformation. Now  I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology. I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen. And before I worked with the kids  anything that I did with them  or anything that I did with myself  was supposed to be perfect  ideal  optimal  but after working with them for some time  I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision  and if the vision doesn't work  well nothing happened. All you have to do is play with it  change it a little bit  and come up with something that does help  that does work. So right now  I feel more like these are my principles  and if you don't like them  I have others. And one of these principles is focus. Before each ride we sit together with the kids  and we give them one word to think about during the ride. You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen. So these are words like  teamwork  or  endurance  or even complicated concepts like  resource allocation  or  perspective   a word that they don't understand. You know  perspective is one of these critically important life coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you. I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore  it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows. It literally propels you upwards. That's what perspective is all about. Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before. And that's how they develop self esteem. Now  let me give you an example of how it works. You stand with your bike at the beginning of February. It's very cold  and you're standing in one of these rainy days  and it's drizzling and cold and chilly  and you're standing in  let's say  Yokneam. And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka    that's where you're supposed to climb now    and you say   There's no way that I could possibly get there.  And yet  two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery  smeared with mud  blood and sweat. And you look down at Yokneam  everything is so small and tiny. And you say   Hey  Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started. It's that big. I can't believe that I did it.  And that's the point when you start loving yourself. And so we talked about these special words that we teach them. And at the end of each ride  we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference  and these discussions can be extremely inspiring. In one of them  one of the kids once said   When we were riding on this ridge overlooking the Dead Sea    and he's talking about this spot here     I was reminded of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia and went away together with my brother. We walked     kilometers until we reached Sudan. This was the first place where we got some water and supplies.  And he goes on saying  and everyone looks at him like a hero  probably for the first time in his life. And he says    because I also have volunteers riding with me  adults  who are sitting there listening to him    and he says   And this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in Israel. And only now   he says   I'm beginning to understand where I am  and I actually like it.  Now I remember  when he said it  I felt goosebumps on my body  because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background. That's where Joshua descended and crossed the Jordan and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan       years ago in this final leg of the journey from Africa. And so  perspective and context and history play key roles in the way I plan my rides with the kids. We visit Kibbutzim that were established by Holocaust survivors. We explore ruins of Palestinian villages  and we discuss how they became ruins. And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements  Nabatic settlements  Canaanite settlements    three   four  five thousand years old. And through this tapestry  which is the history of this country  the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education  and that is the understanding that life is complex  and there's no black and white. And by appreciating complexity  they become more tolerant  and tolerance leads to hope. I ride with these kids once a week  every Tuesday. Here's a picture I took last Tuesday    less than a week ago    and I ride with them tomorrow also. In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations  taking in this incredible landscape around me  and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive  and that I sense every fiber in my aching body. And I feel blessed and fortunate that    years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia. And I feel blessed and fortunate that every week  every Tuesday    and actually every Friday also    I can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in Israel on the edge. Thank you. I grew up in a very small village in Canada  and I'm an undiagnosed dyslexic. I had a really hard time in school. In fact  my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school. I ran away. I left when I was    years old to go to Bali  and there I met my incredible wife  Cynthia  and together  over    years  we built an amazing jewelry business. It was a fairy tale  and then we retired. Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see. It ruined my life     The Inconvenient Truth  and Mr. Gore. I have four kids  and even if part of what he says is true  they're not going to have the life that I had. And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities. So here's the world  and here we are in Bali. It's a tiny  little island       miles by    miles. It has an intact Hindu culture. Cynthia and I were there. We had had a wonderful life there  and we decided to do something unusual. We decided to give back locally. And here it is  it's called the Green School. I know it doesn't look like a school  but it is something we decided to do  and it is extremely  extremely green. The classrooms have no walls. The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard. The desks are not square. At Green School  the children are smiling    an unusual thing for school  especially for me. And we practice holism. And for me it's just the idea that  if this little girl graduates as a whole person  chances are she'll demand a whole world    a whole world    to live on. Our children spend     days going to school in a box. The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials. So if this gentleman had had a holistic education  would he be sitting there  Would he have had more possibilities in his life  The classrooms have natural light. They're beautiful. They're bamboo. The breeze passes through them. And when the natural breeze isn't enough  the kids deploy bubbles  but not the kind of bubbles you know. These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. So we basically turned the box into a bubble. And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future. We pay the bill at the end of the month  but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren. We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible. These kids did a little graffiti on their desks  and then they signed up for two extra courses. The first one was called sanding and the second one was called re waxing. But since that happened  they own those desks. They know they can control their world. We're on the grid. We're not proud of it. But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar. And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world  in a two and a half meter drop on a river. When the turbine drops in  it will produce       watts of electricity  day and night. And you know what these are. There's nowhere to flush. And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water    you're all really smart  just do the math. How many people times how much water. There isn't enough water. These are compost toilets  and nobody at the school wanted to know about them  especially the principal. And they work. People use them. People are okay. It's something you should think about doing. Not many things didn't work. The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months. We had to replace them with recyclable plastic. The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms. So we had some good ideas  we took old automobile windshields  put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard. Green School sits in south central Bali  and it's on    acres of rolling garden. There's an amazing river traveling through it  and you can see there how we manage to get across the river. I met a father the other day  he looked a little crazed. I said   Welcome to Green School.  He said   I've been on an airplane for    hours.  I asked him   Why   He said   I had a dream once about a green school  and I saw a picture of this green school  I got on an airplane. In August I'm bringing my sons.  This was a great thing. But more than that  people are building green houses around Green School  so their kids can walk to school on the paths. And people are bringing their green industries  hopefully their green restaurants  to the Green School. It's becoming a community. It's becoming a green model. We had to look at everything. No petrochemicals in the pavement. No pavement. These are volcanic stones laid by hand. There are no sidewalks. The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains  but they're green. This is the school buffalo. He's planning to eat that fence for dinner. All the fences at Green School are green. And when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate  they found out the fence was made out of tapioca. They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen  sliced them thinly and made delicious chips. Landscaping. We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms. We dropped them gently in. We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs. And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field. These young ladies are living in a rice culture  but they know something that few people know in a rice culture. They know how to plant organic rice  they know how to look after it  they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it. They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future. This young man is picking organic vegetables. We feed     people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas. Local Balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know. The food is incredible. Green School is a place of pioneers  local and global. And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world. The kids are from    countries. When I see them together  I know that they're working out how to live in the future. Green School is going into its third year with     children. It's a school where you do learn reading    one of my favorites    writing    I was bad at it    arithmetic. But you also learn other things. You learn bamboo building. You practice ancient Balinese arts. This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields. The kids love it. The mothers aren't quite convinced. We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives  and we said  okay  local  what does  local  mean  Local means that    percent of the population of the school has to be Balinese  and this was a really big commitment. And we were right. And people are coming forward from all over the world to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund  because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders. The teachers are as diverse as the student body  and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up. A man came from Java with a new kind of organic agriculture. A woman came from Africa with music. And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global  green leaders. The Green School effect    we don't know what it is. We need someone to come and study it. But what's happening  our learning different kids    dyslexic    we've renamed them prolexic    are doing well in these beautiful  beautiful classrooms. And all the kids are thriving. And how did we do all this  On giant grass. It's bamboo. It comes out of the ground like a train. It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this. It's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof. When the architects came  they brought us these things  and you've probably seen things like this. The yellow box was called the administration complex. We squashed it  we rethought it  but mainly we renamed it  the heart of school   and that changed everything forever. It's a double helix. It has administrators in it and many  many other things. And the problem of building it    when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans  they looked at them and said   What's this   So we built big models. We had them engineered by the engineers. And Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers  selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age old techniques  mostly by hand. It was chaos. And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do  so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down  we realized that we had a cathedral  a cathedral to green  and a cathedral to green education. The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it. From the time the foundations were finished  in three months it had roofs and floors. It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world  but many people believe that it's the most beautiful. Is this doable in your community  We believe it is. Green School is a model we built for the world. It's a model we built for Bali. And you just have to follow these simple  simple rules  be local  let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build. So  Mr. Gore  thank you. You ruined my life  but you gave me an incredible future. And if you're interested in being involved in finishing Green School and building the next    around the world  please come and see us. Thank you. Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep  so dark  so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon. It's a place of myth and legend. It's a place marked on ancient maps as  here be monsters.  It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed. Instead  they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep. We are talking about the high seas. The  high seas  is a legal term  but in fact  it covers    percent of the planet. With an average depth of the oceans of       meters  in fact  the high seas covers and provides nearly    percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. It is  in theory  the global commons  belonging to us all. But in reality  it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it. So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark. We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. And then finally  we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean basin wide conservation  but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect. So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above    that area in the darker blue. To me  as an international lawyer  this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen  for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean  the global ocean  that provides us all with carbon storage  with heat storage  with oxygen  if you can only protect    percent. This is indeed the true heart of the planet. Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws    for example  shipping    provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. For example  garbage discharge  something you would think just simply goes away  but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. As a result  we have garbage patches the size of twice Texas. It's unbelievable. We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution  but that has proved to be no longer the case. So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom  who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale  is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. And these include a sense of shared responsibility  common norms that bind people together as a community. Conditional access  You can invite people in  but they have to be able to play by the rules. And of course  if you want people to play by the rules  you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement  for as we've discovered  you can trust  but you also need to verify. What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas. For a group of very dedicated individuals    scientists  conservationists  photographers and states    were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you. That is  we're able to save it from a fate of deep sea bottom trawling. And how did we do that  Well  as I said  we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process. But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations  trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed. So within three years  from      to       we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep sea bottom trawling. Instead of  go anywhere  do anything you want   we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm. In       when the U.N. reviewed progress  they discovered that almost     million square kilometers of seabed had been protected. This does not mean that it's the final solution  or that this even provides permanent protection. But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed  to create a new regime. So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true  blue perspective for this beautiful planet. Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage  that access to the heart of human beings  you might say  who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes  but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life cycle of creatures like these sea turtles  who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas. Today  we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas  just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. The Sargasso Sea  for example  is not a sea bounded by coastlines  but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm  and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. But the Sargasso Sea  the same way it aggregates sargassum weed  actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region. This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show  because I haven't been out there myself. But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are         pieces of plastic per square kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea  and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food. The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs. But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection. Thus  the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction    but the vast majority is beyond    to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area. Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now  the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean. It's actually a bay. It's considered high seas  because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims. So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas. But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what  till recently  has been a virtually intact near shore ecosystem. But unfortunately  CCAMLR  the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources  is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region. The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales  who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. So what we need to do is to stand up boldly  singly and together  to push governments  to push regional fisheries management organizations  to declare our right to declare certain areas off limits to high seas fishing  so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime. Coming closer to here  the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area    potentially year round habitat for blue whales. There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long. But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is  in fact  it's not a permanent place. It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis. So  in fact  it's not permanently in the high seas. It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries  but it moves with the season. As such  it does create a challenge to protect  but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it. We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are  in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable  which may  in some cases  be year round. Getting closer to shore  where we are  this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. Many species are headed through this region  which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area. That is  it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative. It's protecting five World Heritage sites. Unfortunately  the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction  at present. So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention  so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites  or we need to change the name and call it Half the World Heritage Convention. But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre  where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this  or as bycatch. So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale up. We need to work locally  but we also need to work ocean basin wide. We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean basin wide initiative. We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project  one of the    Census of Marine Life projects. It's provided us data like this  of tiny  little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. They fly        kilometers in less than a year. So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October. So stay tuned for further information. What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators  it's also looked in the really unexplored mid water column  where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found. And fortunately  we've been able  as IUCN  to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers. We have the support of governments now behind us. We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots  hotspots. At the same time we're saying   Yes  we need more. We need to move forward.  But many of you have said  if you get these marine protected areas  or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place  how are you going to enforce it  Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science  which is outer space technology. I wanted to be an astronaut  so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space    and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about  in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life cycles in the open ocean. We can also tag and track fishing vessels. Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing. But not all the vessels have those to date. It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate  if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources  we need to know    someone needs to know    where you are and what you're doing. So it brings me to my main take home message  which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. We can stop the collision course of    percent of the planet with the high seas. But we need to think broad scale. We need to think globally. We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources. We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect. At the same time  we need to think locally  which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish  is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas  and to bring people to the table  if you will  to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management. And third is that we need to look at ocean basin wide management. Our species are ocean basin wide. Many of the deep sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean basin wide. We need to better understand  but we also need to start to manage and protect. And in order to do that  you also need ocean basin management regimes. That is  we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone  but we need to scale these up  we need to build their capacity  so they're like the Southern Ocean  where they do have the two pronged fisheries and conservation organization. So with that  I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish  for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote. So on this tour  I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas  one  that it is our home too  and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. Thank you. So  a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant  world class neuropsychologist  I had a baby. And that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant  world class neuropsychologist. Sorry  TED. But I did go on to be a reasonably astute  arguably world class worrier. One of my girlfriends in graduate school  Marie  said   Kim  I figured it out. It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else  it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are.  So in the spirit of full disclosure  I brought some pictures to share. Awwww. I'll just say  July. Zzzzzzip for safety. Water wings    an inch of water. And then  finally  all suited up for the    minute drive to Copper Mountain. So you can get kind of a feel for this. So my baby  Vander  is eight years old now. And  despite being cursed with my athletic inability  he plays soccer. He's interested in playing football. He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. So why would I worry  Because this is what I do. This is what I teach. It's what I study. It's what I treat. And I know that kids get concussed every year. In fact  more than four million people sustain a concussion every year  and these data are just among kids under    who were seen in emergency rooms. And so when kids sustain a concussion  we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung  but what is it that we're really talking about  Let's take a look. All right.  Starsky and Hutch   arguably  yes. So a car accident. Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier       Gs. A heavy weight boxer punches you straight in the face       Gs. In case you missed it  we'll look again. So look to the right hand side of the screen. What would you say  How many Gs  Close. Seventy two. Would it be crazy to know      Gs. The average concussive impact is    Gs. Now  when the kid on the right doesn't get up  we know they've had a concussion. But how about the kid on the left  or the athlete that leaves the field of play  How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion  How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play  cleared for return to play  applies to them  The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness. It requires only a change in consciousness  and that can be any one of a number of symptoms  including feeling foggy  feeling dizzy  hearing a ringing in your ear  being more impulsive or hostile than usual. So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am  how do I get any sleep at all  Because I know our brains are resilient. They're designed to recover from an injury. If  God forbid  any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion  most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks. But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury. In fact  high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college age peers  and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline. After that first injury  their risk for second injury is exponentially greater. From there  their risk for a third injury  greater still  and so on. And here's the really alarming part  we don't fully understand the long term impact of multiple injuries. You guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL. In a nutshell  this research suggests that among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions  the incidents of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population. So you've all seen that    New York Times  you've seen it. What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said   Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing his keys  Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing the car  Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing his way home in the car  from the driveway   So I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child. So it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around some day. So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids  How can we     percent guarantee the safety of our kids  Let me tell you what I've come up with. If only. My little boy's right there  and he's like   She's not kidding. She's totally not kidding.  So in all seriousness  should my kid play football  Should your kid play football  I don't know. But I do know there are three things you can do. The first  study up. You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today. There are some great resources out there. The CDC has a program  Heads Up. It's at CDC.gov. Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids. The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of. We've just rolled this out in the last couple months    CO Kids With Brain Injury. This is a great resource for student athletes  teachers  parents  professionals  athletic and coaching staff. It's a great place to start if you have questions. The second thing is  speak up. Just two weeks ago  a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have required athletes  kids under     to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee. It died in large part because it lacked constituent buy in  it lacked stakeholder traction. Now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support  but I am going to tell you that  if it matters to you  your legislators need to know that. Speak up also with coaching staff. Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available. What's the budget for protective equipment  How old it is  Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear    which brings us to suit up. Wear a helmet. The only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening. Recently  one of my graduate students  Tom said   Kim  I've decided to wear a bike helmet on my way to class.  And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the G force of impact by half. Now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade  right  this epiphany of Tom's. As it turns out  it occurred to Tom that a     helmet is a good way to protect a          graduate education. So  should Vander play football  I can't say no  but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet    like to the car  or at school. So whether athlete  scholar  over protected kid  neurotic mom  or otherwise  here's my baby  Vander  reminding you to mind your matter. Thank you. I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion. It was deep at night. I do not remember what time it was. I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. Everything in my room was shaking    my heart  my windows  my bed  everything. I looked out the windows and I saw a full half circle of explosion. I thought it was just like the movies  but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray  and a full circle of explosion. And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared. I went back to my bed  and I prayed  and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home  that it did not kill my family that night. Thirty years have passed  and I still feel guilty about that prayer  for the next day  I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father  but did not kill his mother or his sister. His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven year old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son  for she had lost everything. This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war  and nameless refugees  whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes  dirty face  scared eyes. This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war  who we do not know their hopes  their dreams  their accomplishments  their families  their beliefs  their values. This is my story. I was that girl. I am another image and vision of another survivor of war. I am that refugee  and I am that girl. You see  I grew up in war torn Iraq  and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. We only talk about one side of it. But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it. I grew up with the colors of war    the red colors of fire and blood  the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile  so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it. I grew up with the sounds of war    the staccato sounds of gunfire  the wrenching booms of explosions  ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens. These are the sounds you would expect  but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night  the high pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous  unbearable silence.  War   a friend of mine said   is not about sound at all. It is actually about silence  the silence of humanity.  I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars. In my travels and in my work  from Congo to Afghanistan  from Sudan to Rwanda  I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same  but the fears of war are the same. You know  there is a fear of dying  and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid. It is very scary to go through that feeling of  I am about to die  or  I could die in this explosion.  But there's also the fear of losing loved ones  and I think that's even worse. It's too painful. You don't want to think about it. But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear    as Samia  a Bosnian woman  once told me  who survived the four years besiege of Sarajevo  she said   The fear of losing the 'I' in me  the fear of losing the 'I' in me.  That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me. It's like dying from inside out. A Palestinian woman once told me   It is not about the fear of one death   she said   sometimes I feel I die    times in one day   as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets. She said   But it's not fair  because there is only one life  and there should only be one death.  We have been only seeing one side of war. We have only been discussing and consumed with high level preoccupations over troop levels  drawdown timelines  surges and sting operations  when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn  where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics  tactics  weapons  dollars and casualties. This is the language of sterility. How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic. This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities. Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children. Oh. Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians. Seventy five percent of them are women and children. How interesting. Oh  half a million women in Rwanda get raped in     days. Or  as we speak now  hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated. How interesting. These just become numbers that we refer to. The front of wars is increasingly non human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space  guiding missiles toward unseen targets  while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist. It is a chess game. You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership. Checkmate. We are missing a completely other side of wars. We are missing my mother's story  who made sure with every siren  with every raid  with every cut off of electricity  she played puppet shows for my brothers and I  so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions. We are missing the story of Fareeda  a music teacher  a piano teacher  in Sarajevo  who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school  despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her  and kept the piano  the violin  the cello playing the whole duration of the war  with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats. That was her fight. That was her resistance. We are missing the story of Nehia  a Palestinian woman in Gaza who  the minute there was a cease fire in the last year's war  she left out of home  collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have  in case there is no cease fire the day after. We are missing the stories of Violet  who  despite surviving genocide in the church massacre  she kept on going on  burying bodies  cleaning homes  cleaning the streets. We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. Do you know    do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going  And the ones who are keeping that life are women. There are two sides of war. There is a side that fights  and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open. There is a side that is focused on winning battles  and there is a side that is focused on winning life. There is a side that leads the front line discussion  and there is a side that leads the back line discussion. There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting  and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs. There is a side that is led by men  and there is a side that is led by women. And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace  we must understand war and peace from both sides. We must have a full picture of what that means. In order for us to understand what actually peace means  we need to understand  as one Sudanese woman once told me   Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again.  She grew up in Sudan  in Southern Sudan  for    years of war  where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees. Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers  as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers. So that woman walked for    years  so she would not be kidnapped again. And only when there was some sort of peace  her toenails grew back again. We need to understand peace from a toenail's perspective. We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table. I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping  and the group of people who are mostly    though not exclusively    who are keeping life going in the midst of war  are not included in the negotiating table. And I do argue that women lead the back line discussion  but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion. The doctors who are not fighting  the artists  the students  the men who refuse to pick up the guns  they are  too  excluded from the negotiating tables. There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace  building of democracy  sustainable economies  any kind of stabilities  if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table. Not one  but    percent. There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls. Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals     years of the U.N. budget and equals       years of the U.N. budget allocated for women  If we just reverse that distribution of funds  perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world. And last  but not least  we need to invest in peace and women  not only because it is the right thing to do  not only because it is the right thing to do  for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today  but it is for the future. A Congolese woman  who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them  and her children saw their nine year old sibling killed in front of them  how they're doing okay right now. She got into Women for Women International's program. She got a support network. She learned about her rights. We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job. She was earning     dollars. She was doing okay. She was sending them to school. Have a new home. She said   But what I worry about the most is not any of that. I worry that my children have hate in their hearts  and when they want to grow up  they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother.  We need to invest in women  because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future. That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do. Are there good news  Of course  there are good news. There are lots of good news. To start with  these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day  and if they can  who are we not to dance  That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people  sent    million dollars  and I started this from zero  nothing  nada   unclear . They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances  not because of it. Think of how the world can be a much better place if  for a change  we have a better equality  we have equality  we have a representation and we understand war  both from the front line and the back line discussion. Rumi  a   th century Sufi poet  says   Out beyond the worlds of right doings and wrong doings  there is a field. I will meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass  the world is too full to talk about. Ideas  language  even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense.  I humbly add    humbly add    that out beyond the worlds of war and peace  there is a field  and there are many women and men  who  are meeting there. Let us make this field a much bigger place. Let us all meet in that field. Thank you. So I'm going to talk about work  specifically  why people can't seem to get work done at work  which is a problem we all kind of have. But let's sort of start at the beginning. So  we have companies and non profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort. And they expect these people who work for them to do great work    I would hope  at least. At least good work  hopefully  at least it's good work    hopefully great work. And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work. So a company  or a charity  or an organization of any kind  unless you're working in Africa  if you're really lucky to do that    most people have to go to an office every day. And so these companies  they build offices. They go out and they buy a building  or they rent a building  or they lease some space  and they fill this space with stuff. They fill it with tables  or desks  chairs  computer equipment  software  Internet access  maybe a fridge  maybe a few other things  and they expect their employees  or their volunteers  to come to that location every day to do great work. It seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that. However  if you actually talk to people and even question yourself  and you ask yourself  where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done  You'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say. If you ask people the question  Where do you need to go when you need to get something done  Typically  you get three different kinds of answers. One is kind of a place or a location or a room. Another one is a moving object  and a third is a time. So here are some examples. I've been asking people this question for about    years   Where do you go when you really need to get something done   I'll hear things like  the porch  the deck  the kitchen. I'll hear things like an extra room in the house  the basement  the coffee shop  the library. And then you'll hear things like the train  a plane  a car    so  the commute. And then you'll hear people say   Well  it doesn't really matter where I am  as long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends.  You almost never hear someone say   The office.  But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office  and they're making people go to it all the time  yet people don't do work in the office. What is that about  Why is that  Why is that happening  And what you find out is  if you dig a little bit deeper  you find out that people    this is what happens  People go to work  and they're basically trading in their work day for a series of  work moments     that's what happens at the office. You don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments. It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart  and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits  because you have    minutes here     minutes there  and something else happens  you're pulled off your work  then you have    minutes  then it's lunch  then you have something else to do ... Then you've got    minutes  and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question  and before you know it  it's   p.m.  and you look back on the day  and you realize that you didn't get anything done. We've all been through this. We probably went through it yesterday or the day before  or the day before that. You look back on your day  and you're like   I got nothing done today. I was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer. I used the software they told me to use. I went to these meetings I was asked to go to. I did these conference calls. I did all this stuff. But I didn't actually do anything. I just did tasks. I didn't actually get meaningful work done.  And what you find is that  especially with creative people    designers  programmers  writers  engineers  thinkers    that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done. You cannot ask somebody to be creative in    minutes and really think about a problem. You might have a quick idea  but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully  you need long stretches of uninterrupted time. And even though the work day is typically eight hours  how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office  How about seven hours  Six  Five  Four  When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office  Two hours  One  maybe  Very  very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office. And this is why people choose to do work at home  or they might go to the office  but they might go to the office really early in the day  or late at night when no one's around  or they stick around after everyone's left  or go in on the weekends  or they get work done on the plane  in the car or in the train  because there are no distractions. Now there are different kinds of distractions  but not the really bad distractions  which I'll talk about in a minute. And this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted  and that is sleep. I think that sleep and work are very closely related    not because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working. That's not really what I mean. I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase based  or stage based  events. Sleep is about sleep phases  or stages    some people call them different things. There are five of them  and in order to get to the really deep ones  the meaningful ones  you have to go through the early ones. If you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones    if someone bumps you in bed  or there's a sound  or whatever happens    you don't just pick up where you left off. If you're interrupted and woken up  you have to start again. So you have to go back a few phases and start again. And what ends up happening    you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning  or whenever you get up  and you're like   I didn't sleep very well. I did the sleep thing    I went to bed  I laid down  but I didn't really sleep.  People say you go  to  sleep  but you don't go to sleep  you go towards sleep  it takes a while. You've got to go through phases and stuff  and if you're interrupted  you don't sleep well. So does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they're interrupted all night  I don't think anyone would say yes. Why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office  How can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted  That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense  to me. So what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places  Because in other places  you can have interruptions like the TV  or you could go for a walk  or there's a fridge downstairs  or you've got your own couch  or whatever you want to do. If you talk to certain managers  they'll tell you that they don't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions. They'll sometimes also say   If I can't see the person  how do I know they're working   which is ridiculous  but that's one of the excuses that managers give. And I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes. We all have to improve on this sort of thing. But oftentimes they'll cite distractions   I can't let someone work at home. They'll watch TV  or do this other thing.  It turns out those aren't the things that are distracting  Because those are voluntary distractions. You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV  when you want to turn something on  or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk. At the office  most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary. So let's go through a couple of those. Now  managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites  and in fact  they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work. Some of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites. I mean  is this China  What the hell is going on here  You can't go to a website at work  and that's the problem  That's why people aren't getting work done  because they're on Facebook and Twitter  That's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy. Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube  these things are just modern day smoke breaks. No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for    minutes    years ago  so why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook or Twitter or YouTube here and there  Those aren't the real problems in the office. The real problems are what I like to call the M Ms  the Managers and the Meetings. Those are the real problems in the modern office today. And this is why things don't get done at work  it's because of the M Ms. Now what's interesting is  if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work  like at home  in the car  on a plane  late at night  or early in the morning  you don't find managers and meetings. You find a lot of other distractions  but not managers and meetings. So these are the things that you don't find elsewhere  but you do find at the office. And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people. That's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people. They don't really do the work  so they make sure everyone else is doing work  which is an interruption. We have lots of managers in the world now  and a lot of people in the world  and a lot of interruptions by these managers. They have to check in   Hey  how's it going  Show me what's up.  This sort of thing. They keep interrupting you at the wrong time  while you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do  they tend to interrupt you. That's kind of bad. But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all  which is call meetings. And meetings are just toxic  terrible  poisonous things during the day at work. We all know this to be true  and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees. It doesn't work that way. The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together  and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people    to say   Hey look  we're going to bring    people together right now and have a meeting. I don't care what you're doing  you've got to stop doing it  so you can have this meeting.  I mean  what are the chances that all    people are ready to stop  What if they're thinking about something important  or doing important work  All of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else. So they go into a meeting room  they get together  and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter  usually. Because meetings aren't work. Meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later. But meetings also procreate. So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting  which leads to another meeting. There's often too many people in the meetings  and they're very  very expensive to the organization. Companies often think of a one hour meeting as a one hour meeting  but that's not true  unless there's only one person. If there are    people  it's a    hour meeting  not a one hour meeting. It's    hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one hour meeting  which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes. But instead  there's a long scheduled meeting  because meetings are scheduled the way software works  which is in increments of    minutes  or    minutes  or an hour. You don't schedule an eight hour meeting with Outlook  you can't. You can go    minutes or    minutes or    minutes or an hour. And so we tend to fill these times up when things should go really quickly. So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today  especially at offices. These things don't exist outside of the office. So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation. What can managers do    enlightened managers  hopefully    what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work  so it's not the last resort  but it's the first resort  so that people start to say   When I really want to get stuff done  I go to the office.  Because the offices are well equipped  everything is there for them to do the work. But they don't want to go there right now  so how do we change that  I have three suggestions to share with you. I have about three minutes  so that'll fit perfectly. We've all heard of the Casual Friday thing. I don't know if people still do that. But how about  No talk Thursdays   Pick one Thursday once a month  and cut it in half  just the afternoon    I'll make it easy for you. So just the afternoon  one Thursday. First Thursday of the month  just the afternoon  nobody in the office can talk to each other. Just silence  that's it. And what you'll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other. This is when people actually get stuff done  is when no one's bothering them or interrupting them. Giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work. It's better than a computer  better than a new monitor  better than new software  or whatever people typically use. Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable. If you try that  I think you'll agree  and hopefully you can do it more often. So maybe it's every other week  or every week  once a week  afternoons no one can talk to each other. That's something that you'll find will really  really work. Another thing you can try  is switching from active communication and collaboration  which is like face to face stuff    tapping people on the shoulder  saying hi to them  having meetings  and replace that with more passive models of communication  using things like email and instant messaging  or collaboration products  things like that. Now some people might say email is really distracting  I.M. is really distracting  and these other things are really distracting  but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing. You can quit the email app  you can't quit your boss. You can quit I.M.  you can't hide your manager. You can put these things away  and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule  at your own time  when you're available  when you're ready to go again. Because work  like sleep  happens in phases. So you'll be going up  doing some work  and then you'll come down from that work  and then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M. There are very  very few things that are that urgent  that need to happen  that need to be answered right this second. So if you're a manager  start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email and other things that someone can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule. And the last suggestion I have is that  if you do have a meeting coming up  if you have the power  just cancel it. Just cancel that next meeting. Today's Friday  usually people have meetings on Monday. Just don't have it. I don't mean move it  I mean just erase it from memory  it's gone. And you'll find out that everything will be just fine. All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at   a.m. on Monday  just forget about them  and things will be fine. People will have a more open morning  they can actually think. You'll find out all these things you thought you had to do  you don't actually have to do. So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about. I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people  to think about laying off a little bit  and giving people more time to get work done. I think it'll all pay off in the end. So  thanks for listening. Thank you very much. I have a few pictures  and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. All these houses are built from between    and    percent recycled material  stuff that was headed to the mulcher  the landfill  the burn pile. It was all just gone. This is the first house I built. This double front door here with the three light transom that was headed to the landfill. Have a little turret there. And then these buttons on the corbels here. Right there    those are hickory nuts. And these buttons there    those are chicken eggs. Of course  first you have breakfast  and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up  and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time. Then  this is a look at the inside. You can see the three light transom there with the eyebrow windows    certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill. Even the lockset is probably worth     dollars. Everything in the kitchen was salvaged. There's a      O'Keefe   Merritt stove  if you like to cook    cool stove. This is going up into the turret. I got that staircase for    dollars  including delivery to my lot. Then  looking up in the turret  you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. Well  if that ruins your life  well then you shouldn't live there. This is a laundry chute  and this right here is a shoe last. And those are those cast iron things you see at antique shops. So I had one of those  so I made some low tech gadgetry  there  where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open  you throw your laundry down. And then if you're smart enough  it goes on a basket on top of the washer. If not  it goes into the toilet. This is a bathtub I made  made out of scrap two by four here. Started with a rim there and then glued and nailed it up into a flat  corbelled it up and flipped it over  then did the two profiles on this side. It's a two person tub. After all  it's not just a question of hygiene  but there's a possibility of recreation as well. Then  this faucet here is just a piece of Osage Orange. It looks a little phallic  but after all  it's a bathroom. Then  this is a house based on a Budweiser can. It doesn't look like a can of beer  but the design take offs are absolutely unmistakable. The barley hops design worked up into the eaves  then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red  white  blue and silver. Then  these corbeles going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can. I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. Then  on the can it says   This is the famous Budweiser beer  we know of no other beer  blah  blah  blah.  So we changed that and put   This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house   and so forth and so on. Then  this is a deadbolt. It's a fence from a     s shaper  which is a very angry woodworking machine. And they gave me the fence  but they didn't give me the shaper  so we made a deadbolt out of it. That'll keep bull elephants out  I promise. And sure enough  we've had no problems with bull elephants. The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. We've got bubbles going up there  then suds at the top with lumpy tiles. Where do you get lumpy tiles  Well  of course  you don't. But I get a lot of toilets  and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer  and then you have lumpy tiles. And then the faucet  there  is a beer tap. Then  this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle class front door in America. We're getting tired of it. It's kind of cliched now. So if you put it in the front door  your design fails. So don't put it in the front door  put it somewhere else. It's a pretty panel of glass. But then if you put it in the front door  people say   Oh  you're trying to be like those guys  and you didn't make it.  So don't put it there. Then  another bathroom upstairs. This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle class foyer in America. Don't put it in the foyer. Put it in the shower  or in the closet  but not in the foyer. Then  somebody gave me a bidet  so it got a bidet. This little house here  those branches there are made out of Bois D'arc or Osage Orange  and these pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit. In order to do what I do  you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry. Our housing has become a commodity  and I'll talk a little bit about that. But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. What does that mean  What it means is  for every perception we have  it needs to tally with the one like it before  or we don't have continuity  and we become a little bit disoriented. So I can show you an object you've never seen before. Oh  that's a cell phone. But you've never seen this one before. What you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features here  and then you go through your databanks    brrrr  cell phone. Oh  that's a cell phone. If I took a bite out of it  you'd go   Wait a second. That's not a cell phone. That's one of those new chocolate cell phones.  And you'd have to start a new category  right between cell phones and chocolate. That's how we process information. So you translate that to the building industry  if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked  we go   Oh  dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. Let's take it out. Throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in.  Because that's what you do with a cracked pane. Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all. It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features. However  if we took a small hammer  and we added cracks to all the other windows  then we have a pattern. Because Gestalt Psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. We'll go   Ooh  that's nice.  So  that serves me every day. Repetition creates pattern. If I have a hundred of these  a hundred of those  it doesn't make any difference what these and those are. If I can repeat anything  I have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs  shards of glass  branches. It doesn't make any difference. That causes a lot of waste in the building industry. Second is  Friedrich Nietzsche along about      wrote a book titled  The Birth of Tragedy.  And in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives. On the one hand  we have an Apollonian perspective  which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect. On the other end of the spectrum  we have a Dionysian perspective  which is more given to the passions and intuition  tolerant of organic texture and human gesture. So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture  or hangs a picture  is they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer.  Okay  honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect.  Predicated on plumb level  square and centered. The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes ... That's the difference. I feature blemish. I feature organic process. Dead center John Dewey. Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. If something isn't perfect  if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model  dumpster.  Oops  scratch  dumpster.   Oops  this   oops  that.  Landfill. Landfill. Landfill.  The third thing is arguably    the Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism  then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution. By the middle of the   th century  it's in full flower. And we have dumaflages and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we  up to that point  had to do my hand. So now we have standardized materials. Well  trees don't grow two inches by four inches  eight  ten and twelve feet tall. We create mountains of waste. And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest  working all the byproduct of their industry    with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on    but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption  and that's what's happening. And so if something isn't standard   Oops  dumpster.   Oops  this.  Oops  warped.  If you buy a two by four and it's not straight  you can take it back.  Oh  I'm so sorry  sir. We'll get you a straight one.  Well I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern  and it's from a Dionysian perspective. The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials. Well  that's just a myth. And here's a story  Jim Tulles  one of the guys I trained  I said   Jim  it's time now. I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. It's time for you to go.   Dan  I just don't think I'm ready.   Jim  now it's time. You're the down  oh.  So we hired on. And he was out there with his tape measure going through the trash heap  looking for header material  which is the board that goes over a door  thinking he'd impress his boss    that's how we taught him to do it. And the superintendent walked up and said   What are you doing    Oh  just looking for some header material   waiting for that kudos. He said   No  no. I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work.  And he had the wherewithal to say  he said   You know  if you were paying me     dollars an hour  I can see how you might say that  but right now  I'm saving you five dollars a minute. Do the math.   Good call  Tulles. From now on  you guys hit this pile first.  And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math. But once in a while you get access to the control room  and then you can kind of mess with the dials. And that's what happened there. The fifth thing is that maybe  after       years  Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms. He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want  and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. So we all have in our head the perfect house  the American dream  which is a house  the dream house. The problem is we can't afford it. So we have the American dream look alike  which is a mobile home. Now there's a blight on the planet. It's a chattel mortgage  just like furniture  just like a car. You write the check  and instantly it depreciates    percent. After a year  you can't get insurance on everything you have in it  only on    percent. Wired with    gauge wire typically. Nothing wrong with that  unless you ask it to do what    gauge wire's supposed to do  and that's what happens. It out gasses formaldehyde so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger. Are we just being numbingly stupid  The walls are this thick. The whole thing has the structural value of corn.  So I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there.   No  no. We had a wind last night. It's gone now.  Then when they degrade  what do you do with them  Now  all that  that Apollonian  Platonic model  is what the building industry is predicated on  and there are a number of things that exacerbate that. One is that all the professionals  all the tradesmen  vendors  inspectors  engineers  architects all think like this. And then it works its way back to the consumer  who demands the same model. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it. Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers.  Woo. Woohooo.  We buy stuff we didn't know we needed. All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. How disgusting. But you know what they did  They hooked a metaphor into it and said   I drink Dr. Pepper ...  And pretty soon  we're swilling that stuff by the lake ful  by the billions of gallons. It doesn't even have real prunes. Doesn't even keep you regular. My oh my  that makes it worse. And we get sucked into that faster than anything. Then a man named Jean Paul Sartre wrote a book titled  Being and Nothingness.  It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe two years if you read eight hours a day. In there he talked about the divided self. He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around. So if I'm eating spaghetti  and I know I'm alone  I can eat like a backhoe. I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve  napkin on the table  chew with my mouth open  make little noises  scratch wherever I want. But as soon as you walk in  I go   Ooh. Spaghetti sauce there.  Napkin in my lap  half bites  chew with my mouth closed  no scratching. Now what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. I feel that expectation  and so I accommodate it  and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do. That happens in the building industry as well. That's why all of our subdivisions look the same. Sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations. I'll bet all your shoes match. Sure enough  we all buy into that  and with gated communities  we have a formalized expectation with a homeowners association. Sometimes those guys are Nazis  my oh my. That exacerbates and continues this model. The last thing is gregariousness. Human beings are a social species. We like to hang together in groups  just like wildebeests  just like lions. Wildebeests don't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests. Human beings are like that. We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with. And so you see this in junior high a lot. Those kids  they'll work all summer long  kill themselves  so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans. So along about September they can stride in and go   I'm important today. See  look  don't touch my designer jeans. I see you don't have designer jeans. You're not one of the beautiful people. See  I'm one of the beautiful people. See my jeans   Right there is reason enough to have uniforms. And so that happens in the building industry as well. We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs just a little bit. On the bottom tier we have basic needs    shelter  clothing  food  water  mating and so forth. Second  security. Third  relationships. Fourth  status  self esteem    that is  vanity. And we're taking vanity and shoving it down here. And so we end up with vain decisions and we can't even afford our mortgage. We can't even afford to eat anything except beans. That is  our housing has become a commodity. And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal  terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity  but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. That takes a little bit of nerve  and  darn it  once in a while you fail. But that's okay. If failure destroys you  then you can't do this. I fail all the time  every day  and I've had some whopping failures  I promise  big  public  humiliating  embarrassing failures. Everybody points and laughs  and they say   He tried it a fifth time and it still didn't work. What a moron.  Early on  contractors come by and say   Dan  you're a cute little bunny  but you know  this just isn't going to work. What don't you do this  and why don't you do that   And your instinct is to say   Why don't you suck an egg   But you don't say that  because they're the guys you're targeting. And so what we've done    and this isn't just in housing. It's in clothing and food and our transportation needs  our energy    we sprawl just a little bit. And when I get a little bit of press  I hear from people all over the world. And we may have invented excess  but the problem of waste is worldwide. We're in trouble. And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana  but we're clearly in trouble. And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say   You know  I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. What do you think  honey   If it doesn't work  take it down. What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are  and that's thrilling indeed. Thank you very much. Hello. My name is Birke Baehr  and I'm    years old. I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. First of all  I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV  at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids  like me  to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. Little kids  especially  are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. I must admit  I used to be one of them. I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy  little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day. What I discovered was this is not true. I began to look into this stuff on the Internet  in books and in documentary films  in my travels with my family. I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. First  there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature    like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. Don't get me wrong  I like fish and tomatoes  but this is just creepy. The seeds are then planted  then grown. The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals  and people have been eating food produced this way since the     s. And most folks don't even know they exist. Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity  These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. And let me tell you  corn is in everything. And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS. Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. Next  more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables  like pesticides and herbicides  to kill weeds and bugs. When it rains  these chemicals seep into the ground  or run off into our waterways  poisoning our water too. Then they irradiate our food  trying to make it last longer  so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets. So I ask myself  how can I change  How can I change these things  This is what I found out. I discovered that there's a movement for a better way. Now a while back  I wanted to be an NFL football player. I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. Thank you. And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. This man  Joel Salatin  they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. Since I'm home schooled  I went to go hear him speak one day. This man  this  lunatic farmer   doesn't use any pesticides  herbicides  or genetically modified seeds. And so for that  he's called crazy by the system. I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices  by buying our food directly from local farmers  or our neighbors who we know in real life. Some people say organic or local food is more expensive  but is it really  With all these things I've been learning about the food system  it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer  or we can pay the hospital. Now I know definitely which one I would choose. I want you to know that there are farms out there    like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee    whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud  just like I thought. Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer  so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from. I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. I want you to know that me  my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. I try to share this everywhere I go. Not too long ago  my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal. He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes    you know  the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. And that  my friends  is how we can make a difference one kid at a time. So next time you're at the grocery store  think local  choose organic  know your farmer and know your food. Thank you. Well  the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East  of a man who left to his three sons     camels. To the first son  he left half the camels  to the second son  he left a third of the camels  and to the youngest son  he left a ninth of the camels. The three sons got into a negotiation       doesn't divide by two. It doesn't divide by three. It doesn't divide by nine. Brotherly tempers started to get strained. Finally  in desperation  they went and they consulted a wise old woman. The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time  and finally she came back and said   Well  I don't know if I can help you  but at least  if you want  you can have my camel.  So then  they had    camels. The first son took his half    half of    is nine. The second son took his third    a third of    is six. The youngest son took his ninth    a ninth of    is two. You get   . They had one camel left over. They gave it back to the wise old woman. Now  if you think about that story for a moment  I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in. They start off like    camels  no way to resolve it. Somehow  what we need to do is step back from those situations  like that wise old woman  look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an   th camel. Finding that   th camel in the world's conflicts has been my life passion. I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. We're all one family. We know that scientifically  thanks to the communications revolution  all the tribes on the planet    all        tribes    are in touch with each other. And it's a big family reunion. And yet  like many family reunions  it's not all peace and light. There's a lot of conflict  and the question is  How do we deal with our differences  How do we deal with our deepest differences  given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction  That's the question. As I've spent the last better part of three decades  almost four  traveling the world  trying to work  getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela    some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet    I've been asking myself that question. And I think I've found  in some ways  what is the secret to peace. It's actually surprisingly simple. It's not easy  but it's simple. It's not even new. It may be one of our most ancient human heritages. The secret to peace is us. It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict  who can play a constructive role. Let me give you just a story  an example. About    years ago  I was in South Africa  working with the parties in that conflict  and I had an extra month  so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen. I was curious about them  about the way in which they resolve conflict. Because  after all  within living memory  they were hunters and gatherers  living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe    percent of the human story. And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting    absolutely fatal. So how do they deal with their differences  Well  what I learned is  whenever tempers rise in those communities  someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush  and then everyone sits around in a circle like this  and they sit and they talk and they talk. It may take two days  three days  four days  but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet    a reconciliation. And if tempers are still too high  then they send someone off to visit some relatives  as a cooling off period. Well  that system is  I think  probably the system that kept us alive to this point  given our human tendencies. That system  I call  the third side.  Because if you think about it  normally when we think of conflict  when we describe it  there's always two sides    it's Arabs versus Israelis  labor versus management  husband versus wife  Republicans versus Democrats. But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side  and the third side of the conflict is us  it's the surrounding community  it's the friends  the allies  the family members  the neighbors. And we can play an incredibly constructive role. Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake. For the sake of the kids  for the sake of the family  for the sake of the community  for the sake of the future  let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking. Because  the thing is  when we're involved in conflict  it's very easy to lose perspective. It's very easy to react. Human beings    we're reaction machines. And as the saying goes  when angry  you will make the best speech you will ever regret. And so the third side reminds us of that. The third side helps us go to the balcony  which is a metaphor for a place of perspective  where we can keep our eyes on the prize. Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience. Some years ago  I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya. There was a war going on  as you know. And we met in the Hague  in the Peace Palace  in the same room where the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place. And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said   You should stay right here in your seats  because you're going to be on trial for war crimes.  And then he turned to me and said   You're an American. Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico.  And my mind started racing   Puerto Rico  What do I know about Puerto Rico   I started reacting. But then  I tried to remember to go to the balcony. And then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response  from a balcony perspective  I was able to thank him for his remarks and say   I appreciate your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another.   And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past. We're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya.  The conversation got back on track. That's the role of the third side  to help the parties go to the balcony. Now let me take you  for a moment  to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict  or the most impossible conflict  the Middle East. Question is  where's the third side there  How could we possibly go to the balcony  Now  I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict  but I think I've got a first step    literally  a first step    something that any one of us could do as third siders. Let me just ask you one question first. How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do  Just out of curiosity  how many of you  OK  so the great majority of us. And here  it's so far away. Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict  Is it the number of deaths  There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East. No  it's because of the story  because we feel personally involved in that story. Whether we're Christians  Muslims or Jews  religious or non religious  we feel we have a personal stake in it. Stories matter  as an anthropologist  I know that. Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. They give meaning to our lives. That's what we tell here at TED  we tell stories. Stories are the key. And so my question is    yes  let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East  but let's also take a look at the story. Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about. Let's see if we can apply the third side to it. What would that mean  What is the story there  Now  as anthropologists  we know that every culture has an origin story. What's the origin story of the Middle East  In a phrase  it's  Four thousand years ago  a man and his family walked across the Middle East  and the world has never been the same since. That man  of course  was Abraham. And what he stood for was unity  the unity of the family  he's the father of us all. But it's not just what he stood for  it's what his message was. His basic message was unity too  the interconnectedness of it all  the unity of it all. And his basic value was respect  was kindness toward strangers. That's what he's known for  his hospitality. So in that sense  he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East. He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole. Now  think about that for a moment. Today  we face the scourge of terrorism. What is terrorism  Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear. What's the opposite of terrorism  It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home  in order to sow and create understanding or respect  or love. So what if  then  you took the story of Abraham  which is a third side story  what if that could be    because Abraham stands for hospitality    what if that could be an antidote to terrorism  What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance  How would you bring that story to life  Now  it's not enough just to tell a story. That's powerful  but people need to experience the story. They need to be able to live the story. How would you do that  And that was my thinking of how would you do that. And that's what comes to the first step here. Because the simple way to do that is  you go for a walk. You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. You retrace the footsteps of Abraham. Because walking has a real power. You know  as an anthropologist  walking is what made us human. It's funny    when you walk  you walk side by side  in the same common direction. Now if I were to come to you face to face and come this close to you  you would feel threatened. But if I walk shoulder to shoulder  even touching shoulders  it's no problem. Who fights while they walk  That's why in negotiations  often  when things get tough  people go for walks in the woods. So the idea came to me of  what about inspiring a path  a route    think the Silk Route  think the Appalachian Trail    that followed in the footsteps of Abraham  People said   That's crazy. You can't. You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham    it's too insecure  you've got to cross all these borders  it goes across    different countries in the Middle East  because it unites them all.  And so we studied the idea at Harvard. We did our due diligence. And then a few years ago  a group of us  about    of us from    different countries  decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham  going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey  Northern Mesopotamia. And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran  where  in the Bible  he sets off on his journey. Then we crossed the border into Syria  went to Aleppo  which  turns out  is named after Abraham. We went to Damascus  which has a long history associated with Abraham. We then came to Northern Jordan  to Jerusalem    which is all about Abraham    to Bethlehem  and finally  to the place where he's buried  in Hebron. So effectively  we went from womb to tomb. We showed it could be done. It was an amazing journey. Let me ask you a question. How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land  and a total stranger  perfect stranger  comes up to you and shows you some kindness    maybe invites you into their home  gives you a drink  gives you a coffee  gives you a meal  How many of you have ever had that experience  That's the essence of the Abraham Path. That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility  and you get the most amazing hospitality  all associated with Abraham   In the name of Father Ibrahim  let me offer you some food.  So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people  he's alive  he's a living presence. And to make a long story short  in the last couple of years now  thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East  enjoying the hospitality of the people there. They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine  in Jordan  in Turkey  in Syria. It's an amazing experience. Men  women  young people  old people    more women than men  actually  interestingly. For those who can't walk  who are unable to get there right now  people started to organize walks in cities  in their own communities. In Cincinnati  for instance  they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together. It was Abraham Path Day. In S o Paulo  Brazil  it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run  uniting the different communities. The media love it  they really adore it. They lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea  this idea of Abrahamic hospitality  of kindness towards strangers. And just a couple weeks ago  there was an NPR story on it. Last month  there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it  two whole pages. And they quoted a villager who said   This walk connects us to the world.  He said   It was like a light that went on in our lives    it brought us hope.  And so that's what it's about. But it's not just about psychology  it's about economics. Because as people walk  they spend money. And this woman right here  Um Ahmad  is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. She's desperately poor. She's partially blind  her husband can't work  she's got seven kids. But what she can do is cook. And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home. They sit on the floor    she doesn't even have a tablecloth. She makes the most delicious food  that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside. And so more and more walkers have come  and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family. And so she told our team there  she said   You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me.  That's the potential of the Abraham Path. There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East  across the path. The potential is basically to change the game. And to change the game  you have to change the frame  the way we see things    to change the frame from hostility to hospitality  from terrorism to tourism. And in that sense  the Abraham Path is a game changer. Let me just show you one thing. I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year. Now  the acorn is associated with the oak tree  of course    grows into an oak tree  which is associated with Abraham. The path right now is like an acorn  it's still in its early phase. What would the oak tree look like  When I think back to my childhood  a good part of which I spent  after being born here in Chicago  I spent in Europe. If you had been in the ruins of  say  London in       or Berlin  and you had said   Sixty years from now  this is going to be the most peaceful  prosperous part of the planet   people would have thought you were certifiably insane. But they did it  thanks to a common identity  Europe  and a common economy. So my question is  if it can be done in Europe  why not in the Middle East  Why not  thanks to a common identity  which is the story of Abraham  and thanks to a common economy that would be based  in good part  on tourism  So let me conclude  then  by saying that in the last    years  as I've worked in some of the most dangerous  difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet  I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed. It's not easy  of course. But it's possible. It was done in South Africa. It was done in Northern Ireland. It could be done anywhere. It simply depends on us. It depends on us taking the third side. So let me invite you to consider taking the third side  even as a very small step. We're about to take a break in a moment. Just go up to someone who's from a different culture  a different country  a different ethnicity    some difference    and engage them in a conversation. Listen to them. That's a third side act. That's walking Abraham's Path. After a TED Talk  why not a TED Walk  So let me just leave you with three things. One is  the secret to peace is the third side. The third side is us. Each of us  with a single step  can take the world  can bring the world a step closer to peace. There's an old African proverb that goes   When spiderwebs unite  they can halt even the lion.  If we're able to unite our third side webs of peace  we can even halt the lion of war. Thank you very much. Okay  I'm going to show you again something about our diets. And I would like to know what the audience is  and so who of you ever ate insects  That's quite a lot. But still  you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. Because there's    percent out there that really eats insects. But this is quite good. Why not eat insects  Well first  what are insects  Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. And here you see just a selection. There's six million species of insects on this planet  six million species. There's a few hundreds of mammals    six million species of insects. In fact  if we count all the individual organisms  we would come at much larger numbers. In fact  of all animals on Earth  of all animal species     percent walks on six legs. But if we would count all the individuals  and we take an average weight of them  it would amount to something like     to       kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. That means that in terms of biomass  insects are more abundant than we are  and we're not on a planet of men  but we're on a planet of insects. Insects are not only there in nature  but they also are involved in our economy  usually without us knowing. There was an estimation  a conservative estimation  a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by    billion dollars per year. It's a number    very large    a contribution to the economy of the United States for free. And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year. It was    billion U.S. dollars. Well we know that that was not a cheap war. So insects  just for free  contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude  just for free  without everyone knowing. And not only in the States  but in any country  in any economy. What do they do  They remove dung  they pollinate our crops. A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. They control pests  and they're food for animals. They're at the start of food chains. Small animals eat insects. Even larger animals eat insects. But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals  still larger animals. And at the end of the food chain  we are eating them as well. There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects. And here you see me in a small  provincial town in China  Lijiang    about two million inhabitants. If you go out for dinner  like in a fish restaurant  where you can select which fish you want to eat  you can select which insects you would like to eat. And they prepare it in a wonderful way. And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars  locusts  bee pupae    delicacies. And you can eat something new everyday. There's more than       species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe. That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating  like a cow or a pig or a sheep. More than       species    an enormous variety. And now you may think  okay  in this provincial town in China they're doing that  but not us. Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally  but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects  without any exception. You're eating at least     grams per year. What are you eating  Tomato soup  peanut butter  chocolate  noodles    any processed food that you're eating contains insects  because insects are here all around us  and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops. Some fruits get some insect damage. Those are the fruits  if they're tomato  that go to the tomato soup. If they don't have any damage  they go to the grocery. And that's your view of a tomato. But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup  and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency  there can be all kinds of things in there  no problem. In fact  why would we put these balls in the soup  there's meat in there anyway  In fact  all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. So anything is a good protein source already. Now you may say   Okay  so we're eating     grams just by accident.  We're even doing this on purpose. In a lot of food items that we have    I have only two items here on the slide    pink cookies or surimi sticks or  if you like  Campari    a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. The surimi sticks  of  crabmeat  or is being sold as crab meat  is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. It's being produced in large amounts      to     metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru  and it's big business. One gram of cochineal costs about    euros. One gram of gold is    euros. So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods. Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me  for everyone on this Earth. The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. Where  at the moment  we have something between six and seven billion people  it will grow to about nine billion in     . That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed  and this is something that worries more and more people. There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. How are we going to feed this world  And if you look at the figures up there  it says that we have a third more mouths to feed  but we need an agricultural production increase of    percent. And that's especially because this world population is increasing  and it's increasing  not only in numbers  but we're also getting wealthier  and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. And meat  in fact  is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production. Our diet consists   in  some part  of animal proteins  and at the moment  most of us here get it from livestock  from fish  from game. And we eat quite a lot of it. In the developed world it's on average    kilograms per person per year  which goes up to     in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries  but on average    kilograms per person per year. In the developing world it's much lower. It's    kilograms per person per year. But it's increasing enormously. In China in the last    years  it increased from    to     and it's still increasing. So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from    to    on average  and a third of the world population is living in China and in India  we're having an enormous demand on meat. And of course  we are not there to say that's only for us  it's not for them. They have the same share that we have. Now to start with  I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. We could do with much  much less    and I know  I've been a vegetarian for a long time  and you can easily do without anything. You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production  and we're being faced with that more and more often. The first problem that we're facing is human health. Pigs are quite like us. They're even models in medicine  and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. That means that pigs also share diseases with us. And a pig disease  a pig virus  and a human virus can both proliferate  and because of their kind of reproduction  they can combine and produce a new virus. This has happened in the Netherlands in the     s during the classical swine fever outbreak. You get a new disease that can be deadly. We eat insects    they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen. So that's one point for insects. And there's the conversion factor. You take    kilograms of feed  you can get one kilogram of beef  but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. So if you would be an entrepreneur  what would you do  With    kilograms of input  you can get either one or nine kg. of output. So far we're taking the one  or up to five kilograms of output. We're not taking the bonus yet. We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. So that's two points for insects. And there's the environment. If we take    kilograms of food    and it results in one kilogram of beef  the other nine kilograms are waste  and a lot of that is manure. If you produce insects  you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. So less waste. Furthermore  per kilogram of manure  you have much  much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. So you have less waste  and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. So that's three points for insects. Now there's a big  if   of course  and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality. Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein  or fat  or vitamins  it's very good. In fact  it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. And even in terms of calories  it is very good. One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as    hot dogs  or six Big Macs. So that's four points for insects. I can go on  and I could make many more points for insects  but time doesn't allow this. So the question is  why not eat insects  I gave you at least four arguments in favor. We'll have to. Even if you don't like it  you'll have to get used to this because at the moment     percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock. That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding  but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests  but there's a limitation very soon. And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by    percent  we're not going to make it that way. We could much better change from meat  from beef  to insects. And then    percent of the world already eats insects  so we are just a minority    in a country like the U.K.  the USA  the Netherlands  anywhere. On the left hand side  you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. On the right hand side you see a grasshopper. So people there are eating them  not because they're hungry  but because they think it's a delicacy. It's just very good food. You can vary enormously. It has many benefits. In fact  we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper  shrimps  a delicacy being sold at a high price. Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp  There are a few people who don't like shrimp  but shrimp  or crabs  or crayfish  are very closely related. They are delicacies. In fact  a locust is a  shrimp  of the land  and it would make very good into our diet. So why are we not eating insects yet  Well that's just a matter of mindset. We're not used to it  and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. That's why we're changing the perception of insects. And I'm working very hard with my colleague  Arnold van Huis  in telling people what insects are  what magnificent things they are  what magnificent jobs they do in nature. And in fact  without insects  we would not be here in this room  because if the insects die out  we will soon die out as well. If we die out  the insects will continue very happily. So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. And some might think  well they're not yet available. Well they are. There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them  and one of them is here in the audience  Marian Peeters  who's in the picture. I predict that later this year  you'll get them in the supermarkets    not visible  but as animal protein in the food. And maybe by       you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. A Dutch chocolate maker. So there's even a lot of design to it. Well in the Netherlands  we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture  and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. over to the Hague recently  she went to a high class restaurant  and they ate insects all together. It's not something that is a hobby of mine. It's really taken off the ground. So why not eat insects  You should try it yourself. A couple of years ago  we had       people all together in a square in Wageningen town  and they ate insects at the same moment  and this was still big  big news. I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects  because it's just a normal way of doing. So you can try it yourself today  and I would say  enjoy. And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries  and he can have the first bite. Bruno Giussani  Look at them first. Look at them first. Marcel Dicke  It's all protein. BG  That's exactly the same  one  you saw in the video actually. And it looks delicious. They just make it  with  nuts or something. MD  Thank you. I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey   extraordinarily rewarding journey  actually   which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. As a child  I had two passions. One was a passion for rodents. I had all kinds of rats  mice  hamsters  gerbils  squirrels. You name it  I bred it  and I sold them to pet shops. I also had a passion for Africa. Growing up in a multicultural environment  we had African students in the house  and I learned about their stories  so different backgrounds  dependency on imported know how  goods  services  exuberant cultural diversity. Africa was truly fascinating for me. I became an industrial engineer  engineer in product development  and I focused on appropriate detection technologies  actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries. I started working in the industry  but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear  extracting and manufacturing mode. I quit my job to focus on the real world problem  landmines. We're talking '   now. Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development  which is really true. As long as these devices are there  or there is suspicion of landmines  you can't really enter into the land. Actually  there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce  which is mainly in the developing world. We chose rats. Why would you choose rats  Because  aren't they vermin  Well  actually rats are  in contrary to what most people think about them  rats are highly sociable creatures. And actually  our product    what you see here. There's a target somewhere here. You see an operator  a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. There  the animal finds a mine. It scratches on the soil. And the animal comes back for a food reward. Very  very simple. Very sustainable in this environment. Here  the animal gets its food reward. And that's how it works. Very  very simple. Now why would you use rats  Rats have been used since the '  s last century  in all kinds of experiments. Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. They're extremely sensitive to smell. Moreover  they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it. Now how do we communicate with rats  Well don't talk rat  but we have a clicker  a standard method for animal training  which you see there. A clicker  which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors. First of all  we associate the click sound with a food reward  which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. Once the animal knows click  food  click  food  click  food    so click is food    we bring it in a cage with a hole  and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed  and to do that for five seconds    five seconds  which is long for a rat. Once the animal knows this  we make the task a bit more difficult. It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes  up to    holes. Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. In the next step  animals learn to find real mines in real minefields. They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards  just like dogs have to pass a test. This consists of     square meters. There's a number of mines placed blindly  and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets. If the animal does that  it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field    just like dogs  by the way. Maybe one slight difference  we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog. This is our team in Mozambique  one Tanzanian trainer  who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people. They have a skill  which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid. Moreover  this small team together with  of course  you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de miners to follow up. But with this small investment in a rat capacity  we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost price per square meter up to    percent of what is currently normal    two dollars per square meter  we do it at   .    and we can still bring that price down. Question of scale. If you can bring in more rats  we can actually make the output even bigger. We have a demonstration site in Mozambique. Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region  and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines. But let me bring you to a very different problem. And there's about       people last year that walked on a landmine  but worldwide last year  almost  .  million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked  there is a huge common problem. Microscopy  the standard WHO procedure  reaches from    to    percent reliability. In Tanzania    the numbers don't lie       percent of people    T.B. patients    get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. It means that  if you have T.B.  you have more chance that you won't be detected  but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. And if  however  you are detected very early  diagnosed early  treatment can start  and even in HIV positives  it makes sense. You can actually cure T.B.  even in HIV positives. So in our common language  Dutch  the name for T.B. is  tering   which  etymologically  refers to the smell of tar. Already the old Chinese and the Greek  Hippocrates  have actually published  documented  that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. So what we did is we collected some samples    just as a way of testing    from hospitals  trained rats on them and see if this works  and wonder  well  we can reach    percent sensitivity     percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. This is how it works  and really  this is a generic technology. We're talking now explosives  tuberculosis  but can you imagine  you can actually put anything under there. So how does it work  You have a cassette with    samples. You put these    samples at once in the cage. An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent  so it goes extremely fast. Here it's already at the third sample. This is a positive sample. It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward. And by doing so  very fast  we can have like a second line opinion to see which patients are positive  which are negative. Just as an indication  whereas a microscopist can process    samples in a day  a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. A cage like this    A cage like this    provided that you have rats  and we have now currently    tuberculosis rats    a cage like this  operating throughout the day  can process       samples. Can you imagine the potential offspring applications    environmental detection of pollutants in soils  customs applications  detection of illicit goods in containers and so on. But let's stick first to tuberculosis. I just want to briefly highlight  the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of         people  where        reported to get a test done. Microscopy for       patients. And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back  we were able to increase case detection rates by over    percent. Throughout last year  we've been    depending on which intervals you take    we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between    and    percent. So this is really considerable. Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to    people  healthy people  per year  you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives. The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. And there are simple things like  for instance  we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. So  to standardize this. Also  to standardize the pellets  the food rewards  and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. To conclude  there are also other applications at the horizon. Here is a first prototype of our camera rat  which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on. This is in a prototype stage. We don't have a working system here yet. To conclude  I would actually like to say  you may think this is about rats  these projects  but in the end it is about people. It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult  expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks  and doing that with a local resource  plenty available. So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you  whether they are environmental  technological  animal  or human. And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world. Thank you very much. Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today     calories are taken to produce it. That's a lot. I want to take something rather humble to discuss. I found this in the farmers' market today  and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later  you're very welcome to. The humble potato    and I've spent a long time     years  preparing these. And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. First of all  it's planted  and that takes energy. It grows and is nurtured. It's then harvested. It's then distributed  and distribution is a massive issue. It's then sold and bought  and it's then delivered to me. I basically take it  prepare it  and then people consume it    hopefully they enjoy it. The last stage is basically waste  and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it. There are different types of waste. There's a waste of time  there's a waste of space  there's a waste of energy  and there's a waste of waste. And every business I've been working on over the past five years  I'm trying to lower each one of these elements. Okay  so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. Basically a restaurant just like any other. This is the restaurant  Acorn House. Front and back. So let me run you through a few ideas. Floor  sustainable  recyclable. Chairs  recycled and recyclable. Tables  Forestry Commission. This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. This bench  although it was uncomfortable for my mom    she didn't like sitting on it  so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale    reusing  a job that was pretty good. I hate waste  especially walls. If they're not working  put a shelf on it  which I did  and that shows all the customers my products. The whole business is run on sustainable energy. This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. Paint is all low volume chemical  which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. I was experimenting with these    I don't know if you can see it    but there's a work surface there. And that's a plastic polymer. And I was thinking  well I'm trying to think nature  nature  nature. But I thought  no  no  experiment with resins  experiment with polymers. Will they outlive me  They probably might. Right  here's a reconditioned coffee machine. It actually looks better than a brand new one    so looking good there. Now reusing is vital. And we filter our own water. We put them in bottles  refrigerate them  and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again. Here's a great little example. If you can see this orange tree  it's actually growing in a car tire  which has been turned inside out and sewn up. It's got my compost in it  which is growing an orange tree  which is great. This is the kitchen  which is in the same room. I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume. Rather than me putting a dish down  they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. Okay  it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. It serves     people a day. We generate quite a lot of waste. This is the waste room. You can't get rid of waste. But this story's not about eliminating it  it's about minimizing it. In here  I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable. I put my food waste into this dehydrating  desiccating macerator    turns food into an inner material  which I can store and then compost later. I compost it in this garden. All of the soil you can see there is basically my food  which is generated by the restaurant  and it's growing in these tubs  which I made out of storm felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. Three compost bins    go through about    kilos of raw vegetable waste a week    really good  makes fantastic compost. A couple of wormeries in there too. And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. And I tried taking the dried food waste  putting it to the worms  going   There you go  dinner.  It was like vegetable jerky  and killed all of them. I don't know how many worms  were  in there  but I've got some heavy karma coming  I tell you. What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. This takes the water out of the restaurant  runs it through these stone beds    this is going to be mint in there    and I sort of water the garden with it. And I ultimately want to recycle that  put it back into the loos  maybe wash hands with it  I don't know. So  water is a very important aspect. I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. If I could get Waterhouse to be a no carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with  that would be great. I managed to do it. This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House    same chairs  same tables. They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. But this is an electrical restaurant. The whole thing is electric  the restaurant and the kitchen. And it's run on hydroelectricity  so I've gone from air to water. Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water  heated by water  filters its own water  and it's powered by water. It literally is Waterhouse. The air handling system inside it    I got rid of air conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. This is basically air handling. I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside  pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism  it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof  and that  in turn  is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant  cooling them  or heating them  as the need may be. And this is an English willow air diffuser  and that's softly moving that air current through the room. Very advanced  no air conditioning    I love it. In the canal  which is just outside the restaurant  there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four degrees of heat exchange. I have no idea how it works  but I paid a lot of money for it. And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat    it's off grid  it generates all its own power. He's growing all his own fruit  and that's fantastic. There's no accident in names of these restaurants. Acorn House is the element of wood  Waterhouse is the element of water  and I'm thinking  well  I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. I've got metal and earth to come. So you've got to watch your space for that. Okay. So this is my next project. Five weeks old  it's my baby  and it's hurting real bad. The People's Supermarket. So basically  the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people. So people    i.e.  perhaps  more working class    or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative. This is a social enterprise  not for profit cooperative supermarket. It really is about the social disconnect between food  communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers    connecting communities in London to rural growers. Really important. So I'm committing to potatoes  I'm committing to milk  I'm committing to leeks and broccoli    all very important stuff. I've kept the tiles  I've kept the floors  I've kept the trunking  I've got in some recycled fridges  I've got some recycled tills  I've got some recycled trolleys. I mean  the whole thing is is super sustainable. In fact  I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. That's zero food waste. And no one's doing that just yet. In fact  Sainsbury's  if you're watching  let's have a go. Try it on. I'm going to get there before you. So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning  and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time  and it's an important statement to understand. If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food  think about the sustainable nature of it  then we may fail. But  I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible. Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. They're here. You can see I've done three so far  I've got a few more to go. The idea is embryonic. I think it's important. I think that if we reduce  reuse  refuse and recycle    right at the end there    recycling is the last point I want to make  but it's the four R's  rather than the three R's    then I think we're going to be on our way. So these three are not perfect    they're ideas. I think that there are many problems to come  but with help  I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. And I hope you all take part. Thank you very much.  Applause  It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland  because until a couple of years ago  people knew hardly anything about us  and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us. But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. First  of course  the economic meltdown. It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. Ninety nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends  including President Obama. By the way  the pronunciation is  Eyjafjallajokull.  None of your media got it right. But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital  which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin    who you see in the picture    in the spring of       just over a year before the economic collapse hit. Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm  Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. But I can surely tell you that in my country  much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere  men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector  and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems. So we decided  a bit fed up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable  to found a financial services firm based on our values  and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. We weren't known as the typical  women  women in Iceland up until then. So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. And we got a great group of people to join us    principled people with great skills  and investors with a vision and values to match ours. And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that    and also there's a factor of luck and timing    we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values. So let me share with you our values. We believe in risk awareness. What does that mean  We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking  and we will not invest in things we don't understand. Not a complicated thing. But in       at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures  it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market. We also believe in straight talking  telling it as it is  using simple language that people understand  telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides  and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter  like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. And  although we do work in the financial sector  where Excel is king  we believe in emotional capital. And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. It is actually people that make money and lose money  not Excel spreadsheets. Last  but not least  we believe in profit with principles. We care how we make our profit. So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers  we are willing to do it with a long term view  and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. So we like to see profits  plus positive social and environmental benefits  when we invest. But it wasn't just about the values  although we are convinced that they matter. It was also about a business opportunity. It's the female trend  and it's the sustainability trend  that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men  it is actually about women being different from men  bringing different values and different ways to the table. So what do you get  You get better decision making  and you get less herd behavior  and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results. But one has to wonder  now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland    and by the way  Europe looks pretty bad right now  and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. Now that we've had all that happen  and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision making tables  will we see business and finance change  Will government change  Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. I have days that I believe  but I have days that I'm full of doubt. Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us  Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity    to do the same things over and over again  hoping for a different outcome. So I guess the world is insane  because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again  hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. I want to see more revolutionary thinking  and I remain hopeful. Like TED  I believe in people. And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious  and they are going to start voting with their wallets  and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside  if they don't do it from the inside. But I'm more of the revolutionary  and I should be  I'm from Iceland. We have a long history of strong  courageous  independent women  ever since the Viking age. And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society  I was seven    it happened to be my mother's birthday    October         . Women in Iceland took the day off. From work or from home  they took the day off  and nothing worked in Iceland. They marched into the center of Reykjavik  and they put women's issues onto the agenda. And some say this was the start of a global movement. For me it was the start of a long journey  but I decided that day to matter. Five years later  Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president    first female to become head of state  single mom  a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. And at one of the campaign sessions  she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president    she was a woman  and even half a woman. That night she won the election  because she came back    not just because of his crappy behavior    but she came back and said   Well  I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation  I'm going to lead it.  So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. But in spite of that  I went through the first    or    years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. Started in corporate America  and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual  that women and men would have just the same opportunities. But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. We are not the same  and it's great. Because of our differences  we create and sustain life. So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge. The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either or choices in life    either it's men or it's women. We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there  and let's start thinking about doing good business. That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future. Thank you. I grew up in New York City  between Harlem and the Bronx. Growing up as a boy  we were taught that men had to be tough  had to be strong  had to be courageous  dominating    no pain  no emotions  with the exception of anger    and definitely no fear  that men are in charge  which means women are not  that men lead  and you should just follow and do what we say  that men are superior  women are inferior  that men are strong  women are weak  that women are of less value  property of men  and objects  particularly sexual objects. I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men  better known as the  man box.  See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. Now I also want to say  without a doubt  there are some wonderful  wonderful  absolutely wonderful things about being a man. But at the same time  there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted  and we really need to begin to challenge  look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing  redefining  what we come to know as manhood. This is my two at home  Kendall and Jay. They're    and   . Kendall's    months older than Jay. There was a period of time when my wife    her name is Tammie    and I  we just got real busy and whip  bam  boom  Kendall and Jay. And when they were about five and six  four and five  Jay could come to me  come to me crying. It didn't matter what she was crying about  she could get on my knee  she could snot my sleeve up  just cry  cry it out. Daddy's got you. That's all that's important. Now Kendall on the other hand    and like I said  he's only    months older than her    he'd come to me crying  it's like as soon as I would hear him cry  a clock would go off. I would give the boy probably about    seconds  which means  by the time he got to me  I was already saying things like   Why are you crying  Hold your head up. Look at me. Explain to me what's wrong. Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. Why are you crying   And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box  I would find myself saying things like   Just go in your room. Just go on  go on in your room. Sit down  get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a     what  Like a man. And he's five years old. And as I grow in life  I would say to myself   My God  what's wrong with me  What am I doing  Why would I do this   And I think back. I think back to my father. There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. My brother  Henry  he died tragically when we were teenagers. We lived in New York City  as I said. We lived in the Bronx at the time  and the burial was in a place called Long Island  it was about two hours outside of the city. And as we were preparing to come back from the burial  the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. And the limousine empties out. My mother  my sister  my auntie  they all get out  but my father and I stayed in the limousine  and no sooner than the women got out  he burst out crying. He didn't want cry in front of me  but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city  and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women. And this is a man who     minutes ago  had just put his teenage son in the ground    something I just can't even imagine. The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me  and at the same time  he was also giving me props  lifting me up  for not crying. I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men  this fear that just has us paralyzed  holding us hostage to this man box. I can remember speaking to a    year old boy  a football player  and I asked him  I said   How would you feel if  in front of all the players  your coach told you you were playing like a girl   Now I expected him to say something like  I'd be sad  I'd be mad  I'd be angry  or something like that. No  the boy said to me    the boy said to me   It would destroy me.  And I said to myself   God  if it would destroy him to be called a girl  what are we then teaching him about girls   It took me back to a time when I was about    years old. I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. At this time we're living in the Bronx  and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny. He was about    years old  and we were all about    years old    younger guys. And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. And this guy  he was up to a lot of no good. He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder   What is this    year old boy doing with these    year old boys   And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. He was a troubled kid. His mother had died from a heroin overdose. He was being raised by his grandmother. His father wasn't on the set. His grandmother had two jobs. He was home alone a lot. But I've got to tell you  we young guys  we looked up to this dude  man. He was cool. He was fine. That's what the sisters said   He was fine.  He was having sex. We all looked up to him. So one day  I'm out in front of the house doing something    just playing around  doing something    I don't know what. He looks out his window  he calls me upstairs  he said   Hey Anthony.  They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.  Hey Anthony  come on upstairs.  Johnny call  you go. So I run right upstairs. As he opens the door  he says to me   Do you want some   Now I immediately knew what he meant. Because for me growing up at that time  and our relationship with this man box   Do you want some   meant one of two things  sex or drugs    and we weren't doing drugs. Now my box  my card  my man box card  was immediately in jeopardy. Two things  One  I never had sex. We don't talk about that as men. You only tell your dearest  closest friend  sworn to secrecy for life  the first time you had sex. For everybody else  we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. There ain't no first time. The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. Women are objects  especially sexual objects. Anyway  so I couldn't tell him any of that. So  like my mother would say  make a long story short  I just simply said to Johnny   Yes.  He told me to go in his room. I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila. She's    years old. She's nude. She's what I know today to be mentally ill  higher functioning at times than others. We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. Anyway  Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. Well actually  he raped her  but he would say he had sex with her. Because  while Sheila never said no  she also never said yes. So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. So when I go in the room  I close the door. Folks  I'm petrified. I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything  and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something. So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do  I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. So in my    years of wisdom  I zip my pants down  I walk out into the room  and lo and behold to me  while I was in the room with Sheila  Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. So now there's a living room full of guys. It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. And they asked me how was it  and I say to them   It was good   and I zip my pants up in front of them  and I head for the door. Now I say this all with remorse  and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time  but I was conflicted  because  while I was feeling remorse  I was excited  because I didn't get caught. But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. This fear  getting outside the man box  totally enveloped me. It was way more important to me  about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her. See collectively  we as men are taught to have less value in women  to view them as property and the objects of men. We see that as an equation that equals violence against women. We as men  good men  the large majority of men  we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization. We kind of see ourselves separate  but we're very much a part of it. You see  we have to come to understand that less value  property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions  is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad. So quickly  I'd like to just say  this is the love of my life  my daughter Jay. The world I envision for her    how do I want men to be acting and behaving  I need you on board. I need you with me. I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men    that it's okay to not be dominating  that it's okay to have feelings and emotions  that it's okay to promote equality  that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it  that it's okay to be whole  that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.  Applause  I remember asking a nine year old boy  I asked a nine year old boy   What would life be like for you  if you didn't have to adhere to this man box   He said to me   I would be free.  Thank you folks. Now I'm going to give you a story. It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. Let me begin with my parents. I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. Many years ago  when I was born in the '  s    '  s and '  s didn't belong to girls in India. They belonged to boys. They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents  and girls would be dolled up to get married. My family  in my city  and almost in the country  was unique. We were four of us  not one  and fortunately no boys. We were four girls and no boys. And my parents were part of a landed property family. My father defied his own grandfather  almost to the point of disinheritance  because he decided to educate all four of us. He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. As I've said  when we're born  we don't choose our parents  and when we go to school  we don't choose our school. Children don't choose a school. They just get the school which parents choose for them. So this is the foundation time which I got. I grew up like this  and so did my other three sisters. And my father used to say at that time   I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.  I don't know if he really meant  that   but it happened. I'm the only one who's left in India. One is a British  another is an American and the third is a Canadian. So we are four of us in four corners of the world. And since I said they're my role models  I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. One  they said   Life is on an incline. You either go up  or you come down.  And the second thing  which has stayed with me  which became my philosophy of life  which made all the difference  is      things happen in your life  good or bad. Out of         are your creation. They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. If they're bad  they're your creation. Learn from it. Ten are nature sent over which you can't do a thing. It's like a death of a relative  or a cyclone  or a hurricane  or an earthquake. You can't do a thing about it. You've got to just respond to the situation. But that response comes out of those    points. Since I'm a product of this philosophy  of        and secondly   life on an incline   that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. I'm a product of opportunities  rare opportunities in the '  s and the '  s  which girls didn't get  and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry  and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. I thought I must tell you this. Why I said this  is the background. This is what comes next. I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman  a woman with indefatigable stamina  because I used to run for my tennis titles  etc. But I joined the Indian Police Service  and then it was a new pattern of policing. For me the policing stood for power to correct  power to prevent and power to detect. This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India    the power to prevent. Because normally it was always said  power to detect  and that's it  or power to punish. But I decided no  it's a power to prevent  because that's what I learned when I was growing up. How do I prevent the    and never make it more than     So this was how it came into my service  and it was different from the men. I didn't want to make it different from the men  but it was different  because this was the way I was different. And I redefined policing concepts in India. I'm going to take you on two journeys  my policing journey and my prison journey. What you see  if you see the title called  PM's car held.  This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. That's the first time in India  and I can tell you  that's the last time you're hearing about it. It'll never happen again in India  because now it was once and forever. And the rule was  because I was sensitive  I was compassionate  I was very sensitive to injustice  and I was very pro justice. That's the reason  as a woman  I joined the Indian Police Service. I had other options  but I didn't choose them. So I'm going to move on. This is about tough policing  equal policing. Now I was known as  here's a woman that's not going to listen.  So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings  postings which others would say no. I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. Normally police officers don't want to do prison. They sent me to prison to lock me up  thinking   Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. Let's lock her up.  Here I got a prison assignment. This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. Obviously  it was. But        men  of which only     were women                    plus about     were men. Terrorists  rapists  burglars  gangsters    some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. And then how did I deal with them  The first day when I went in  I didn't know how to look at them. And I said   Do you pray   When I looked at the group  I said   Do you pray   They saw me as a young  short woman wearing a pathan suit. I said   Do you pray   And they didn't say anything. I said   Do you pray  Do you want to pray   They said   Yes.  I said   All right  let's pray.  I prayed for them  and things started to change. This is a visual of education inside the prison. Friends  this has never happened  where everybody in the prison studies. I started this with community support. Government had no budget. It was one of the finest  largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. This was initiated in Delhi prison. You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. These are hundreds of classes. Nine to eleven  every prisoner went into the education program    the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. We converted this into an ashram    from a prison to an ashram through education. I think that's the bigger change. It was the beginning of a change. Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. Books came from donated schoolbooks. Stationery was donated. Everything was donated  because there was no budget of education for the prison. Now if I'd not done that  it would have been a hellhole. That's the second landmark. I want to show you some moments of history in my journey  which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. One  the numbers you'll never get to see. Secondly  this concept. This was a meditation program inside the prison of over       prisoners. One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. And this is what transformed. You want to know more about this  go and see this film   Doing Time  Doing Vipassana.  You will hear about it  and you will love it. And write to me on KiranBedi.com  and I'll respond to you. Let me show you the next slide. I took the same concept of mindfulness  because  why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison  Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. Not by preaching  not by telling  not by reading  but by addressing your mind. I took the same thing to the police  because police  equally  were prisoners of their minds  and they felt as if it was  we  and  they   and that the people don't cooperate. This worked. This is a feedback box called a petition box. This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints  listen to grievances. This was a magic box. This was a sensitive box. This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. If you see somebody in the blue    yeah  this guy    he was a prisoner  and he was a teacher. And you see  everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. Let me wrap it up. I'm currently into movements  movements of education of the under served children  which is thousands    India is all about thousands. Secondly is about the anti corruption movement in India. That's a big way we  as a small group of activists  have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. Friends  you will hear a lot about it. That's the movement at the moment I'm driving  and that's the movement and ambition of my life. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly  and in many of the places where it counts the most  women are  in fact  taking control of everything. In my mother's day  she didn't go to college. Not a lot of women did. And now  for every two men who get a college degree  three women will do the same. Women  for the first time this year  became the majority of the American workforce. And they're starting to dominate lots of professions    doctors  lawyers  bankers  accountants. Over    percent of managers are women these days  and in the    professions projected to grow the most in the next decade  all but two of them are dominated by women. So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men  believe it or not  and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture    what our romantic comedies look like  what our marriages look like  what our dating lives look like  and our new set of superheroes. For a long time  this is the image of American manhood that dominated    tough  rugged  in control of his own environment. A few years ago  the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen  who is a parody of American manhood  and that's what we have in our commercials today. The phrase  first born son  is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. In American fertility clinics     percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. And in places where you wouldn't think  such as South Korea  India and China  the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little  and families are no longer strongly preferring first born sons. If you think about this  if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots  you can see the evidence everywhere. You can see it in college graduation patterns  in job projections  in our marriage statistics  you can see it in the Icelandic elections  which you'll hear about later  and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference  that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. The '  s and the '  s also come to mind. But the difference is that  back then  it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires  whereas this time  it's not about passion  and it's not about any kind of movement. This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. The         year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end  believe it or not  and that's why I talk about the  end of men.  Now all you men out there  this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes  because the point is that this is happening to all of us. I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. And this is why I like to talk about this  because if we don't acknowledge it  then the transition will be pretty painful. But if we do take account of it  then I think it will go much more smoothly. I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else  and I started to notice a distinct pattern    that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. And I remembered back to about    years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called  Stiffed  The Betrayal of the American Man   in which she described how hard the recession had hit men  and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. And I realized that two things were different this time around. The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men    that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. And second  that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men  but it was also about what was happening to women. And now look at this second set of slides. These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. Women  a majority of the workplace. And labor statistics  women take up most managerial jobs. This second set of headlines    you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. And look at that last headline    young women earning more than young men. That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. And they expected that it would be young families  or young men  just like it had always been. But in fact  they found something very surprising. It was young  single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. And so they decided  because they were intrigued by this finding  to do a nationwide survey. So they spread out all the census data  and what they found  the guy described to me as a shocker  which is that in       out of       communities  women  young women  were making more money than young men. So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them. Now  I've just laid out the picture for you  but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. And in a moment  I'm going to show you a graph  and what you'll see on this graph    it begins in       just before women start flooding the workforce  and it brings us up to our current day. And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. Now what does that mean  It means that the economy is dividing into high skill  high wage jobs and low skill  low wage jobs    and that the middle  the middle skill jobs  and the middle earning jobs  are starting to drop out of the economy. This has been going on for    years now. But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. You'll see the women in red  and you'll see the men in blue. You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class  but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. There we go. So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. The men sort of stagnate there  while the women zoom up in those high skill jobs. So what's that about  It looks like women got some power boost on a video game  or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth control pills that lets them shoot up high. But of course  it's not about that. What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. We used to have a manufacturing economy  which was about building goods and products  and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. Those two economies require very different skills  and as it happens  women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree  but you had a specific set of skills  and with the help of a union  you could make yourself a pretty good middle class life. But that really isn't true anymore. This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength  which is what's helped men along all these years. What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. You basically need intelligence  you need an ability to sit still and focus  to communicate openly  to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be  and those are things that women do extremely well  as we're seeing. If you look at management theory these days  it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton  right  You would be issuing orders from above. You would be very hierarchical. You would tell everyone below you what to do. But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. If you read management books now  a leader is somebody who can foster creativity  who can get his    get the employees    see  I still say  his     who can get the employees to talk to each other  who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. And those are all things that women do very well. And then on top of that  that's created a kind of cascading effect. Women enter the workplace at the top  and then at the working class  all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. So that's childcare  elder care and food preparation. So those are all the jobs that are growing  and those are jobs that women tend to do. Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out of work  middle aged  former steelworker guy to watch their children at home  and that would be good for the men  but that hasn't quite happened yet. To see what's going to happen  you can't just look at the workforce that is now  you have to look at our future workforce. And here the story is fairly simple. Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. Why  This is a real mystery. People have asked men  why don't they just go back to college  to community college  say  and retool themselves  learn a new set of skills  Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. They're used to thinking of themselves as providers  and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the  boy crisis.  Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys  for whatever reason  are doing worse in school than very young girls  and people have theories about that. Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum  and little girls are better at that than little boys  Or that we require kids to sit still too much  and so boys initially feel like failures  And some people say it's because  in  th grade  boys start dropping out of school. Because I'm writing a book about all this  I'm still looking into it  so I don't have the answer. But in the mean time  I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert  who's my    year old daughter  Noa  to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse. I mean they have much larger vocabulary. They learn much faster. They are more controlled. On the board today for losing recess tomorrow  only boys. Hanna Rosin  And why is that  Noa  Why  They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely. HR  So there you go. This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City    working class college. Certainly  when I was in college  I had certain expectations about my life    that my husband and I would both work  and that we would equally raise the children. But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. Basically  the way they said it to me is that they would be working    hours a day  that their husband would maybe have a job  but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. And this was kind of a shocker to me. And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls   Men are the new ball and chain.  Now you laugh  but that quote has kind of a sting to it  right  And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain  and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. The night after I talked to these college girls  I also went to a men's group in Kansas  and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. They were men who had been contractors  or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom  and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority  that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore  and they were not really the providers. So who were they  And this was very disheartening for them. And what he did was he wrote down on the board            and he said   That's her salary   and then he wrote down         .   That's your salary. So who's the man now   he asked them.  Who's the damn man  She's the man now.  And that really sent a shudder through the room. And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this  because I think it can be pretty painful  and we really have to work through it. And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. It's happening all over the world. In India  poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. In China  a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses  small businesses  faster than men. And here's my favorite example  which is in South Korea. Over several decades  South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. They basically enshrined the second class status of women in the civil code. And if women failed to birth male children  they were basically treated like domestic servants. And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. But over the '  s and '  s  the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize  and so what they did was  they started to push women into the workforce. Now they've been asking a question since        How strongly do you prefer a first born son   And now look at the chart. That's from      to     . How much do you prefer a first born son  So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. Now because we haven't fully processed this information  it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways  where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the  omega males  popping up  who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. And they come up in lots of different forms. So we have the perpetual adolescent. We have the charmless misanthrope. Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. And then here's a shocker  even America's most sexiest man alive  the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. And then on the female side  you have the opposite  in which you have these crazy superhero women. You've got Lady Gaga. You've got our new James Bond  who's Angelina Jolie. And it's not just for the young  right  Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal. So for a long time in the economic sphere  we've lived with the term  glass ceiling.  Now I've never really liked this term. For one thing  it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another  because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. And we're always below the glass ceiling  the women. And we have a lot of skill and experience  but it's a trick  so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling  And also   shattering the glass ceiling  is a terrible phrase. What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling  So the image that I like to think of  instead of glass ceiling  is the high bridge. It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge  but it's also pretty exhilarating  because it's beautiful up there  and you're looking out on a beautiful view. And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. You can bring your husband along. You can bring your friends  or your colleagues  or your babysitter to walk along with you. And husbands can drag their wives across  if their wives don't feel ready. But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge  that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge  but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it. Thanks very much. I have been teaching for a long time  and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. In       my grandmother    bottom left for you guys over here    graduated from the eighth grade. She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. It was in the books  it was inside the teacher's head  and she needed to go there to get the information  because that's how you learned. Fast forward a generation  this is the one room schoolhouse  Oak Grove  where my father went to a one room schoolhouse. And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher  stored it in the only portable memory he has  which is inside his own head  and take it with him  because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. When I was a kid  we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. It was purchased the year I was born  and it was extraordinary  because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. The information was inside my house and it was awesome. This was different than either generation had experienced before  and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. But the information was closer to me. I could get access to it. In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching  we really see the advent of the Internet. Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool  I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas  small town Kansas  where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely  small town  rural Kansas school district  where I was teaching my favorite subject  American government. My first year    super gung ho    going to teach American government  loved the political system. Kids in the   th grade  not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. Year two  learned a few things    had to change my tactic. And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. I posed a problem in front of them  which was to put on an election forum for their own community. They produced flyers. They called offices. They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well  and really had this robust experiential learning. The older teachers    more experienced    looked at me and went   Oh  there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.   She doesn't know what she's in for.  But I knew that the kids would show up  and I believed it  and I told them every week what I expected out of them. And that night  all    kids    dressed appropriately  doing their job  owning it. I had to just sit and watch. It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. It meant something to them. And they will step up. From Kansas  I moved on to lovely Arizona  where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years  this time with middle school students. Luckily  I didn't have to teach them American government. Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. Again   thrilled  to learn. But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona  was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school  and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina  which is the gentleman that the movie  Hotel Rwanda  is based after. And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip. The problem then becomes how do you take seventh  and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful  and they know what to do with it. And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life  or in their own story  or in their own world  that they could identify that had done a similar thing. I asked them to produce a little movie about it. It's the first time we'd done this. Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer  but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves  what they're willing to share. The last question of the assignment is  how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people  The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. Fast forward to Pennsylvania  where I find myself today. I teach at the Science Leadership Academy  which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. We are a nine through    public school  but we do school quite differently. I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned  and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past  of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school  and to a moment when we have information surplus. So what do you do when the information is all around you  Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information  In Philadelphia we have a one to one laptop program  so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday  taking them home  getting access to information. And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students  is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test  and I am here to share with you  it is not learning. That is the absolute wrong thing to ask  to tell kids to never be wrong. To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. So we did this project  and this is one of the artifacts of the project. I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure. My students produced these info graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info graphics that existed in a lot of mass media  and take a look at what were the interesting components of it  and produce one for themselves of a different man made disaster from American history. And they had certain criteria to do it. They were a little uncomfortable with it  because we'd never done this before  and they didn't know exactly how to do it. They can talk    they're very smooth  and they can write very  very well  but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. But I gave them the room to just do the thing. Go create. Go figure it out. Let's see what we can do. And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. This was done in like two or three days. And this is the work of the student that consistently did it. And when I sat the students down  I said   Who's got the best one   And they immediately went   There it is.  Didn't read anything.  There it is.  And I said   Well what makes it great   And they're like   Oh  the design's good  and he's using good color. And there's some ...   And they went through all that we processed out loud. And I said   Go read it.  And they're like   Oh  that one wasn't so awesome.  And then we went to another one    it didn't have great visuals  but it had great information    and spent an hour talking about the learning process  because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect  or whether or not it was what I could create. It asked them to create for themselves  and it allowed them to fail  process  learn from. And when we do another round of this in my class this year  they will do better this time  because learning has to include an amount of failure  because failure is instructional in the process. There are a million pictures that I could click through here  and had to choose carefully    this is one of my favorites    of students learning  of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information  but instead  ask them what they can do with it. Ask them really interesting questions. They will not disappoint. Ask them to go to places  to see things for themselves  to actually experience the learning  to play  to inquire. This is one of my favorite photos  because this was taken on Tuesday  when I asked the students to go to the polls. This is Robbie  and this was his first day of voting  and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. But this is learning too  because we asked them to go out into real spaces. The main point is that  if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning  empowering student voice and embracing failure  we're missing the mark. And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities  because we won't get there with a standardized test  and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. We know how to do this better  and it's time to do better. Alisa Volkman  So this is where our story begins    the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son  Declan. Obviously a really profound moment  and it changed our lives in many ways. It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways  and those unexpected ways we later reflected on  that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us  and a year later  we launched Babble  a website for parents. Rufus Griscom  Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier. AV  That's true. RG  You may remember  we fell head over heels in love. AV  We did. RG  We were at the time running a very different kind of website. It was a website called Nerve.com  the tagline of which was  literate smut.  It was in theory  and hopefully in practice  a smart online magazine about sex and culture. AV  That spawned a dating site. But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble  which we did. And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see. RG  But for us  the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing  which is  of course  relevant  but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. It seems to us that when people start dissembling  people start lying about things  that's when it gets really interesting. That's a subject that we want to dive into. And we've been surprised to find  as young parents  that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex. AV  It's true. So like we said  the early years were really wonderful  but they were also really difficult. And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. We subscribed to a lot of magazines  did our homework  but really everywhere you look around  we were surrounded by images like this. And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. The sun was always streaming in  and our children would never be crying. I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested  and in fact  it was not like that at all. RG  When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at  with these beautiful images  and looked at the scene in our actual living room  it looked a little bit more like this. These are our three sons. And of course  they're not always crying and screaming  but with three boys  there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should. AV  Yes  you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing  and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight. We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way. RG  So today  what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos. And of course  there are many more than four things you can't say about parenting  but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally. So the first  taboo number one  you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. I remember vividly  sitting there in the hospital. We were in the process of giving birth to our first child. AV  We  or I  RG  I'm sorry. Misuse of the pronoun. Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child     AV  Thank you.     and I was there with a catcher's mitt. And I was there with my arms open. The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful  beautiful child  and I remember  as she was approaching me  the voices of friends saying   The moment they put the baby in your hands  you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is  on  an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.  So I was bracing myself for the moment. The baby was coming  and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. And instead  when the baby was placed in my hands  it was an extraordinary moment. This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. And you can see  our eyes were glistening. I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife  with deep  deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. And it was also  of course  surreal. I mean  I had to check the tags and make sure. I was incredulous   Are you sure this is our child   And this was all quite remarkable. But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection  but nothing like what I feel for him now  five years later. And so we've done something here that is heretical. We have charted our love for our child over time. This  as you know  is an act of heresy. You're not allowed to chart love. The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. You're either in love  or you're not in love. You love  or you don't love. And I think the reality is that love is a process  and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent  or inadequate  or what have you. And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience. But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months  maybe their first year  that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion. AV  Well  I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up  because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. But we like to joke  in the first few months of all of our children's lives  this is Uncle Rufus. RG  I'm a very affectionate uncle  very affectionate uncle. AV  Yes  and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line up amongst other babies. So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus. RG  Uh oh. AV  I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds. RG  That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there  is he  AV  Our eight week old son is somewhere in here  and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him. RG  The far left. AV  No  RG  Cruel. AV  Nothing more to be said. I'll move on to taboo number two. You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be. I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. I felt incredibly connected to the community around me. I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy  all around me  tracking it down till the actual due date. I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors. It was a really wonderful experience  but when I got home  I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out  and I was really surprised by those feelings. I did expect it to be difficult  have sleepless nights  constant feedings  but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced  and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me  that I was going to be feeling this way. And I called my sister whom I'm very close to    and had three children    and I asked her   Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way  that I was going to have these    feeling incredibly isolated   And she said    I'll never forget     It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time.  RG  And of course  we think it's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time. And that this  of course  one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents. And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world. So Alisa's experience is not isolated. So your    percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness. Of those     percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five    probably really zero to two. In the process of preparing this  we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time  because here in the Western world  less than    percent of us live near our family members  which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. So to take one example among many  in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari  in which the pregnant woman  when she's seven or eight months pregnant  moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies  give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. AV  So taboo number three  you can't talk about your miscarriage    but today I'll talk about mine. So after we had Declan  we kind of recalibrated our expectations. We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against. And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant  and I soon learned that we were having a boy  and then when I was five months  we learned that we had lost our child. This is actually the last little image we have of him. And it was obviously a very difficult time    really painful. As I was working through that mourning process  I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody. I really wanted to crawl into a hole  and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community. And I realize  I think  the way I was feeling that way  is on a really deep gut level  I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed  frankly  that  in some respects  I had failed at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do. And of course  it made me question  if I wasn't able to have another child  what would that mean for my marriage  and just me as a woman. So it was a very difficult time. As I started working through it more  I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. People I interacted with daily  worked with  was friends with  family members that I had known a long time  had never shared with me their own stories. And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork  and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of  which was reassuring and also really concerning. And I think  miscarriage is an invisible loss. There's not really a lot of community support around it. There's really no ceremony  rituals  or rites. And I think  with a death  you have a funeral  you celebrate the life  and there's a lot of community support  and it's something women don't have with miscarriage. RG  Which is too bad because  of course  it's a very common and very traumatic experience. Fifteen to    percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage  and I find this astounding. In a survey     percent of women said that miscarriage  they felt  was partly their fault  which is awful. And astoundingly     percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse. So taboo number four  you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child. The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. I'll never forget  I remember vividly to this day  our first son  Declan  was nine months old  and I was sitting there on the couch  and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book   Stumbling on Happiness.  And I got about two thirds of the way through  and there was a chart on the right hand side    on the right hand page    that we've labeled here  The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent.  This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. Basically  there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction  which is closely aligned  we all know  with broader happiness  that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life  this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into. We were despondent. AV  So you can imagine  I mean again  the first few months were difficult  but we'd come out of it  and were really shocked to see this study. So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining. RG  And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents  because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. We said  something is wrong here. There's something missing from these studies. It can't possibly be that bad. So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece  and she interviewed four scientists  and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert  and we did indeed find a silver lining. So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. Average happiness is  of course  inadequate  because it doesn't speak to the moment by moment experience  and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment to moment experience. And so we all remember as children  the tiniest little thing    and we see it on the faces of our children    the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation  and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. And it's just extraordinary to watch  and we remember it ourselves. And then  of course  as you get older  it's almost like age is a form of lithium. As you get older  you become more stable. And part of what happens  I think  in your '  s and '  s  is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. You start to realize that  Hey  I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps  but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer. So I'm not going to go. I've got a good stereo at home. So  I'm not going to go.  So your average happiness goes up  but you lose those transcendent moments. AV  Yeah  and then you have your first child  and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows    the highs being the first steps  the first smile  your child reading to you for the first time    the lows being  our house  any time from six to seven every night. But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way  which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying. RG  And so in effect  we trade average happiness. We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this  There's another factor in our case. We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives  and this is a bonus taboo. AV  A quick bonus taboo for you  that we should not be working together  especially with three children    and we are. RG  And we had reservations about this on the front end. Everybody knows  you should absolutely not work with your spouse. In fact  when we first went out to raise money to start Babble  the venture capitalists said   We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives  because there's an extra point of failure. It's a bad idea. Don't do it.  And we obviously went forward. We did. We raised the money  and we're thrilled that we did  because in this phase of one's life  the incredibly scarce resource is time. And if you're really passionate about what you do every day    which we are    and you're also passionate about your relationship  this is the only way we know how to do it. And so the final question that we would ask is  can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards  It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy  but they're sometimes pretty quick. And so how about that average baseline of happiness  Can we move that up a little bit  AV  And we kind of feel that the happiness gap  which we talked about  is really the result of walking into parenting    and really any long term partnership for that matter    with the wrong expectations. And if you have the right expectations and expectation management  we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience. RG  And so this is what    And we think that a lot of parents  when you get in there    in our case anyway    you pack your bags for a trip to Europe  and you're really excited to go. Get out of the airplane  it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience  particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty  but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences  that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit. RG   AV  Thank you. So today I'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption. I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you    in just    minutes    that this isn't a flimsy idea  or a short term trend  but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume  but how we consume. Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example. Hands up    how many of you have books  CDs  DVDs  or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again  but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away  Can't see all the hands  but it looks like all of you  right  On our shelves at home  we have a box set of the DVD series       season six to be precise. I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present. Now my husband  Chris  and I love this show. But let's face it  when you've watched it once maybe  or twice  you don't really want to watch it again  because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us  but with immediate latent value to someone else. Now before we go on  I have a confession to make. I lived in New York for    years  and I am a big fan of  Sex and the City.  Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm up to the sequel coming out next week. So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of      for a wanted copy of  Sex and the City   Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap trading. Now the easiest analogy for swap trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media. What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's  haves  with person C's  wants   whatever they may be. The other week  I went on one of these sites  appropriately called Swaptree  and there were over        items that I could instantly swap for my copy of    .  Lo and behold  there in Reseda  CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her  like new  copy of  Sex and the City  for my copy of    .  So in other words  what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem  a problem the economists call  the coincidence of wants   in approximately    seconds. What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot  because it knows the way of the item. Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree  but that's not my interest  and nor is swap trading  per se. My passion  and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching  is the collaborative behaviors and trust mechanics inherent in these systems. When you think about it  it would have seemed like a crazy idea  even a few years ago  that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands. Yet    percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully  and the one percent that receive a negative rating  it's for relatively minor reasons  like the item didn't arrive on time. So what's happening here  An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play. Namely  that technology is enabling trust between strangers. We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face  but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. So what's actually happening is that social networks and real time technologies are taking us back. We're bartering  trading  swapping  sharing  but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms. What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share  whether that's our neighborhood  our school  our office  or our Facebook network  and that's creating an economy of  what's mine is yours.  From the mighty eBay  the grandfather of exchange marketplaces  to car sharing companies such as GoGet  where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour  to social lending platforms such as Zopa  that will take anyone in this audience with     dollars to lend  and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world  we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. I call this  groundswell collaborative consumption.  Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption  I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked  which is  where did this idea come from  Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said   I'm going to write about collaborative consumption   but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas. Over the next minute  you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head. The first thing I began to notice  how many big concepts were emerging    from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs    around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose. And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world    from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia  and everything in between    on what the power of numbers could achieve. Now  you know when you learn a new word  and then you start to see that word everywhere  That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators  to highly enabled collaborators. What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman  so that anyone from a T shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer to peer. And the ubiquitous force of this peer to peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. I mean  it's amazing to think that  in every single minute of this speech     hours of YouTube video will be loaded. Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts. I mean  we're monkeys  and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. And we were doing so for thousands of years  whether it's when we hunted in packs  or farmed in cooperatives  before this big system called hyper consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. But things are changing  and one of the reasons why is the digital natives  or Gen Y. They're growing up sharing    files  video games  knowledge. It's second nature to them. So we  the millennials    I am just a millennial    are like foot soldiers  moving us from a culture of  me  to a culture of  we.  The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration. We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone  anytime  in real time  from a small device in our hands. All of this was going through my head towards the end of       when  of course  the great financial crash happened. Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists  and he poignantly commented that      is when we hit a wall  when Mother Nature and the market both said   No more.  Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. Yet  it's hard for us to individually know what to do. So all of this is a lot of twittering  right  Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head  until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. One  a renewed belief in the importance of community  and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means. A torrent of peer to peer social networks and real time technologies  fundamentally changing the way we behave. Three  pressing unresolved environmental concerns. And four  a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors. These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift    away from the   th century  defined by hyper consumption  towards the   st century  defined by collaborative consumption. I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors    through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online    are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food  we are consuming and collaborating once again. So my co author  Roo Rogers  and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption. And although they vary enormously in scale  maturity and purpose  when we dived into them  we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. The first is redistribution markets. Redistribution markets  just like Swaptree  are when you take a used  or pre owned  item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere  or someone  where it is. They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R'    reduce  reuse  recycle  repair and redistribute    because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste. The second is collaborative lifestyles. This is the sharing of resources of things like money  skills and time. I bet  in a couple of years  that phrases like  coworking  and  couchsurfing  and  time banks  are going to become a part of everyday vernacular. One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare. It's a scheme in the U.K. that matches Mr. Jones  with some spare space in his back garden  with Mrs. Smith  a would be grower. Together they grow their own food. It's one of those ideas that's so simple  yet brilliant  you wonder why it's never been done before. Now  the third system is product service systems. This is where you pay for the benefit of the product    what it does for you    without needing to own the product outright. This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high idling capacity. And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to    how many of you have a power drill  own a power drill  Right. That power drill will be used around    to    minutes in its entire lifetime. It's kind of ridiculous  right  Because what you need is the hole  not the drill. So why don't you rent the drill  or  even better  rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it  These three systems are coming together  allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles  or their cherished personal freedoms. I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit. So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. The average car costs       dollars a year to run. Yet  that car sits idle for    hours a day. So when you consider these two facts  it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. So this is where car sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in. In       Zipcar took     participants from across    cities    and they're all self confessed car addicts and car sharing rookies    and got them to surrender their keys for a month. Instead  these people had to walk  bike  take the train  or other forms of public transport. They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary. The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. It's amazing that     lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. But my favorite statistic is that     out of the     participants did not want their keys back. In other words  the car addicts had lost their urge to own. Now products service systems have been around for years. Just think of libraries and laundrettes. But I think they're entering a new age  because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun. There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said   Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the   track  what solar power is to the coal mine.  I believe also  our generation  our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. I don't want the DVD  I want the movie it carries. I don't want a clunky answering machine  I want the message it saves. I don't want a CD  I want the music it plays. In other words  I don't want stuff  I want the needs or experiences it fulfills. This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions    or as Kevin Kelly  the editor of Wired magazine  puts it   where access is better than ownership.  Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud  a blurry line is appearing between what's mine  what's yours  and what's ours. I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening. This represents an eight year time span. We've gone from traditional car ownership to car sharing companies  such as Zipcar and GoGet  to ride sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry  which is peer to peer car rental  where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for    hours a day to your neighbor. Now all of these systems require a degree of trust  and the cornerstone to this working is reputation. Now in the old consumer system  our reputation didn't matter so much  because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer to peer review. But now with the Web  we leave a trail. With every spammer we flag  with every idea we post  comment we share  we're actually signaling how well we collaborate  and whether we can or can't be trusted. Let's go back to my first example  Swaptree. I can see that Rondoron has completed     trades with a     percent success rate. In other words  I can trust him or her. Now mark my words  it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital. And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption. It's a new social currency  so to speak  that could become as powerful as our credit rating. Now as a closing thought  I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste  and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. I believe it will be referred to as a revolution  so to speak    when society  faced with great challenges  made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. I'm on a mission to make sharing cool. I'm on a mission to make sharing hip. Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business  help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper consumption and teach us when enough really is enough. Thank you very much. Beverly Joubert  We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness  and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats. And I know  in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change  one would wonder  why worry about a few cats  Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character    this leopard. Dereck Joubert  Well  our lives have basically been like a super long episode of  CSI     something like    years. In essence  what we've done is we've studied the science  we've looked at the behavior  we've seen over       kills by these amazing animals. But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality  that individual personality that these animals have. And here's a prime example. We found this leopard in a       year old baobab tree in Africa  the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us    her own daughter  eight days old. And the minute we found this leopard  we realized that we needed to move in  and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four and a half years    following her every day  getting to know her  that individual personality of hers  and really coming to know her. Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique  very  very special  individualistic and often seductive female characters. Beverly's clearly one of them  and this little leopard  Legadema  is another  and she changed our lives. BJ  Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her    in fact  more time than even her mother did. When her mother would go off hunting  we would stay and film. And early on  a lightning bolt hit a tree    paces away from us. It was frightening  and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. And of course  we were stunned for a while  but when we managed to get our wits about us  we looked at it and said   My gosh  what's going to happen with that little cub  She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us.  Well  we needn't have worried. She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us  sat next to us  shivering  with her back towards Dereck  and looking out. And actually from that day on  she's been comfortable with us. So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. We called her Legadema  which means   light from the sky.  DJ  Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals  in particular in the cats. This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh   he who greets with fire   and you can just see that about him  you know    that's his character. But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have. BJ  But through our investigation  we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Yes  it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent  but I must tell you  every day is exhilarating. But also  our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time  because we're driving through water  and it's an unknown territory. But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats. DJ  Now one of the big things  of course  everybody knows that cats hate water  and so this was a real revelation for us. And we could only find this by pushing ourselves  by going where no sane person should go    not without some prompting  by the way  from Beverly    and just pushing the envelope  going out there  pushing our vehicle  pushing ourselves. But we've managed to find that these lions are    percent bigger than any others  and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water. BJ  And then of course  the challenge is knowing when to turn around. We don't always get that right  and on this particular day  we seriously underestimated the depth. We got deeper and deeper  until it was at Dereck's chest height. Well then we hit a deep depression  and we seriously submerged the vehicle. We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. We drowned our pride  I must tell you  which was really serious  and we seized the engine. DJ  And of course  one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly    the dry top angle  by the way. But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. And it wasn't a moment  and these lions came back towards us  and Beverly was able to get a great photograph. BJ  But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. And    years ago  we did a film called  Eternal Enemies  where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species    lions and hyenas. And surprisingly  it became a cult film. And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare. DJ  It was amazing  because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name  Eetwidomayloh  represents. He's focused on this hyena  and he is going to get it. But that's  I think  what this is all about  is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. But for us to get them  not only do we push ourselves  but we live by certain rules of engagement  which mean we can't interfere. This sort of behavior has been going on for three  four  five million years  and we can't step in and say   That's wrong  and that's right.  But that's not always easy for us. BJ  So  as Dereck says  we have to work through extremes    extreme temperatures  push ourselves at night. Sleep deprivation is extreme. We're on the edge through a large part of the time. But  for    years  we tried to capture lions and elephants together    and never ever managed until this particular night. And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me. I had tears rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking with anxiety  but I knew that  I had  to capture something that had never been seen before  had never been documented. And I do believe you should stay with us. DJ  The amazing thing about these moments    and this is probably a highlight of our career    is that you never know how it's going to end. Many people believe  in fact  that death begins in the eyes  not in the heart  not in the lungs  and that's when people give up hope  or when any life form gives up hope. And you can see the start of it here. This elephant  against overwhelming odds  simply gives up hope. But by the same token  you can get your hope back again. So just when you think it's all over  something else happens  some spark gets into you  some sort of will to fight    that iron will that we all have  that this elephant has  that conservation has  that big cats have. Everything has that will to survive  to fight  to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. And for us  in many ways  this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us  a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work. Now back to the leopard. We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism  her personal character  that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. We were perhaps taking her for granted  and maybe she didn't like that that much. This is about couples working together  and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories  Beverly and I. Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is  and I'm on the other side where my space is. These are precious to us  these divides. BJ  But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear  she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate. It was phenomenal  and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. But at the same time  we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car  it might not turn out the same way    she might get shot for that. So we knew we had to react quickly. And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make    a hiss and a sound. So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car    very innovative. DJ  It was the only way for me to save the marriage  because Beverly felt she was being replaced  you see. But really and truly  this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her  when she started hunting. BJ  And on this first hunt  we truly were excited. It was like watching a graduation ceremony. We felt like we were surrogate parents. And of course  we knew now that she was going to survive. But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. And of course  the baby baboon was so innocent  it didn't turn and run. So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety  protecting it from the hyena. And over the next five hours  she took care of it. We realized that we actually don't know everything  and that nature is so unpredictable  we have to be open at all times. DJ  Okay  so she was a little bit rough. But in fact  what we were seeing here was interesting. Because she is a cub wanting to play  but she was also a predator needing to kill  and yet conflicted in some way  because she was also an emerging mother. She had this maternal instinct  much like a young girl on her way to womanhood  and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality. BJ  And of course  through the night  they lay together. They ended up sleeping for hours. But I have to tell you    everybody always asks   What happened to the baby baboon   It did die  and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights. DJ  So at this stage  I guess  we had very  very firm ideas on what conservation meant. We had to deal with these individual personalities. We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them. And so we  with the National Geographic  formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation  taking care of the big cats that we loved    and then had an opportunity to look back over the last    years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. So when Beverly and I were born  there were         lions  and today there are       . Tigers haven't fared any better           down to maybe      . BJ  And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to       . Leopards have plummeted from         down to a mere       . Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema    which is really over a five year period           leopards were legally shot by safari hunters. And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. There's an immense amount of poaching as well  and so possibly the same amount. It's simply not sustainable. We admire them  and we fear them  and yet  as man  we want to steal their power. It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin  but now throughout rituals and ceremonies  traditional healers and ministers. And of course  looking at this lion paw that has been skinned  it eerily reminds me of a human hand  and that's ironic  because their fate is in our hands. DJ  There's a burgeoning bone trade. South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same  and so in a stroke  the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. So we have a real problem here  no more so than the lions do  the male lions. So the        lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring  because there may be       or       male lions  and they all are actually infected with the same disease. I call it complacency    our complacency. Because there's a sport  there's an activity going on that we're all aware of  that we condone. And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today. BJ  And you have to know that  when a male lion is killed  it completely disrupts the whole pride. A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride  and  of course  first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs. So we've estimated that between     and     lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place. DJ  So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential. They're essential to the habitat. If they disappear  whole ecosystems in Africa disappear. There's an    billion dollar a year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. So this is not just a concern about lions  it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. If they disappear  all of that goes away. But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that  as we de link ourselves from nature  as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals  we lose hope  we lose that spiritual connection  our dignity  that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet. BJ  So you have to know  looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now  it is all about critical awareness. And so what we are doing  in February  we're bringing out a film called  The Last Lion   and  The Last Lion  is exactly what is happening right now. That is the situation we're in    the last lions. That is  if we don't take action and do something  these plains will be completely devoid of big cats  and then  in turn  everything else will disappear. And simply  if we can't protect them  we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well. DJ  And in fact  that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by    that conservation was all about respect and celebration    is probably true. That's really what it needs. We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman  as a community and as part of this planet  and we need to continue that. And Legadema  Well we can report  in fact  that we're grandparents. BJ DJ  Thank you very much. So for any of us in this room today  let's start out by admitting we're lucky. We don't live in the world our mothers lived in  our grandmothers lived in  where career choices for women were so limited. And if you're in this room today  most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights  and amazingly  we still live in a world where some women don't have them. But all that aside  we still have a problem  and it's a real problem. And the problem is this  Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. The numbers tell the story quite clearly.     heads of state    nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world     percent are women. In the corporate sector  women at the top  C level jobs  board seats    tops out at        percent. The numbers have not moved since      and are going in the wrong direction. And even in the non profit world  a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women  women at the top     percent. We also have another problem  which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. A recent study in the U.S. showed that  of married senior managers  two thirds of the married men had children and only one third of the married women had children. A couple of years ago  I was in New York  and I was pitching a deal  and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. And I'm in the meeting    it's about a three hour meeting    and two hours in  there needs to be that bio break  and everyone stands up  and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. So I start looking around for moving boxes  figuring they just moved in  but I don't see any. And so I said   Did you just move into this office   And he said   No  we've been here about a year.  And I said   Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year   And he looked at me  and he said   Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom.  So the question is  how are we going to fix this  How do we change these numbers at the top  How do we make this different  I want to start out by saying  I talk about this    about keeping women in the workforce    because I really think that's the answer. In the high income part of our workforce  in the people who end up at the top    Fortune     CEO jobs  or the equivalent in other industries    the problem  I am convinced  is that women are dropping out. Now people talk about this a lot  and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. I want to talk about none of that today  even though that's all really important. Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. What are the messages we need to tell ourselves  What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us  What are the messages we tell our daughters  Now  at the outset  I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. I don't have the right answer. I don't even have it for myself. I left San Francisco  where I live  on Monday  and I was getting on the plane for this conference. And my daughter  who's three  when I dropped her off at preschool  did that whole hugging the leg  crying   Mommy  don't get on the plane  thing. This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. I know no women  whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce  who don't feel that sometimes. So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone. My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce  and I think there are three. One  sit at the table. Two  make your partner a real partner. And three  don't leave before you leave. Number one  sit at the table. Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook  we hosted a very senior government official  and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. And everyone kind of sat at the table. He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department  and I kind of said to them   Sit at the table. Come on  sit at the table   and they sat on the side of the room. When I was in college  my senior year  I took a course called European Intellectual History. Don't you love that kind of thing from college  I wish I could do that now. And I took it with my roommate  Carrie  who was then a brilliant literary student    and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar    and my brother    smart guy  but a water polo playing pre med  who was a sophomore. The three of us take this class together. And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin  goes to all the lectures. I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. My brother is kind of busy. He reads one book of    and goes to a couple of lectures  marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. The three of us go to the exam together  and we sit down. And we sit there for three hours    and our little blue notebooks    yes  I'm that old. We walk out  we look at each other  and we say   How did you do   And Carrie says   Boy  I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic.  And I say   God  I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow.  And my brother says   I got the top grade in the class.   You got the top grade in the class  You don't know anything.  The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows  women systematically underestimate their own abilities. If you test men and women  and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs  men get it wrong slightly high  and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that    percent of boys entering  or men  I guess  are negotiating their first salary  and only seven percent of women. And most importantly  men attribute their success to themselves  and women attribute it to other external factors. If you ask men why they did a good job  they'll say   I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking   If you ask women why they did a good job  what they'll say is someone helped them  they got lucky  they worked really hard. Why does this matter  Boy  it matters a lot. Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side  not at the table  and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success  or they don't even understand their own success. I wish the answer were easy. I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for  these fabulous women   Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.  I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple. Because what the data shows  above all else  is one thing  which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. And everyone's nodding  because we all know this to be true. There's a really good study that shows this really well. There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley  and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. In         not so long ago    a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it  Howard  Roizen. And he gave the case out  both of them  to two groups of students. He changed exactly one word   Heidi  to  Howard.  But that one word made a really big difference. He then surveyed the students  and the good news was the students  both men and women  thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent  and that's good. The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. He's a great guy. You want to work for him. You want to spend the day fishing with him. But Heidi  Not so sure. She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. You're not sure you'd want to work for her. This is the complication. We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues  we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A  to reach for the promotion  to sit at the table  and we have to do it in a world where  for them  there are sacrifices they will make for that  even though for their brothers  there are not. The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me  but I think important. I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about     employees  and a couple hours later  there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk  and she wanted to talk to me. I said  okay  and she sat down  and we talked. And she said   I learned something today. I learned that I need to keep my hand up.   What do you mean   She said   You're giving this talk  and you said you would take two more questions. I had my hand up with many other people  and you took two more questions. I put my hand down  and I noticed all the women did the same  and then you took more questions  only from the men.  And I thought to myself   Wow  if it's me    who cares about this  obviously    giving this talk    and during this talk  I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised  and the women's hands are still raised  how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women   We've got to get women to sit at the table. Message number two  Make your partner a real partner. I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. The data shows this very clearly. If a woman and a man work full time and have a child  the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does  and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. So she's got three jobs or two jobs  and he's got one. Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more  The causes of this are really complicated  and I don't have time to go into them. And I don't think Sunday football watching and general laziness is the cause. I think the cause is more complicated. I think  as a society  we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers  and it's hard. When I go to the Mommy and Me stuff and I see the father there  I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. And that's a problem  because we have to make it as important a job  because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home  for people of both genders  if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce. Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there  they also have more    how shall I say this on this stage  They know each other more in the biblical sense as well. Message number three  Don't leave before you leave. I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking    and I see this all the time    with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. Here's what happens  We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. And she starts thinking about having a child  and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child  she starts thinking about making room for that child.  How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing   And literally from that moment  she doesn't raise her hand anymore  she doesn't look for a promotion  she doesn't take on the new project  she doesn't say   Me. I want to do that.  She starts leaning back. The problem is that    let's say she got pregnant that day  that day    nine months of pregnancy  three months of maternity leave  six months to catch your breath    Fast forward two years  more often    and as I've seen it    women start thinking about this way earlier    when they get engaged  or married  when they start thinking about having a child  which can take a long time. One woman came to see me about this. She looked a little young. And I said   So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby   And she said   Oh no  I'm not married.  She didn't even have a boyfriend. I said   You're thinking about this just way too early.  But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back  Everyone who's been through this    and I'm here to tell you  once you have a child at home  your job better be really good to go back  because it's hard to leave that kid at home. Your job needs to be challenging. It needs to be rewarding. You need to feel like you're making a difference. And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did  if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities  you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. Don't leave before you leave. Stay in. Keep your foot on the gas pedal  until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child    and then make your decisions. Don't make decisions too far in advance  particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making. My generation really  sadly  is not going to change the numbers at the top. They're just not moving. We are not going to get to where    percent of the population    in my generation  there will not be    percent of  women  at the top of any industry. But I'm hopeful that future generations can. I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women  would be a better world. It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are  even though that would be very helpful. I think it would be a better world. I have two children. I have a five year old son and a two year old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home  and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed  but to be liked for her accomplishments. Thank you. So today  I'm going to tell you about some people who didn't move out of their neighborhoods. The first one is happening right here in Chicago. Brenda Palms Farber was hired to help ex convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison. Currently  taxpayers spend about        dollars per year sending a person to jail. We know that two thirds of them are going to go back. I find it interesting that  for every one dollar we spend  however  on early childhood education  like Head Start  we save    dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future. Or    think about it    that        dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well. But Brenda  not being phased by stuff like that  took a look at her challenge and came up with a not so obvious solution  create a business that produces skin care products from honey. Okay  it might be obvious to some of you  it wasn't to me. It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential. She hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees  harvest the honey and make value added products that they marketed themselves  and that were later sold at Whole Foods. She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed  like anger management and teamwork  and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more. Less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail. So these young men and women learned job readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process. Talk about a sweet beginning. Now  I'm going to take you to Los Angeles  and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues. But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now. They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains. Currently     percent of California's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California. Their spending loads  loads  to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island    linking trees  people and technology to create a more livable city. All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water  also helps cool our cities. Because  come to think about it  do you really want air conditioning  or is it a cooler room that you want  How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference. So a few years ago  L.A. County decided that they needed to spend  .  billion dollars to repair the city schools. And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend     million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves. And by presenting a really strong economic case  they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery  that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure. So ultimately     million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided  and electrical consumption for air conditioning went down  while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up  resulting in a net savings to the system  but also healthier students and schools system employees as well. Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter. Her family has eight generations in a town called Whitesville  West Virginia. And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history  and of the town  it should be Judy. But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people. Now  two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months  and only for about a few years' worth of coal. That kind of technology is called  mountaintop removal.  It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months. Just imagine that the air surrounding these places    it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal. When we visited  it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so    not just miners  but everybody. And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned. And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied  leaving even more unemployment in their wake. But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain  and one that was reduced in elevation by over       feet. Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs  or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills  and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind. She calculated the up front cost and the payback over time  and it's a net plus on so many levels for the local  national and global economy. It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal  but the wind energy actually pays back forever. Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals  and it gives them a lot of misery. The water is turned into goo. Most people are still unemployed  leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience    drug and alcohol abuse  domestic abuse  teen pregnancy and poor heath  as well. Now Judy and I    I have to say    totally related to each other. Not quite an obvious alliance. I mean  literally  her hometown is called Whitesville  West Virginia. I mean  they are not    they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that. But the back of my T shirt  the one that she gave me  says   Save the endangered hillbillies.  So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about. But just a few months ago  Judy was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer. Yeah. And it has since moved to her bones and her brain. And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from. But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy. And she might not get to see that mountaintop. But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something  she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen. That's what my homegirl is doing. So I'm so proud of that. But these three people don't know each other  but they do have an awful lot in common. They're all problem solvers  and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see  meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now. I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org. Now they're all very practical visionaries. They take a look at the demands that are out there    beauty products  healthy schools  electricity    and how the money's flowing to meet those demands. And when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs  you're left with unemployed people  and those people aren't cheap. In fact  they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens  and they include generationally impoverished  traumatized vets returning from the Middle East  people coming out of jail. And for the veterans in particular  the V.A. said there's a six fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since     . I think that number's probably going to go up. They're not the largest number of people  but they are some of the most expensive    and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse  drug and alcohol abuse  poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress. So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands  reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future. And there are plenty of other examples like that. One problem  waste handling and unemployment. Even when we think or talk about recycling  lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities  diversion rates    they leave much to be recycled. And where is this waste handled  Usually in poor communities. And we know that eco industrial business  these kinds of business models    there's a model in Europe called the eco industrial park  where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another  or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell. We can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing. And in my hometown  we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx  but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot. Fortunately    because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs    but after many years  the city wanted to build a jail. They've since abandoned that project  thank goodness. Another problem  unhealthy food systems and unemployment. Working class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system. It relies too much on transportation  chemical fertilization  big use of water and also refrigeration. Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land  and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity. And so we know  urban ag  is a big buzz topic this time of the year  but it's mostly gardening  which has some value in community building    lots of it    but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production. The numbers just aren't there. Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the       mile salad by creating a national brand of urban grown produce in every city  that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities  owned and operated by small growers  where now there are only consumers. This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year round demand for produce. It's not a competition with rural farm  it's actually reinforcements. It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system. The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals  senior centers  schools  daycare centers  and produce a network of regional jobs  as well. This is smart infrastructure. And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well being of people every single day. Our municipalities  rural and urban  play the operational course of infrastructure    things like waste disposal  energy demand  as well as social costs of unemployment  drop out rates  incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. Smart infrastructure can provide cost saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs. And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base. And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability. So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here. These examples indicate a trend. I haven't created it  and it's not happening by accident. I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country  and the good news is that it's growing. And we all need to be invested in it. It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery. And I call it  hometown security.  The recession has us reeling and fearful  and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering. It's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery. Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local. And when we do that  our neighbors    be they next door  or in the next state  or in the next country    will be just fine. The sum of the local is the global. Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses  putting people to work  restoring our natural systems. Hometown security means creating wealth here at home  instead of destroying it overseas. Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings  wealth generation and national security. Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America. The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more. Now  hometown security is about taking care of your own  but it's not like the old saying   charity begins at home.  I recently read a book called  Love Leadership  by John Hope Bryant. And it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear. And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that. See  my dad was a great  great man in many ways. He grew up in the segregated South  escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times  and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times. But  like all of us  he had some problems. And his was gambling  compulsively. To him that phrase   Charity begins at home   meant that my payday    or someone else's    would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. So you need to help him out. And sometimes I would loan him money from my after school or summer jobs  and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest  of course  after he hit it big. And he did sometimes  believe it or not  at a racetrack in Los Angeles    one reason to love L.A.    back in the     s. He made        dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in. So I'm not that unhappy about that. But listen  I did feel obligated to him  and I grew up    then I grew up. And I'm a grown woman now  and I have learned a few things along the way. To me  charity often is just about giving  because you're supposed to  or because it's what you've always done  or it's about giving until it hurts. I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year    I'm not trying to feed the habit. I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment  that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it  actually left people in the same  if not worse  position that they were in before. And over the past    years  we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems  yet educational outcomes  malnutrition  incarceration  obesity  diabetes  income disparity  they've all gone up with some exceptions    in particular  infant mortality among people in poverty    but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well. And I know a little bit about these issues  because  for many years  I spent a long time in the non profit industrial complex  and I'm a recovering executive director  two years clean. But during that time  I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities. But I really did struggle for financial support. The greater our success  the less money came in from foundations. And I tell you  being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived. And by the time I'd moved on  I was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees. And I think because early on  frankly  my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. But since then  the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED     Talk became this little thing. But I did in fact get married in it. Over here. There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding. The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in     . Since then  we got about    million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here. And we love this  because I love construction now  because we're watching these things actually happen. So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise. I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people. Hometown security is next on my to do list. What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises  who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual. We need to work together to embrace and repair our land  repair our power systems and repair ourselves. It's time to stop building the shopping malls  the prisons  the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures. It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility. Thank you very much. So  I'll start with this  a couple years ago  an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called  and she said   I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer.  And I thought   Well  what's the struggle   And she said   Well  I saw you speak  and I'm going to call you a researcher  I think  but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher  no one will come  because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant.  And I was like   Okay.  And she said   But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller.  And of course  the academic  insecure part of me was like   You're going to call me a what   And she said   I'm going to call you a storyteller.  And I was like   Why not 'magic pixie'   I was like   Let me think about this for a second.  I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought  you know  I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories  that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said   You know what  Why don't you just say I'm a researcher storyteller.  And she went   Ha ha. There's no such thing.  So I'm a researcher storyteller  and I'm going to talk to you today    we're talking about expanding perception    and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent. And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher  doctoral student  my first year  I had a research professor who said to us   Here's the thing  if you cannot measure it  it does not exist.  And I thought he was just sweet talking me. I was like   Really   and he was like   Absolutely.  And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work  and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work  so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the  life's messy  love it.  And I'm more of the   life's messy  clean it up  organize it and put it into a bento box.  And so to think that I had found my way  to found a career that takes me    really  one of the big sayings in social work is   Lean into the discomfort of the work.  And I'm like  knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought  you know what  this is the career for me  because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see. So where I started was with connection. Because  by the time you're a social worker for    years  what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice  mental health and abuse and neglect  what we know is that connection  the ability to feel connected  is    neurobiologically that's how we're wired    it's why we're here. So I thought  you know what  I'm going to start with connection. Well  you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss  and she tells you    things that you do really awesome  and one  opportunity for growth   And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth  right  Well  apparently this is the way my work went as well  because  when you ask people about love  they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging  they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection  the stories they told me were about disconnection. So very quickly    really about six weeks into this research    I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought  I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection  Is there something about me that  if other people know it or see it  that I won't be worthy of connection  The things I can tell you about it  It's universal  we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it  and the less you talk about it  the more you have it. What underpinned this shame  this  I'm not good enough      which  we all know that feeling   I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough  rich enough  beautiful enough  smart enough  promoted enough.  The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of  in order for connection to happen  we have to allow ourselves to be seen  really seen. And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought  this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in  I'm going to figure this stuff out  I'm going to spend a year  I'm going to totally deconstruct shame  I'm going to understand how vulnerability works  and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready  and I was really excited. As you know  it's not going to turn out well. You know this. So  I could tell you a lot about shame  but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to    and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. My one year turned into six years  Thousands of stories  hundreds of long interviews  focus groups. At one point  people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories    thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood  this is what shame is  this is how it works. I wrote a book  I published a theory  but something was not okay    and what it was is that  if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness    that's what this comes down to  a sense of worthiness    they have a strong sense of love and belonging    and folks who struggle for it  and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough. There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was  the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me  the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection  was something that  personally and professionally  I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness  where I saw people living that way  and just looked at those. What do these people have in common  I have a slight office supply addiction  but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder  and I had a Sharpie  and I was like  what am I going to call this research  And the first words that came to my mind were  whole hearted.  These are whole hearted people  living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder  and I started looking at the data. In fact  I did it first in a four day  very intensive data analysis  where I went back  pulled the interviews  the stories  pulled the incidents. What's the theme  What's the pattern  My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing  where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode. And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage  the original definition of courage  when it first came into the English language    it's from the Latin word  cor   meaning  heart     and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had  very simply  the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others  because  as it turns out  we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection  and    this was the hard part    as a result of authenticity  they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were  which you have to absolutely do that for connection. The other thing that they had in common was this  They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable  nor did they really talk about it being excruciating    as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say   I love you  first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research  where our job    you know  the definition of research is to control and predict  to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown       which actually looked more like this. And it did. I call it a breakdown  my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown  but I assure you  it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something  you know who you are when you call your friends and say   I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations   Because about five of my friends were like   Wooo  I wouldn't want to be your therapist.  I was like   What does that mean   And they're like   I'm just saying  you know. Don't bring your measuring stick.  I was like   Okay.  So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her  Diana    I brought in my list of the way the whole hearted live  and I sat down. And she said   How are you   And I said   I'm great. I'm okay.  She said   What's going on   And this is a therapist who sees therapists  because we have to go to those  because their B.S. meters are good. And so I said   Here's the thing  I'm struggling.  And she said   What's the struggle   And I said   Well  I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness  but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy  of creativity  of belonging  of love. And I think I have a problem  and I need some help.  And I said   But here's the thing  no family stuff  no childhood shit.   I just need some strategies.  Thank you. So she goes like this. And then I said   It's bad  right   And she said   It's neither good nor bad.   It just is what it is.  And I said   Oh my God  this is going to suck.  And it did  and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that  when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important  that they surrender and walk into it. A  that's not me  and B  I don't even hang out with people like that. For me  it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed  I pushed back. I lost the fight  but probably won my life back. And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they  the whole hearted  what choices they were making  and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much  Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability  No. So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability    when we're waiting for the call. It was funny  I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says   How would you define vulnerability  What makes you feel vulnerable   And within an hour and a half  I had     responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick  and we're newly married  initiating sex with my husband  initiating sex with my wife  being turned down  asking someone out  waiting for the doctor to call back  getting laid off  laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability. And I think there's evidence    and it's not the only reason this evidence exists  but I think it's a huge cause    We are the most in debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is    and I learned this from the research    that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say  here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability  here's grief  here's shame  here's fear  here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God. You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects  our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those  we numb joy  we numb gratitude  we numb happiness. And then  we are miserable  and we are looking for purpose and meaning  and then we feel vulnerable  so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty.  I'm right  you're wrong. Shut up.  That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are  the more vulnerable we are  the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research  A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this  it would be me  but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks. Which just  I hope in     years  people will look back and go   Wow.  And we perfect  most dangerously  our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand  our job is not to say   Look at her  she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect    make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.  That's not our job. Our job is to look and say   You know what  You're imperfect  and you're wired for struggle  but you are worthy of love and belonging.  That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that  and we'll end the problems  I think  that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate    whether it's a bailout  an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies  this is not our first rodeo  people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ...  We're sorry. We'll fix it.  But there's another way  and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found  To let ourselves be seen  deeply seen  vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts  even though there's no guarantee    and that's really hard  and I can tell you as a parent  that's excruciatingly difficult    to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror  when we're wondering   Can I love you this much  Can I believe in this this passionately  Can I be this fierce about this   just to be able to stop and  instead of catastrophizing what might happen  to say   I'm just so grateful  because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.  And the last  which I think is probably the most important  is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place  I believe  that says   I'm enough  ... then we stop screaming and start listening  we're kinder and gentler to the people around us  and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves. That's all I have. Thank you. The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you. The second thing I want to do is introduce my co author and dear friend and co teacher. Ken and I have been working together for almost    years. That's Ken Sharpe over there. So there is among many people    certainly me and most of the people I talk to    a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working  with the way our institutions run. Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them. Our doctors don't know who the hell we are  and they don't have enough time for us. We certainly can't trust the bankers  and we certainly can't trust the brokers. They almost brought the entire financial system down. And even as we do our own work  all too often  we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing  or the required thing  or the profitable thing. So everywhere we look  pretty much across the board  we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. Or if they do have our interests at heart  we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests. They don't understand us. They don't have the time to get to know us. There are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction. If things aren't going right  the first response is  let's make more rules  let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing. Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom  so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids  as long as they follow the scripts  our kids will get educated. Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes  so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment. Instead  all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime. Impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees. More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent  uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with. Or    or maybe and    in addition to rules  let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that  even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests  it is in their interest to serve our interest    the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness. So we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems. Rules and incentives     sticks  and  carrots.  We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse. There's the Dodd Frank Act  there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren. Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. We'll see. In addition  we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long term interests even of their own companies  rather than securing short term profits. So if we find just the right incentives  they'll do the right thing    as I said    selfishly  and if we come up with the right rules and regulations  they won't drive us all over a cliff. And Ken  Sharpe  and I certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers. If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that. But what we believe  and what we argue in the book  is that there is no set of rules  no matter how detailed  no matter how specific  no matter how carefully monitored and enforced  there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. Why  Because bankers are smart people. And  like water  they will find cracks in any set of rules. You design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system  almost collapse  can't happen again. It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse  you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse. So it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that. What we desperately need  beyond  or along with  better rules and reasonably smart incentives  is we need virtue. We need character. We need people who want to do the right thing. And in particular  the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that Aristotle called  practical wisdom.  Practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is. So Aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked. And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems    problems that they hadn't anticipated. So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos  and they need to measure out round columns. Well if you think about it  it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. So what do they do  They fashion a novel solution to the problem. They created a ruler that bends  what we would call these days a tape measure    a flexible rule  a rule that bends. And Aristotle said   Hah  they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns  you need to bend the rule.  And Aristotle said often in dealing with other people  we need to bend the rules. Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass. Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. Wise people know how to improvise. The way my co author   Ken  and I talk about it  they are kind of like jazz musicians. The rules are like the notes on the page  and that gets you started  but then you dance around the notes on the page  coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players. So for Aristotle  the kind of rule bending  rule exception finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. And in interactions with people  almost all the time  it is this kind of flexibility that is required. A wise person knows when to bend the rules. A wise person knows when to improvise. And most important  a wise person does this improvising and rule bending in the service of the right aims. If you are a rule bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself  what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. So it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself. And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception finding. Together they comprise practical wisdom  which Aristotle thought was the master virtue. So I'll give you an example of wise practice in action. It's the case of Michael. Michael's a young guy. He had a pretty low wage job. He was supporting his wife and a child  and the child was going to parochial school. Then he lost his job. He panicked about being able to support his family. One night  he drank a little too much  and he robbed a cab driver    stole    dollars. He robbed him at gunpoint. It was a toy gun. He got caught. He got tried. He got convicted. The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years     months. The judge on the case  Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense. He had never committed a crime before. He was a responsible husband and father. He had been faced with desperate circumstances. All this would do is wreck a family. And so she improvised a sentence       months  and not only that  but release every day to go to work. Spend your night in jail  spend your day holding down a job. He did. He served out his sentence. He made restitution and found himself a new job. And the family was united. And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life    a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. But it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own  and so he appealed. And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery. He did after all have a toy gun. The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years. He won the appeal. Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. Judge Forer had to follow the law. And by the way  this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence  so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail. Judge Forer did what she was required to do  and then she quit the bench. And Michael disappeared. So that is an example  both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant  of course  to make things better. Now consider Ms. Dewey. Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school. She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids  so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. All these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones  and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools. So here was the consultant's advice  first  don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. Second  don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. Third  don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted. Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble  the so called  bubble kids     kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing. So Ms. Dewey heard this  and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly. It's like they were about to go play a football game. For Ms. Dewey  this isn't why she became a teacher. Now Ken and I are not naive  and we understand that you need to have rules. You need to have incentives. People have to make a living. But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity  and they demoralize professional activity in two senses. First  they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity. Judge Forer quits  and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened. And second  they demoralize the activity itself. The very practice is demoralized  and the practitioners are demoralized. It creates people    when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing    it creates people who are addicted to incentives. That is to say  it creates people who only do things for incentives. Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for    years. Psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for    years. We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures  they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward. If you reward kids for reading books  they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are. If you reward teachers for kids' test scores  they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures    which is the current system    they would do more. If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures  they will do fewer. What we want  of course  is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason    namely  to serve the welfare of their patients. Psychologists have known this for decades  and it's time for policymakers to start paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit  instead of economists. And it doesn't have to be this way. We think  Ken and I  that there are real sources of hope. We identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws. These are people who  being forced to operate in a system that demands rule following and creates incentives  find away around the rules  find a way to subvert the rules. So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow  and they know that if they follow these scripts  the kids will learn nothing. And so what they do is they follow the scripts  but they follow the scripts at double time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective. So these are little ordinary  everyday heroes  and they're incredibly admirable  but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down. So canny outlaws are better than nothing  but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time. More hopeful are people we call system changers. These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations  but to transform the system  and we talk about several. One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. Pettengill was a    year old vet who had planned to make the army a career  but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq  and that forced him to take a medical discharge. He was married  he had a third kid on the way  he suffered from PTSD  in addition to the bad back  and recurrent nightmares  and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. He was only able to get part time work because of his back  and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. So he started selling marijuana. He was busted in a drug sweep. His family was kicked out of their apartment  and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids. Under normal sentencing procedures  Judge Russell would have had little choice but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail time as a drug felon. But Judge Russell did have an alternative. And that's because he was in a special court. He was in a court called the Veterans' Court. In the Veterans' Court    this was the first of its kind in the United States. Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court. It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law. And he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging. No one wanted non violent offenders    and especially non violent offenders who were veterans to boot    to be thrown into prison. They wanted to do something about what we all know  namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system. And what the Veterans' Court did  was it treated each criminal as an individual  tried to get inside their problems  tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves  and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made. Stayed with them  followed up on them  made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump. There are now    cities that have Veterans' Courts like this. Why has the idea spread  Well  one reason is that Judge Russell has now seen     vets in his Veterans' Court as of February of this year  and out of      guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison. None. None. Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. So here's is a system changer  and it seems to be catching. There's a banker who created a for profit community bank that encouraged bankers    I know this is hard to believe    encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low income clients. The bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community. Though their loan recipients were high risk by ordinary standards  the default rate was extremely low. The bank was profitable. The bankers stayed with their loan recipients. They didn't make loans and then sell the loans. They serviced the loans. They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments. Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers. Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients  before it turned into an institution that serves only itself. Banking wasn't always this way  and it doesn't have to be this way. So there are examples like this in medicine    doctors at Harvard who are trying to transform medical education  so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy  which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training. And the way they do it is to give third year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year. So the patients are not organ systems  and they're not diseases  they're people  people with lives. And in order to be an effective doctor  you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease. In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth  mentoring of one student by another  of all the students by the doctors  and the result is a generation    we hope    of doctors who do have time for the people they treat. We'll see. So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about. Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission    what Aristotle would have called its proper telos. And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. People want to be allowed to be virtuous. They want to have permission to do the right thing. They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work. Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness  and he was right. There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy  and the two things that jump out in study after study    I know this will come as a shock to all of you    the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. Love  managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part. Work  engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying. If you have that  good close relations with other people  work that's meaningful and fulfilling  you don't much need anything else. Well  to love well and to work well  you need wisdom. Rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend  how to be a good parent  how to be a good spouse  or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher. Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom. Indeed  we argue  there is no substitute for wisdom. And so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self sacrifice on the part of practitioners. In giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing    to do right by others    practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves. Thanks. My big idea is a very  very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us. And my little idea that will do that is sleep. This is a room of type A women. This is a room of sleep deprived women. And I learned the hard way  the value of sleep. Two and a half years ago  I fainted from exhaustion. I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone  I got five stitches on my right eye. And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. And in the course of that  I studied  I met with medical doctors  scientists  and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive  more inspired  more joyful life is getting enough sleep. And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution  this new feminist issue. We are literally going to sleep our way to the top  literally. Because unfortunately for men  sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol. I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before. And I felt like saying to him    but I didn't say it    I felt like saying   You know what  If you had gotten five  this dinner would have been a lot more interesting.  There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one upmanship. Especially here in Washington  if you try to make a breakfast date  and you say   How about eight o'clock   they're likely to tell you   Eight o'clock is too late for me  but that's okay  I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight.  And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive  but the truth is they're not  because we  at the moment  have had brilliant leaders in business  in finance  in politics  making terrible decisions. So a high I.Q. does not mean that you're a good leader  because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic. And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics. In fact  I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters  they might still be around. While all the brothers were busy just being hyper connected       maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg  because she would have woken up from a seven and a half  or eight hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture. So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment  what is good for us on a personal level  what's going to bring more joy  gratitude  effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world. So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us  to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep. Thank you. You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being    virgins  and I promise I will come back to those virgins. But in fact  here in the northwest  we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise  defined    times as  gardens watered by running streams.  Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union  this makes perfect sense to me. But the thing is  how come it's news to most people  I know many well intentioned non Muslims who've begun reading the Koran  but given up  disconcerted by its  otherness.  The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes  yet even he called the Koran  as toilsome reading as I ever undertook  a wearisome  confused jumble.  Part of the problem  I think  is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book    as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach  as though God    and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad    were just another author on the bestseller list. Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote    that is  to misquote. Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the  highlighter version   which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti Muslim Islamophobes. So this past spring  as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad  I realized I needed to read the Koran properly    as properly as I could  that is. My Arabic's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary  so I took four well known translations and decided to read them side by side  verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century Arabic. Now I did have an advantage. My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a Sunni split  and for that I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories  so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers  its frame of reference. I knew enough  that is  to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran    an informed one  an experienced one even  but still an outsider  an agnostic Jew reading some else's holy book. So I read slowly. I'd set aside three weeks for this project  and that  I think  is what is meant by  hubris        because it turned out to be three months. I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are. But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran    that feeling of  I get it now     it would slip away overnight  and I'd come back in the morning wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land  and yet the terrain was very familiar. The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels. So one third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham  Moses  Joseph  Mary  Jesus. God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh    jealously insisting on no other gods. The presence of camels  mountains  desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert. And then there was the language  the rhythmic cadence of it  reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory. And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic. Take the Fatihah  the seven verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined. It's just    words in Arabic  but anywhere from    to    in translation. And yet the more you add  the more seems to go missing. The Arabic has an incantatory  almost hypnotic  quality that begs to be heard rather than read  felt more than analyzed. It wants to be chanted out loud  to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue. So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself  or as Arthur Arberry called his version   an interpretation.  But all is not lost in translation. As the Koran promises  patience is rewarded  and there are many surprises    a degree of environmental awareness  for instance  and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation  unmatched in the Bible. And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men  using the second and third person masculine  the Koran includes women    talking  for instance  of believing men and believing women  honorable men and honorable women. Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers. Yes  it does say that  but in a very specific context  the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden  and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers. Not  You must kill unbelievers in Mecca   but you can  you are allowed to  but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba  and only if they attack you first. And even then    God is merciful  forgiveness is supreme    and so  essentially  better if you don't. This was perhaps the biggest surprise    how flexible the Koran is  at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.  Some of these verses are definite in meaning   it says   and others are ambiguous.  The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities  trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own. Only God knows the true meaning. The phrase  God is subtle  appears again and again  and indeed  the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe. As in  for instance  that little matter of virgins and paradise. Old fashioned Orientalism comes into play here. The word used four times is Houris  rendered as dark eyed maidens with swelling breasts  or as fair  high bosomed virgins. Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word  Houris. Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight. Now this may be a way of saying  pure beings     like in angels    or it may be like the Greek Kouros or K r   an eternal youth. But the truth is nobody really knows  and that's the point. Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be  a new creation in paradise  and that you will be  recreated in a form unknown to you   which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin. And that number    never appears. There are no    virgins in the Koran. That idea only came into being     years later  and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps. Paradise is quite the opposite. It's not virginity  it's fecundity. It's plenty. It's gardens watered by running streams. Thank you. So I am a surgeon who studies creativity  and I have never had a patient tell me that  I really want you to be creative during surgery   and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it. I will say though that  after having done surgery a lot  it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument. And for me  this sort of deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and also to study the science of sound  particularly music. And so I'm going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative. I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University  but also at the National Institute of Health where I was previously. I'm going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments. I'm going to start off by playing a video for you. And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett  who's a well known jazz improviser and probably the most well known  iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level. And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head  and he'll never play it exactly the same way again  and so  as a form of intense creativity  I think this is a great example. And so why don't we go and click the video. It's really a remarkable  awesome thing that happens there. I've always    just as a listener  as just a fan    I listen to that  and I'm just astounded. I think    how can this possibly be  How can the brain generate that much information  that much music  spontaneously  And so I set out with this concept  scientifically  that artistic creativity  it's magical  but it's not magic  meaning that it's a product of the brain. There's not too many brain dead people creating art. And so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product  I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process. And I think there's some sub questions there that I put there. Is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically  And I think that's a good question. And I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music  they're very dense  and when you actually go through them  it's very hard to recognize the music in it. In fact  they seem to be very unmusical entirely and to miss the whole point of the music. And so it brings the second question  Why should scientists study creativity  Maybe we're not the right people to do it. Well it may be  but I will say that  from a scientific perspective    we talked a lot about innovation today    the science of innovation  how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy  and truly  we know very little about how we are able to be creative. And so I think that we're going to see over the next            years a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish. Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process of something like this  complex jazz improvisation  and study it rigorously. And so it gets down to the brain. And so all of us have this remarkable brain  which is poorly understood to say the least. I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers  and I myself  I'm not going to give you many answers today  just ask a lot of questions. And fundamentally that's what I do in my lab. I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this. This is the main method that I use. This is called functional MRI. If you've been in an MRI scanner  it's very much the same  but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain  but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain. Now the way that's done is by the following. There's something called BOLD imaging  which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging. Now when you're in an fMRI scanner  you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas. When an area of the brain is active  meaning a neural area is active  it gets blood flow shunted to that area. That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration. Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI  whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. So through this method of inference    and we're measuring blood flow  not neural activity    we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood was active during a particular task  and that's the crux of how fMRI works. And it's been used since the '  s to study really complex processes. Now I'm going to review a study that I did  which was jazz in an fMRI scanner. And this was done with a colleague of mine  Alan Braun  at the NIH. This is a short video of how we did this project. that we use for the jazz experiments. And it's a    key keyboard that is designed to fit both inside the scanner  be magnetically safe  have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs while they're lying down in the scanner  playing on their back. And it works like this    this doesn't actually produce any sound. It sends out what's called a MIDI signal    or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface    through these wires into the box and then the computer  which then trigger high quality piano samples like this. CL  Okay  so it works. And so through this piano keyboard  we now have the means to take a musical process and study it. So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard  You can't just sort of     It's great we've got this keyboard.  We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment. And so the experiment really rests on the following  What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over learned  and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated  or improvised  in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower level sensory motor features  And so  I have here what we call the  paradigms.  There's a scale paradigm  which is just playing a scale up and down  memorized. And then there's improvising on a scale    quarter notes  metronome  right hand    scientifically very safe  but musically really boring. And then there's the bottom one  which is called the jazz paradigm. And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH  and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left  the lower left    which is what you heard me playing    and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes. And if you can hit that lower right sound icon  that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner. So in the end  it's not the most natural environment  but they're able to play real music. And I've listened to that solo     times  and I still like it. And the musicians  they were comfortable in the end. And so we first measured the number of notes. Were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising  That was not what was going on. And then we looked at the brain activity. I'm going to try to condense this for you. These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising versus when you're doing something memorized. In red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex  the frontal lobe of the brain  and in blue is this area that was deactivated. And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity. We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity  and I'll summarize that for you here. Now these are multifunctional areas of the brain. As I like to say  these are not the  jazz areas  of the brain. They do a whole host of things that have to do with self reflection  introspection  working memory and so forth. Really  consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe. But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self monitoring  turning off  and this area that's thought to be autobiographical  or self expressive  turning on. And we think  at least in this preliminary    it's one study  it's probably wrong  but it's one study    we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that  to be creative  you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe. One area turns on  and a big area shuts off  so that you're not inhibited  so that you're willing to make mistakes  so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses. Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity    sometimes it's done communicatively. And so the next question was  What happens when musicians are trading back and forth  something called  trading fours   which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment  So this is a twelve bar blues. And I've broken it down into four bar groups here  so you would know how you would trade. Now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner    same way    had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively. So this is a musician  Mike Pope  one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player. So he's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than I wrote it. Nurse  Nothing's in your pockets  right Mike  MP  Nope. Nothing's in my pockets. Nurse  Okay. CL  You have to have the right attitude to agree to it. It's kind of fun actually. And so now we're playing back and forth. He's in there. You can see his legs up there. And then I'm in the control room here  playing back and forth. of what it's like. And it's good that it's not too quick. The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings. So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing  of looking at my hands through two mirrors  laying on my back and not able to move at all except for my hand. That was challenging. But again  there were moments  for sure  there were moments of real  honest to God musical interplay  for sure. CL  At this point  I'll take a few moments. And so what you're seeing here    and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science  which is to show you preliminary data. This is one subject's data. This is  in fact  Mike Pope's data. So what am I showing you here  When he was trading fours with me  improvising versus memorized  his language areas lit up  his Broca's area  which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left. He actually had it also homologous on the right. This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication. This whole notion that music is a language    well maybe there's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all  and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation. And so we've done this actually on eight subjects now  and we're just getting all the data together  so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully. Now when I think about improvisation and the language  well what's next  Rap  of course  rap    free style. And so I've always been fascinated by free style. And let's go ahead and play this video here.   Rockin' it when I be  in your vicinity     Whole style synergy  recognize symmetry     Go and try to injure me  broke 'em down chemically     Ain't the number    MC  talk about how been I be     Styled it like Kennedy  late like a    to three     When I say when I be  girls say bend that key cut   CL  And so there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in free style rap and jazz. There are  in fact  a lot of correlations between the two forms of music I think in different time periods. In a lot a ways  rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve. So how do you study rap scientifically  And my colleagues kind of think I'm crazy  but I think it's very viable. And so this is what you do  you have a free style artist come in and memorize a rap that you write for them  that they've never heard before  and then you have them free style. So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED  and they said   No  you won't.  And then I thought    But here's the thing. With this big screen  you can all rap with me. Okay  So what we had them do was memorize this lower left sound icon  please. This is the control condition. This is what they memorized. Computer    Memory  thump.   CL    Thump of the beat in a known repeat     Rhythm and rhyme  they make me complete     The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic     Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike     I search for the truth in this eternal quest     My passion's not fashion  you can see how I'm dressed     Psychopathic words in my head appear     Whisper these lyrics only I can hear     The art of discovering and that which is hovering     Inside the mind of those unconfined     All of these words keep pouring out like rain     I need a mad scientist to check my brain   I guarantee you that will never happen again. So now  what's great about these free stylers  they will get cued different words. They don't know what's coming  but they'll hear something off the cuff. Go ahead and hit that right sound icon. They are going to be cued these three square words   like    not  and  head.  He doesn't know what's coming. Free styler    I'm like some kind of  unclear       unclear  extraterrestrial  celestial scene     Back in the days  I used to sit in pyramids and meditate     With two microphones hovering over my head     See if I could still listen  spittin' off the sound     See what you grinning     I teach the children in the back of the classroom     About the message of apocalyptical     Not really though  'cause I've got to keep it simple      unclear  instrumental     Detrimental playing Super Mario      unclear  boxes  unclear  hip hop   CL  So again  it's an incredible thing that's taking place. It's doing something that  neurologically  is remarkable. Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant. Creatively speaking  it's just a phenomenal thing. This is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner. CL  That was recorded in the scanner  by the way. He's just memorized a rhyme for us. Emmanuel    Top of the beat with no repeat     Rhythm and rhyme make me complete     Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic     Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike     I search for the truth in this eternal quest     I'm passing on fashion  you can see how I'm dressed   CL  Okay. So I'm going to stop that there. So what do we see in his brain  Well  this is actually four rappers' brains. And what we see  we do see language areas lighting up  but then    eyes closed    when you are free styling versus memorizing  you've got major visual areas lighting up. You've got major cerebellar activity  which is involved in motor coordination. You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task  when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized. It's very preliminary  but I think it's kind of cool. So just to conclude  we've got a lot of questions to ask  and like I said  we'll ask questions here  not answer them. But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius  neurologically  and I think  with these methods  we're getting close to being there. And I think hopefully in the next        years you'll actually see real  meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art  and maybe we're starting now to get there. And so I want to thank you for your time. I appreciate it. There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography    women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all. Do you know which group you're in  If you don't  you're not alone. Because the breast has become are very political organ. The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press  politicians  radiologists and medical imaging companies. I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth. But first  my disclosures. I am not a breast cancer survivor. I'm not a radiologist. I don't have any patents  and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company  and I am not seeking your vote. What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about    years ago when a patient asked me a question. She came to see me after discovering a breast lump. Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her   s. She and I were both very pregnant at that time  and my heart just ached for her  imagining how afraid she must be. Fortunately  her lump proved to be benign. But she asked me a question  how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one  So I studied her mammogram  and I reviewed the radiology literature  and I was shocked to discover that  in her case  our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin. You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their   s. Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force  even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies. It took the Senate just    days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage. Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines. The pre eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post. The radiologists were  in turn  criticized for protecting their own financial self interest. But in my view  the radiologists are heroes. There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms  and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret  and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause. But that very fact is telling. Where there is this much legal smoke  there is likely to be some fire. The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density. Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat    pictured here in yellow    versus connective and epithelial tissues    pictured in pink. And that proportion is primarily genetically determined. Two thirds of women in their   s have dense breast tissue  which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them. And although breast density generally declines with age  up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause. So how do you know if your breasts are dense  Well  you need to read the details of your mammography report. Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram. If the breast is less than    percent dense  that's called fatty replaced. The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities  followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense. And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense. The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing. Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram  and the X ray often can't distinguish between the two. So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast. But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast. That's why mammograms find over    percent of tumors in fatty breasts  but as few as    percent in extremely dense breasts. Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer  but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer. It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer. At the time my patient posed this question to me  breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature  and very few women having mammograms  or the physicians ordering them  knew about this. But what else could I offer her  Mammograms have been around since the     's  and it's changed very little. There have been surprisingly few innovations  until digital mammography was approved in     . Digital mammography is still an X ray of the breast  but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally  just like we can with a digital camera. The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment  and what have we gained from that investment  In a study funded by over    million taxpayer dollars  digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography  and in fact  it was worse in older women. But it was better in one group  and that was women under    who were pre menopausal and had dense breasts  and in those women  digital mammography found twice as many cancers  but it still only found    percent. So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment  but it's been a very small step forward for womankind. What about ultrasound  Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies  so it's not widely used. And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors  but it's also very expensive. If we think about disruptive technology  we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive. Think about iPods compared to stereos. But it's the exact opposite in health care. The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive. Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer. It's just way too much equipment. One MRI scan costs    times what a digital mammogram costs. And sooner or later  we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price. Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation  and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius. Rather  big ideas can be orchestrated  if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about. It's like the essence of TED. He quotes one innovator who says   The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick.  This makes no sense  because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions. And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems. Now  take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article  and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers. So if you will allow me a little creative license  I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution. Shortly after her visit  I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner  who was a specialist in cardiac imaging  something I had nothing to do with. And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel  where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart  and it had even been tried to image the breast. But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge  bulky tubes  and they were filled with these scintillating crystals  and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. But the potential advantage was that gamma rays  unlike X rays  are not influenced by breast density. But this technology could not find tumors when they're small  and finding a small tumor is critical for survival. If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter  survival exceeds    percent  but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases. But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen  and this is it. It's made not of a bulky tube  but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector. And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density  and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors. So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape       Michael hacked off the X ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out  and we attached the new detector  and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging  or MBI. This is an image from our first patient. And you can see  using the old gamma technology  that it just looked like noise. But using our new detector  we could begin to see the outline of a tumor. So here we were  a nuclear physicist  an internist  soon joined by Carrie Hruska  a biomedical engineer  and two radiologists  and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape. To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement  but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system. This is our current detector. And you can see that it looks a lot different. The duct tape is gone  and we added a second detector on top of the breast  which has further improved our tumor detection. So how does this work  The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells  but not by normal cells  and this is the key difference from mammography. Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue  and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast. But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors  and therefore  it's impervious to breast density. After the injection  the patient's breast is placed between the detectors. And if you've ever had a mammogram    if you're old enough to have had a mammogram    you know what comes next  pain. You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law  and the law requires that the equivalent of a    pound car battery come down on your breast during this study. But with MBI  we use just light  pain free compression. And the detector then transmits the image to the computer. So here's an example. You can see  on the right  a mammogram showing a faint tumor  the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue. But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly  as well as a second tumor  which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. In this example  although the mammogram found one tumor  we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors    one is small as three millimeters. Our big break came in     . After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors  we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study       women with dense breasts  comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI. Of the tumors that we found  mammography found only    percent of those tumors. MBI found    percent. Here's an example from that screening study. The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue  but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake  which correlated with a two centimeter tumor. In this case  a one centimeter tumor. And in this case  a    year old medical secretary at Mayo  who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young  wanted to enroll in our study. And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue  but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake  which we can also see on a color image. And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball. But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes. So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast  we had to solve one very important problem. We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose  and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this. And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram. And at this low dose  we're continuing this screening study  and this image from three weeks ago in a    year old woman shows a normal digital mammogram  but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. So this is not just young women that it's benefiting. It's also older women with dense tissue. And we're now routinely using one fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology. MBI generates four images per breast. MRI generates over a thousand. It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding. But I suspect even the non radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image. But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive    it's as accurate as MRI  it's far less complex to interpret  and it's a fraction of the cost. But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast imaging world who prefer the status quo. After achieving what we felt were remarkable results  our manuscript was rejected by four journals. After the fourth rejection  we requested reconsideration of the manuscript  because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology. We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose  and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions  and this could take five or more years. If this technology is widely adopted  I will not benefit financially in any way  and that is very important to me  because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth. But I recognize    I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science. The MBI unit has now been FDA approved  but it's not yet widely available. So until something is available for women with dense breasts  there are things that you should know to protect yourself. First  know your density. Ninety percent of women don't  and    percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk. The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram. I was at a conference of        people in breast imaging last week in Chicago  and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is. Of course we should. And if you don't know  please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report. Second  if you're pre menopausal  try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle  when breast density is relatively lower. Third  if you notice a persistent change in your breast  insist on additional imaging. And fourth and most important  the mammography debate will rage on  but I do believe that all women    and older should have an annual mammogram. Mammography isn't perfect  but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer. But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation. Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later  and most women  thankfully  survive. So it takes    or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer. Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim. It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations. We need to individualize screening based on density. For women without dense breasts  mammography is the best choice. But for women with dense breasts  we shouldn't abandon screening altogether  we need to offer them something better. The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school  and the answer has been so slow to come. She's given me her blessing to share this story with you. After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer  she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy. We can and must do better  not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters  but in time for you. Thank you. So the Awesome story  It begins about    years ago  when my mom and my dad came to Canada. My mom left Nairobi  Kenya. My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar  India. And they got here in the late     s. They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto  and they settled into a new life. They saw their first dentist  they ate their first hamburger  and they had their first kids. My sister and I grew up here  and we had quiet  happy childhoods. We had close family  good friends  a quiet street. We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up    things like power always on in our houses  things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard. We grew up  and we grew older. I went to high school. I graduated. I moved out of the house  I got a job  I found a girl  I settled down    and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song    but life was pretty good. Life was pretty good.      was a great year. Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario  I got married  surrounded by     family and friends.      was a great year. I graduated from school  and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends. Here's a picture of me and my friend  Chris  on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. We actually saw seals out of our car window  and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads. So you can't actually see them  but it was breathtaking  believe me.      and      were a little tougher. I know that they were tougher for a lot of people  not just me. First of all  the news was so heavy. It's still heavy now  and it was heavy before that  but when you flipped open a newspaper  when you turned on the TV  it was about ice caps melting  wars going on around the world  earthquakes  hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse  and then eventually did collapse  and so many of us losing our homes  or our jobs  or our retirements  or our livelihoods.            were heavy years for me for another reason  too. I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. My marriage wasn't going well  and we just were growing further and further apart. One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage  through a lot of tears  to have a very honest conversation. And she said   I don't love you anymore   and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard  until only a month later  when I heard something even more heartbreaking. My friend Chris  who I just showed you a picture of  had been battling mental illness for some time. And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness  you know how challenging it can be. I spoke to him on the phone at       p.m. on a Sunday night. We talked about the TV show we watched that evening. And Monday morning  I found out that he disappeared. Very sadly  he took his own life. And it was a really heavy time. And as these dark clouds were circling me  and I was finding it really  really difficult to think of anything good  I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow. So I came home from work one night  and I logged onto the computer  and I started up a tiny website called     awesomethings.com. I was trying to remind myself of the simple  universal  little pleasures that we all love  but we just don't talk about enough    things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking  being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding  wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer  or when cashiers open up a new check out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line    even if you were last at the other line  swoop right in there. And slowly over time  I started putting myself in a better mood. I mean         blogs are started a day  and so my blog was just one of those       . And nobody read it except for my mom. Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by     percent when she forwarded it to my dad. And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits  and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions. It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And then I got a phone call  and the voice at the other end of the line said   You've just won the Best Blog In the World award.  I was like  that sounds totally fake. Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to  But it turns out  I jumped on a plane  and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart. And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog. And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto  when  in my inbox     literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book. Flash forward to the next year and  The Book of Awesome  has now been number one on the bestseller list for    straight weeks. But look  I said I wanted to do three things with you today. I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story  I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome  and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought. So let's talk about those three As. Over the last few years  I haven't had that much time to really think. But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself   What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website  but also grow myself   And I've summarized those things  for me personally  as three As. They are Attitude  Awareness and Authenticity. I'd love to just talk about each one briefly. So Attitude  Look  we're all going to get lumps  and we're all going to get bumps. None of us can predict the future  but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan. We will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages  father daughter dances at weddings and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room  but between those high highs  we may also have some lumps and some bumps too. It's sad  and it's not pleasant to talk about  but your husband might leave you  your girlfriend could cheat  your headaches might be more serious than you thought  or your dog could get hit by a car on the street. It's not a happy thought  but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes. Your mom could get cancer  your dad could get mean. And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well  too  with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart  and when that bad news washes over you  and when that pain sponges and soaks in  I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices. One  you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever  or two  you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes. Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two  and choosing  no matter how difficult it is  no matter what pain hits you  choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future. The second  A  is Awareness. I love hanging out with three year olds. I love the way that they see the world  because they're seeing the world for the first time. I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk. I love the way that they'll stare slack jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand  soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs. I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner. I love the way that they see the world  because they're seeing the world for the first time. Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year old. Because you all used to be three years old. That three year old boy is still part of you. That three year old girl is still part of you. They're in there. And being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once  too. So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work. There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air  or the first time you pulled a    dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said   Found money.  The last  A  is Authenticity. And for this one  I want to tell you a quick story. Let's go all the way back to      when  on a peanut farm in Georgia  a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born. Roosevelt Grier  or Rosey Grier  as people used to call him  grew up and grew into a     pound  six foot five linebacker in the NFL. He's number    in the picture. Here he is pictured with the  fearsome foursome.  These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the     s you did not want to go up against. They were tough football players doing what they love  which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field. But Rosey Grier also had another passion. In his deeply authentic self  he also loved needlepoint.  Laughter  He loved knitting. He said that it calmed him down  it relaxed him  it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks. That's what he said. I mean  he loved it so much that  after he retired from the NFL  he started joining clubs. And he even put out a book called  Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men.  It's a great cover. If you notice  he's actually needlepointing his own face. And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person  and that's what authenticity is all about. It's just about being you and being cool with that. And I think when you're authentic  you end up following your heart  and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy. You meet people that you like talking to. You go places you've dreamt about. And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled. So those are the three A's. For the closing thought  I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada. I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid   s. I don't know  because I never did it  but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude. I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world. And I think you'd have to be really authentic  you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to. I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about    seconds right now  because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this  and my parents are sitting in the front row. So I wanted to ask them to  if they don't mind  stand up. And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys. When I was growing up  my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada. And it's a great story  because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport  and he was welcomed by a non profit group  which I'm sure someone in this room runs. And this non profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada. And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread. There was bread  there was those little  mini dill pickles  there was olives  those little white onions. There was rolled up turkey cold cuts  rolled up ham cold cuts  rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese. There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches. There was lasagna  there was casseroles  there was brownies  there was butter tarts  and there was pies  lots and lots of pies. And when my dad tells the story  he says   The craziest thing was  I'd never seen any of that before  except bread. I didn't know what was meat  what was vegetarian. I was eating olives with pie. I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here.  When I was five years old  my dad used to take me grocery shopping  and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. He would say   Look  can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico  They've got an apple here from South Africa. Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco   He's like   Do you know where Morocco even is   And I'd say   I'm five. I don't even know where I am. Is this A P   And he'd say   I don't know where Morocco is either  but let's find out.  And so we'd buy the date  and we'd go home. And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf  and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country. And when we did  my dad would say   Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there  picked this thing off it  put it in a truck  drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house  so they could sell it to us for    cents   And I'd say   I don't believe that.  And he's like   I don't believe it either. Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about.  When I stop to think about it  he's absolutely right. There are so many things to be happy about. We are the only species on the only life giving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen  capable of experiencing so many of these things. I mean  we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture. We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy. We've got airplanes  highway lanes  interior design and horoscope signs. We've got fashion magazines  house party scenes. You can watch a horror movie with monsters. You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming. We've got books  buffets and radio waves  wedding brides and rollercoaster rides. You can sleep in clean sheets. You can go to the movies and get good seats. You can smell bakery air  walk around with rain hair  pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap. We've got all that  but we've only got     years to enjoy it. And that's the sad part. The cashiers at your grocery store  the foreman at your plant  the guy tailgating you home on the highway  the telemarketer calling you during dinner  every teacher you've ever had  everyone that's ever woken up beside you  every politician in every country  every actor in every movie  every single person in your family  everyone you love  everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet. And that moment is right now  and those moments are counting down  and those moments are always  always  always fleeting. You will never be as young as you are right now. And that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude  choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow  living with a sense of awareness of the world around you  embracing your inner three year old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself  being you and being cool with that  letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you  then I think you'll live a life that is rich and is satisfying  and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome. Thank you. I'm actually here to make a challenge to people. I know there have been many challenges made to people. The one I'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means. Peace is not  Kumbaya  my Lord.  Peace is not the dove and the rainbow    as lovely as they are. When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove  I think of personal serenity. I think of meditation. I do not think about what I consider to be peace  which is sustainable peace with justice and equality. It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives  where these people have enough access to education and health care  so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear. This is called human security. And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really  really heavy duty  non violent friends  like Mairead McGuire. I understand that humans are so  messed up     to use a nice word  because I promised my mom I'd stop using the F bomb in public. And I'm trying harder and harder. Mom  I'm really trying. We need a little bit of police  we need a little bit of military  but for defense. We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world. It is not arming our country to the teeth. It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them. It is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure  to make the people of the world secure. I was thinking about the recent ongoings in Congress  where the president is offering  .  billion dollars to try to get the START vote. I certainly support the START vote. But he's offering    billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons. Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is    billion dollars  Just that little bit of money  which to me  I wish it was in my bank account    it's not  but ... In global terms  it's a little bit of money. But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime  unless we get up off our ... and take action to make it happen  unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security. It is saving the tigers. It is stopping the tar sands. It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer. It is all of those things. It is using our money for all of those things. It is about action. I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago  and His Holiness    we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city  and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates. And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church. We're staring at everybody  waiting our turn to speak  and he leans over to me  and he says   Jody  I'm a Buddhist monk.  I said   Yes  Your Holiness. Your robe gives it away.  He said   You know that I kind of like meditation  and I pray.  I said   That's good. That's good. We need that in the world. I don't follow that  but that's cool.  And he says   But I have become skeptical. I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world. I think what we need is action.  His Holiness  in his robes  is my new action hero. I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago. As most of you know  she's a hero for democracy in her country  Burma. You probably also know that she has spent    of the last    years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy. She was just released a couple of weeks ago  and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free  because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon  agitating for change. She is already out in the streets  working with the party to try to rebuild it. But I talked to her for a range of issues. But one thing that I want to say  because it's similar to what His Holiness said. She said   You know  we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country. But I don't believe in hope without endeavor. I don't believe in the hope of change  unless we take action to make it so.  Here's another woman hero of mine. She's my friend  Dr. Shirin Ebadi  the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. She has been in exile for the last year and a half. You ask her where she lives    where does she live in exile  She says the airports of the world. She is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections. And instead of going home  she conferred with all the other women that she works with  who said to her   Stay out. We need you out. We need to be able to talk to you out there  so that you can give the message of what's happening here.  A year and a half    she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country. Wangari Maathai         Peace laureate. They call her the  Tree Lady   but she's more than the Tree Lady. Working for peace is very creative. It's hard work every day. When she was planting those trees  I don't think most people understand that  at the same time  she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country. People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail. But if they were together planting trees for the environment  it was okay    creativity. But it's not just iconic women like Shirin  like Aung Sun Suu Kyi  like Wangari Maathai    it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world. The Women's League of Burma     individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there's strength in numbers. Working together is what changes our world. The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together to change human rights  to bring democracy to that country. When one is arrested and taken to prison  another one comes out and joins the movement  recognizing that if they work together  they will ultimately bring change in their own country. Mairead McGuire in the middle  Betty Williams on the right hand side    bringing peace to Northern Ireland. I'll tell you the quick story. An IRA driver was shot  and his car plowed into people on the side of the street. There was a mother and three children. The children were killed on the spot. It was Mairead's sister. Instead of giving in to grief  depression  defeat in the face of that violence  Mairead hooked up with Betty    a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic    and they took to the streets to say   No more violence.  And they were able to get tens of thousands of  primarily  women  some men  in the streets to bring about change. And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland  and they're still working on it  because there's still a lot more to do. This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum. She also received the Peace Prize. She is now running for president. She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy  about how you bring democracy to the country  about educating  about how to vote    but that democracy is not just about voting  it's about being an active citizen. That's what I got stuck doing    the landmine campaign. One of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two NGOs to thousands in    countries around the world  working together in common cause to ban landmines. Some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month. They could maybe volunteer that much. There were others  like myself  who were full time. But it was the actions  together  of all of us that brought about that change. In my view  what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace. It's not a dirty word. It's hard work every single day. And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could  we would change this world  we would save this world. And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves. Thank you. I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs  but not the cyborgs that you think. You're not RoboCop  and you're not Terminator  but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. So what's a good definition for cyborg  Well  traditional definition is  an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments.  That came from a      paper on space travel  because  if you think about it  space is pretty awkward. People aren't supposed to be there. But humans are curious  and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next. So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. Somebody goes to another country  says   How fascinating these people are  how interesting their tools are  how curious their culture is.  And then they write a paper  and maybe a few other anthropologists read it  and we think it's very exotic. Well  what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. I  as a cyborg anthropologist  have suddenly said   Oh  wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens  and look at these fascinating cultures  and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. They're clicking on things and staring at screens.  Now there's a reason why I study this  versus traditional anthropology. And the reason is that tool use  in the beginning    for thousands and thousands of years  everything has been a physical modification of self. It has helped us to extend our physical selves  go faster  hit things harder  and there's been a limit on that. But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self  but an extension of the mental self  and because of that  we're able to travel faster  communicate differently. And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology. We can put anything we want into it  and it doesn't get heavier  and then we can take anything out. What does the inside of your computer actually look like  Well  if you print it out  it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. And if you actually lose that information  it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind  that you suddenly feel like something's missing  except you aren't able to see it  so it feels like a very strange emotion. The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. Whether you like it or not  you're starting to show up online  and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open  which is basically your Facebook wall  so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night    because it's very much the equivalent. And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self. You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. So  in the same way that you wake up  take a shower and get dressed  you have to learn to do that for your digital self. And the problem is that a lot of people now  especially adolescents  have to go through two adolescences. They have to go through their primary one  that's already awkward  and then they go through their second self's adolescence  and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online. And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now  and so it's very awkward  and it's very difficult for them to do those things. So when I was little  my dad would sit me down at night and he would say   I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future.  And I said   Great.  And he said one day   What's the shortest distance between two points   And I said   Well  that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday.  I thought I was very clever. He said   No  no  no. Here's a better way.  He took a piece of paper  drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched. And he said   That is the shortest distance between two points.  And I said   Dad  dad  dad  how do you do that   He said   Well  you just bend time and space  it takes an awful lot of energy  and that's just how you do it.  And I said   I want to do that.  And he said   Well  okay.  And so  when I went to sleep for the next    or    years  I was thinking at night   I want to be the first person to create a wormhole  to make things accelerate faster. And I want to make a time machine.  I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders. But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. So I started studying anthropology. And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones  I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets. They weren't physically transporting themselves  they were mentally transporting themselves. They would click on a button  and they would be connected as A to B immediately. And I thought   Oh  wow. I found it. This is great.  So over time  time and space have compressed because of this. You can stand on one side of the world  whisper something and be heard on the other. One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use. Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. And because of that  you start to dig around for your external memories    where did you leave them  So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. And that incites a sort of panic architecture     Oh no  where's this thing   We're all  I Love Lucy  on a great assembly line of information  and we can't keep up. And so what happens is  when we bring all that into the social space  we end up checking our phones all the time. So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. It's not that we're always connected to everybody  but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone  the room would be very crowded. These are the people that you have access to right now  in general    all of these people  all of your friends and family that you can connect to. And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore  and that they aren't slowing down and stopping  being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces  paleontology and panic architecture. They're not just sitting there. And really  when you have no external input  that is a time when there is a creation of self  when you can do long term planning  when you can try and figure out who you really are. And then  once you do that  you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way  instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in    and oh  I have to do this  and I have to do this  and I have to do this. And so this is very important. I'm really worried that  especially kids today  they're not going to be dealing with this down time  that they have an instantaneous button clicking culture  and that everything comes to them  and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it. So if you think about it  the world hasn't stopped either. It has its own external prosthetic devices  and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. But when you actually visualize it  all the connections that we're doing right now    this is an image of the mapping of the Internet    it doesn't look technological. It actually looks very organic. This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way. And it's not that machines are taking over. It's that they're helping us to be more human  helping us to connect with each other. The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. And really  it ends up being more human than technology  because we're co creating each other all the time. And so this is the important point that I like to study  that things are beautiful  that it's still a human connection    it's just done in a different way. We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other  regardless of geography. So that's why I study cyborg anthropology. Thank you. If we look around us  much of what surrounds us started life as various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world. But  of course  they don't look like rocks and sludge now. They look like TV cameras  monitors  annoying radio mics. And so this magical transformation is what I was trying to get at with my project  which became known as the Toaster Project. And it was also inspired by this quote from Douglas Adams  and the situation is from  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  And the situation it describes is the hero of the book    he's a   th century man    finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people. And he kind of assumes that  yes  he'll become    these villagers    he'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements  but  of course  realizes that without the rest of human society  he can barely make a sandwich  let alone a toaster. But he didn't have Wikipedia. So I thought  okay  I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. And  working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse engineer  I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find  took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that  inside this object  which I'd bought for just  .   pounds  there were     different bits made out of a hundred plus different materials. I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project. I had maybe nine months. So I thought  okay  I'll start with five. And these were steel  mica  plastic  copper and nickel. So  starting with steel  how do you make steel  I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said   How do you make steel   And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. And my vague rememberings from GCSE science    well  steel comes from iron  so I phoned up an iron mine. And said   Hi  I'm trying to make a toaster. Can I come up and get some iron   Unfortunately  when I got there    emerges Ray. He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster  and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines. But after some nagging  I got him to do that. and that was produced by sea creatures     million years ago in a nice  warm  sunny atmosphere. When you study geology  you can see what's happened in the past  and there were terrific changes in the earth. Thomas Thwaites  As you can see  they had the Christmas decorations up. And of course  it wasn't actually a working mine anymore  because  though Ray was a miner there  the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction  because  of course  it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America  Australia  wherever. But anyway  I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train  and then was faced with the problem  Okay  how do you make this rock into components for a toaster  So I went back to Professor Cilliers  and he said   Go to the library.  So I did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy    completely useless for what I was trying to do. Because  of course  they don't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant. So I ended up going to the History of Science Library and looking at this book. This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West  at least. And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing. But instead of a bellows  I had a leaf blower. And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project  was  the smaller the scale you want to work on  the further back in time you have to go. And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron. I dragged out this stuff  and it wasn't iron. But luckily  I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves  and at    minutes at full power  and I was able to finish off the process. So  my next    The next thing I was trying to get was copper. Again  this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world. It's not anymore  but I found a retired geology professor to take me down  and he said   Okay  I'll let you have some water from the mine.  And the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and will start picking up  dissolving the minerals from the mine. And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto  which is in Portugal. As you can see  it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it. So many such that it's now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic  toxic conditions. But anyway  the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was    there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug. So my next thing  I was off to Scotland to get mica. And mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity. That's me getting mica. And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic  and  of course  my toaster had to have a plastic case. Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods. And so plastic comes from oil  so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil. BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now. But even then they weren't convinced and said   Okay  we'll phone you back     never did. So I looked at other ways of making plastic. And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants  but also from starches. So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic. And for a while that was looking really good. I poured it into the mold  which you can see there  which I've made from a tree trunk. And it was looking good for a while  but I left it outside  because you had to leave it outside to dry  and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato. So kind of out of desperation  I decided that I could think laterally. And geologists have actually christened    well  they're debating whether to christen    the age that we're living in    they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene  the age of Man. And that's because geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now. So suddenly  it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the       or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since     . And there'd also be an extinction event    like fossils would suddenly disappear. And also  I thought that there would be synthetic polymers  plastics  embedded in the rock. So I looked up a plastic    so I decided that I could mine some of this modern day rock. And I went up to Manchester to visit a place called Axion Recycling. And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE  which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive. And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill. But this is it. So there's a picture of my toaster. That's it without the case on. And there it is on the shelves. Thanks. Bruno Giussani  I'm told you did plug it in once. TT  Yeah  I did plug it in. I don't know if you could see  but I was never able to make insulation for the wires. Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree. So the wires were uninsulated. So there was     volts going through these homemade copper wires  homemade plug. And for about five seconds  the toaster toasted  but then  unfortunately  the element kind of melted itself. But I considered it a partial success  to be honest. BG  Thomas Thwaites. TT  Thanks. This room may appear to be holding     people  but there's actually so many more  because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities. I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl. I call them  the mystic  and  the warrior.  I was born into a family of politically active  intellectual atheists. There was this equation in my family that went something like this  if you are intelligent  you therefore are not spiritual. I was the freak of the family. I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses. I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. So  looking for answers  I went to Catholic mass. I tagged along with my neighbors. I read Sartre and Socrates. And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school  Gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. And I said to myself   I wanna get me one of them.  And ever since  I've been walking the mystic path  trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called  the optical delusion of everyday consciousness.  So what did he mean by this  I'll show you. Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. Now  see this strange  underwater  coral reef looking thing  It's actually a person's trachea  and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now  all around us. If we're blind to this simple biology  imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions. They've made me a proud I don't know it all. Now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this  the warrior rolls her eyes. She's concerned about what's happening in this world right now. She's worried. She says   Excuse me  I'm pissed off  and I know a few things  and we better get busy about them right now.  I've spent my life as a warrior  working for women's issues  working on political campaigns  being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazy making  housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body. I've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off  who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic    people like Martin Luther King  Jr.  who wrote   I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This   he wrote   is the interrelated structure of reality.  Then Mother Teresa  another mystic warrior  who said   The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small.  And Nelson Mandela  who lives by the African concept of  ubuntu   which means  I need you in order to be me  and you need me in order to be you.  Now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene. But we all actually have the same capacity that they do  and we need to do their work now. I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing  the Other  by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us. Listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the U.S.  Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder    Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot    Pinheads and Patriots    Arguing With Idiots.  They're supposedly tongue in cheek  but they're actually dangerous. Now here's a title that may sound familiar  but whose author may surprise you   Four and a Half Years of Struggle Against Lies  Stupidity and Cowardice.  Who wrote that  That was Adolf Hitler's first title for  Mein Kampf      My Struggle     the book that launched the Nazi party. The worst eras in human history  whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda  they start like this  with negative other izing. And then they morph into violent extremism. This is why I'm launching a new initiative. And it's to help all of us  myself included  to counteract the tendency to  otherize.  And I realize we're all busy people  so don't worry  you can do this on a lunch break. I'm calling my initiative   Take the Other to Lunch.  If you are a Republican  you can take a Democrat to lunch  or if you're a Democrat  think of it as taking a Republican to lunch. Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite  I suggest you start more local  because there is no shortage of the Other right in your own neighborhood. Maybe that person who worships at the mosque  or the church or the synagogue  down the street. Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict. Or maybe your brother in law who doesn't believe in global warming. Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you  or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears. A couple of weeks ago  I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. Now on paper  she passed my smoking ears test. She's an activist from the Right  and I'm an activist from the Left. And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated  and you can use them too  because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch. So first of all  decide on a goal  to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped. And then  before you get together  agree on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunchmate and I came up with these  don't persuade  defend or interrupt. Be curious  be conversational  be real. And listen. From there  we dove in. And we used these questions  Share some of your life experiences with me. What issues deeply concern you  And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side  My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights  and I'm going to share just one with you. I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere. I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side.  What   she wanted to know.  Like we're a bunch of elitist  morally corrupt terrorist lovers.  Well  she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her side way more often  that we called them brainless  gun toting racists  and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. And since we had established some trust  we believed in each other's sincerity. We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of  otherizing  talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. By the end of our lunch  we acknowledged each other's openness. Neither of us had tried to change the other. But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead  we had taken first steps together  past our knee jerk reactions  to the ubuntu place  which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable seeming problems will be found. Who should you invite to lunch  Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing  that will be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch  Will the heavens open and  We Are the World  play over the restaurant sound system  Probably not. Because ubuntu work is slow  and it's difficult. It's two people dropping the pretense of being know it alls. It's two people  two warriors  dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it   Out beyond ideas of wrong doing and right doing  there is a field. I'll meet you there.  So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys  and it's a serious problem with boys. Their culture isn't working in schools  and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem. First  I want to start by saying  this is a boy  and this is a girl  and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl. If I essentialize gender for you today  then you can dismiss what I have to say. So I'm not going to do that. I'm not interested in doing that. This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl. So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls  and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls. But  in fact  most boys tend to be a certain way  and most girls tend to be a certain way. And the point is that  for boys  the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now. How do we know that  The Hundred Girls Project tells us some really nice statistics. For example  for every     girls that are suspended from school  there are     boys that are suspended from school. For every     girls who are expelled from school  there are     boys who are expelled from school. For every     girls in special education  there are     boys. For every     girls with a learning disability  there are     boys. For every     girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed  we have     boys. And by the way  all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black  if you happen to be poor  if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. And if you are a boy  you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Now there is another side to this. And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school  that salaries are still significantly lower  even when controlled for job types  and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years. That's all true. Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and   . And so we should. In fact  what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook  because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic. They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations  and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years. Even in their older years  what we find is that there's still a problem. When we look at the universities     percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now  which is a significant shift. And in fact  university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to    percent female population in universities. This makes university administrators very nervous  because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys. And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university. If you talk to faculty  they may say   Ugh. Yeah  well  they're playing video games  and they're gambling online all night long  and they're playing World of Warcraft  and that's affecting their academic achievement.  Guess what  Video games are not the cause. Video games are a symptom. They were turned off a long time before they got here. So let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and   . There are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today. The first is zero tolerance. A kindergarten teacher I know  her son donated all of his toys to her  and when he did  she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom. What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun  I mean  really. But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today. Now I'm not advocating for bullies. I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives into school. But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school  I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance. Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys. In a lot of classrooms today you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent. You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games    these topics are banned. Boy comes home from school  and he says   I hate writing.   Why do you hate writing  son  What's wrong with writing    Now I have to write what she tells me to write.   Okay  what is she telling you to write    Poems. I have to write poems. And little moments in my life. I don't want to write that stuff.   All right. Well  what do you want to write  What do you want to write about    I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling up. I want to write about this really interesting world. I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody.   All right. Okay.  You tell a teacher that  and they'll ask you  in all seriousness   Should we send this child to the psychologist   And the answer is no  he's just a boy. He's just a little boy. It's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today. So that's the first reason  zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out. The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures  there are fewer male teachers. Anybody who's over    doesn't know what this means  because in the last    years  the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half. We went from    percent to seven percent. That means that    percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women. Now what's the problem with this  Women are great. Yep  absolutely. But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart    they've got dads  they've got pastors  they've got Cub Scout leaders  but ultimately  six hours a day  five days a week they're spending in a classroom  and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist. And so they say  I guess this really isn't a place for boys. This is a place for girls. And I'm not very good at this  so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports  or something like that  because I obviously don't belong here. Men don't belong here  that's pretty obvious. So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen. But less directly  the lack of male presence in the culture    you've got a teachers' lounge  and they're having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground.  What are we going to do with these boys   The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table. Are there men around that table  Are there moms who've raised boys around that table  You'll see  the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. Third reason that boys are out of sync with school today  kindergarten is the old second grade  folks. We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there. When you're three  you better be able to write your name legibly  or else we'll consider it a developmental delay. By the time you're in first grade  you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture  maybe not  in a book of maybe    to    pages. If you don't  we're probably going to be putting you into a Title   special reading program. And if you ask Title   teachers  they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program  in the elementary grades. The reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is  you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time.  The teacher's salary depends on  No Child Left Behind  and  Race to the Top  and accountability and testing and all of this. So she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum    and girls. This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids. And what happens is  she says   Please  sit down  be quiet  do what you're told  follow the rules  manage your time  focus  be a girl.  That's what she tells them. Indirectly  that's what she tells them. And so this is a very serious problem. Where is it coming from  It's coming from us. We want our babies to read when they are six months old. Have you seen the ads  We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average  but what this does to our children is really not healthy. It's not developmentally appropriate  and it's particularly bad for boys. So what do we do  We need to meet them where they are. We need to put ourselves into boy culture. We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools. More specifically  we can do some very specific things. We can design better games. Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards. They're glorified drill and practice. They don't have the depth  the rich narrative that really engaging video games have  that the boys are really interested in. So we need to design better games. We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians. We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom. We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies. Do they make sense  We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can  trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them. All of those conversations need to be happening. There are some great examples out there of schools    the New York Times just talked about a school recently. A game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school. But it only treats a few kids  and so this isn't very scalable. We have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today. We need to find more money for game design. Because good games  really good games  cost money  and World of Warcraft has quite a budget. Most of the educational games do not. Where we started  my colleagues    Mike Petner  Shawn Vashaw  myself    we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming  what do they say about it. And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school  who talk about gaming  in pretty demeaning ways. They say   Oh  yeah. They're always talking about that stuff. They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges  or whatever it is that they get. And they're always talking about this stuff.  And they say these things as if it's okay. But if it were your culture  think of how that might feel. It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language. They're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies. They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything. So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms. Because  ultimately  if we don't  then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying   Well I guess that was just a place for girls. It wasn't for me. So I've got to do gaming  or I've got to do sports.  If we change these things  if we pay attention to these things  and we re engage boys in their learning  they will leave the elementary schools saying   I'm smart.  Thank you. I just did something I've never done before. I spent a week at sea on a research vessel. Now I'm not a scientist  but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the boat we were on  by the way. The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff    the birds  the turtles  the dolphins  the glamorous stuff. They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff. And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton  which is very bad news  because so much life depends on it. So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how    percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it  this disaster is still unfolding. It's still working its way up the food chain. Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us. Rachel Carson    the godmother of modern environmentalism    warned us about this very thing back in     . She pointed out that the  control men     as she called them    who carpet bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT  were only trying to kill the little stuff  the insects  not the birds. But they forgot this  the fact that birds dine on grubs  that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT. And so  robin eggs failed to hatch  songbirds died en masse  towns fell silent. Thus the title  Silent Spring.  I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico  because I'm Canadian  and I can draw no ancestral ties. And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster  with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world  with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV     hours a day  for months. After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature  suddenly we were face to face with our weakness  with our lack of control  as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it     top hats    top kills  and  most memorably  the  junk shot     the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world. But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed    the carelessness  the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean up. If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear  it is that  as a culture  we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable  and to do so without a back up plan  without an exit strategy. And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years. Our leaders barrel into wars  telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades. Then  it is years of deadly damage control  Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter insurgencies  and once again  no exit strategy. Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence  convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market    the kind that never goes down. And when it inevitably does  the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot    in this case  throwing massive amounts of much needed public money down a very different kind of hole. As with BP  the hole does get plugged  at least temporarily  but not before exacting a tremendous price. We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen  because we are in the midst of what may be our highest stakes gamble of all    deciding what to do  or not to do  about climate change. Now as you know  a great deal of time is spent  in this country and around the world  inside the climate debate  on the question of   What if the IPC scientists are all wrong   Now a far more relevant question    as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it    is   What if those scientists are right   Given the stakes  the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle    the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible  we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty. Better to err on the side of caution. More overt  the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed  but rather on the industry that stands to profit. But climate policy in the wealthy world    to the extent that such a thing exists    is not based on precaution  but rather on cost benefit analysis    finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP. So rather than asking  as precaution would demand  what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe  we ask bizarre questions like this   What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions  Can we put this off till                    Or we ask   How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive  Can we go with two degrees  three degrees  or    where we're currently going    four degrees Celsius   And by the way  the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat  making the planet not too hot  not too cold  but just right    sort of Goldilocks style    this is pure fantasy  and it's not coming from the climate scientists. It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science. The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops. So once again  why do we take these crazy risks with the precious  A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now  like  greed.  This is a popular explanation  and there's lots of truth to it  because taking big risks  as we all know  pays a lot of money. Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris. And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness. For instance  if you happen to be a    year old banker taking home     times more than a brain surgeon  then you need a narrative  you need a story that makes that disparity okay. And you actually don't have a lot of options. You're either an incredibly good scammer  and you're getting away with it    you gamed the system    or you're some kind of boy genius  the likes of which the world has never seen. Now both of these options    the boy genius and the scammer    are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future. By the way  Tony Hayward  the former CEO of BP  had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan   What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail   Now this is actually a popular plaque  and this is a crowd of overachievers  so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque. Don't feel ashamed. Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk  but personally  I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall  because    maybe not that one in particular    but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time. So we have greed  we've got overconfidence hubris  but since we're here at TEDWomen  let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness. Now I'm not going to belabor this point  but studies do show that  as investors  women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men  precisely because  as we've already heard  women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do. So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides    for society at least. The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted  chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides. And this problem    call it the  perils of privilege     brings us closer  I think  to the root of our collective recklessness. Because none of us    at least in the global North    neither men nor women  are fully exempt from this message. Here's what I'm talking about. Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them  our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature    the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer  the narrative of manifest destiny  the narrative of apocalypse and salvation. And just when you think these stories are fading into history  and that we've gotten over them  they pop up in the strangest places. For instance  I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport. It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone  and yes  it really does say   Slap Mother Nature in the face.  And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola    that's just a bonus. I'm showing it because    they're not a sponsor  are they     because  in its own way  this is a crass version of our founding story. We slapped Mother Nature around and won  and we always win  because dominating nature is our destiny. But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature. There's another one  equally important  about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance. Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.  The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean. The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume.  In other words  the ocean is big  she can take it. It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do. Because this is our real master narrative  however much we mess up  there will always be more    more water  more land  more untapped resources. A new bubble will replace the old one. A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one. In a way  that is the story of the settling of the Americas  the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped. And it's also the story of modern capitalism  because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system  one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers. Now the problem is that the story was always a lie. The Earth always did have limits. They were just beyond our sights. And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts. I believe that we know this  yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop. Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories  but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that  frankly  verges on camp. How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin  Now on the one hand  exhorting us to  drill  baby  drill   because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them  and on the other  glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show. The twin message is as comforting as it is mad. Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall. There are still no limits. There will always be another frontier. So stop worrying and keep shopping. Now  would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show. In environmental circles  we often hear that  rather than shifting to renewables  we are continuing with business as usual. This assessment  unfortunately  is far too optimistic. The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era  the era of extreme energy. So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water  including the icy Arctic seas  where a clean up may simply be impossible. It means large scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip mining operations for coal  the likes of which we haven't yet seen. And most controversially  it means the tar sands. I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands  which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States. It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice  because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else. So this is where the tar sands live  under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests. The oil is not liquid. You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. Tar sand's oil is solid  mixed in with the soil. So to get at it  you first have to get rid of the trees. Then  you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand. The process requires a huge amount of water  which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds. That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates. Now looking at these images  it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation  which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England. I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth  the largest ever built. That's a person down there by the wheel. My point is that this is not oil drilling. It's not even mining. It is terrestrial skinning. Vast  vivid landscapes are being gutted  left monochromatic gray. Now I should confess that as  far as  I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon. But the truth is that  on average  turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada. How else to describe this  but as a form of mass insanity  Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet  off the power of sun  wind and waves  we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest  highest emitting stuff imaginable. This is where our story of endless growth has taken us  to this black hole at the center of my country    a place of such planetary pain that  like the BP gusher  one can only stand to look at it for so long. As Jared Diamond and others have shown us  this is how civilizations commit suicide  by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes. The problem is that our master narrative has an answer for that too. At the very last minute  we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie  just like in the Rapture. But  of course  our secular religion is technology. Now  you may have noticed more and more headlines like these. The idea behind this form of  geoengineering  as it's called  is that  as the planet heats up  we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space  thereby cooling the planet. The wackiest plan    and I'm not making this up    would put what is essentially a garden hose    and a half miles high into the sky  suspended by balloons  to spew sulfur dioxide. So  solving the problem of pollution with more pollution. Think of it as the ultimate junk shot. The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested. They don't know if they'll work  and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash. Nevertheless  the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles  particularly media circles  with a relief tinged with euphoria. An escape hatch has been reached. A new frontier has been found. Most importantly  we don't have to change our lifestyles after all. You see  for some people  their savior is a guy in a flowing robe. For other people  it's a guy with a garden hose. We badly need some new stories. We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks    risks that confront recklessness head on  that put the precautionary principle into practice  even if that means through direct action    like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested  blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop removal coal mining. We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around. That this is our only home. There is no escape hatch. Call it karma  call it physics  action and reaction  call it precaution    the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit. Thank you. You may not know this  but you are celebrating an anniversary with me. I'm not married  but one year ago today  I woke up from a month long coma  following a double lung transplant. Crazy  I know. Insane. Thank you. Six years before that  I was starting my career as an opera singer in Europe  when I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension    also known as PH. It happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins  making the right side of the heart work overtime  and causing what I call the reverse Grinch effect. My heart was three and a half sizes too big. Physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition  and usually after two to five years  you die. I went to see this specialist  and she was top of the field and told me I had to stop singing. She said   Those high notes are going to kill you.  While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension  she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary. I was very limited by my condition  physically. But I was not limited when I sang  and as air came up from my lungs  through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound  it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence. And just because of someone's hunch  I wasn't going to give it up. Thankfully  I met Reda Girgis  who is dry as toast  but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive  they wanted me to live a meaningful life. This meant making trade offs. I come from Colorado. It's a mile high  and I grew up there with my    brothers and sisters and two adoring parents. Well  the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby. I couldn't walk as much as I used to  so I opted for five inch heels. And I gave up salt  I went vegan  and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil  also known as Viagra. My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH  but after six months  I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs. I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to faint. I had a heart catheterization  where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure  which is supposed to be between    and   . Mine was    . I like to do things big  and it meant one thing  there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan  and it's not just a drug  it's a way of life. Doctors insert a catheter into your chest  which is attached to a pump that weighs about four and a half pounds. Every day     hours  that pump is at your side  administering medicine directly to your heart  and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses. This is a list of the side effects  if you eat too much salt  like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  you'll probably end up in the ICU. If you go through a metal detector  you'll probably die. If you get a bubble in your medicine    because you have to mix it every morning    and it stays in there  you probably die. If you run out of medicine  you definitely die. No one wants to go on Flolan. But when I needed it  it was a godsend. Within a few days  I could walk again. Within a few weeks  I was performing  and in a few months  I debuted at the Kennedy Center. The pump was a little bit problematic when performing  so I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage. Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx  hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly. And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers. I graduated from graduate school in       and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe. A few days after arriving  I met this wonderful  old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles. And before long  I was commuting between Budapest  Milan and Florence. Though I was attached to this ugly  unwanted  high maintenance  mechanical pet  my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera    very complicated  but in a good way. Then in February of       my grandfather passed away. He was a big figure in all of our lives  and we loved him very much. It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next. Seven weeks later  I got a call from my family. My father had been in a catastrophic car accident  and he died. At     my death would have been entirely expected. But his    well  the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline. Against my doctors' and family's wishes  I needed to go back for the funeral. I had to say goodbye in some way  shape or form. But soon I was showing signs of right heart failure  and I had to return to sea level  doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again. I canceled most of my engagements that summer  but I had one left in Tel Aviv  so I went. After one performance  I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab. I sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face  and in the heat of the desert  I was freezing cold. My fingers started turning blue  and I was like   What is going on here   I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed. The cab stopped  and I pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as I walked to the elevator. I fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where I found my problem  I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine. I was dying  and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast  I would never leave that apartment alive. I started mixing  and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another  but I just kept on going. Finally  with the last bottle in and the last bubble out  I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough. If it didn't  I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated. Thankfully  in a few minutes  I saw the signature hive like rash appear on my legs  which is a side effect of the medication  and I knew I'd be okay. We're not big on fear in my family  but I was scared. I went back to the States  anticipating I'd return to Europe  but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight for life from Johns Hopkins Hospital. I performed here and there  but as my condition deteriorated  so did my voice. My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant. I didn't. I had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries. I knew another young man  though  who had PH who died while waiting for one. I wanted to live. I thought stem cells were a good option  but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet. I officially took a break from singing  and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years  for transplant. I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon  and I asked him if I needed a transplant  what I could do to prepare. He said   Be happy. A happy patient is a healthy patient.  It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius. I still didn't want a transplant  but in a month  I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles    very attractive. And it was right heart failure. I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice. It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match. But the next morning  while I was still in the hospital  I got a telephone call. It was my doctor in Cleveland  Marie Budev. And they had lungs. It was a match. They were from Texas. And everybody was really happy for me  but me. Because  despite their problems  I had spent my whole life training my lungs  and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up. I flew to Cleveland  and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye. But organs don't wait  and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket  telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again  and to please try and save my voice. I fell into this apocalyptic dream world. During the thirteen and a half hour surgery  I flatlined twice     quarts of blood were infused into my body. And in my surgeon's    year career  he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed. They left my chest open for two weeks. You could see my over sized heart beating inside of it. I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive. An infection ravaged my skin. I had hoped my voice would be saved  but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it. If they stayed in  there was no way I would ever sing again. So my doctor got the ENT  the top guy at the clinic  to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box. He said it would kill me. So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt to save my voice. Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery  she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed. And if you want an example of perseverance  grit and strength in a beautiful  little package  it is her. One year ago to this very day  I woke up. I was    lbs. There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body. I couldn't walk  I couldn't talk  I couldn't eat  I couldn't move  I certainly couldn't sing  I couldn't even breathe  but when I looked up and I saw my mother  I couldn't help but smile. Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs  death happens. But life isn't really just about avoiding death  is it  It's about living. Medical conditions don't negate the human condition. And when people are allowed to pursue their passions  doctors will find they have better  happier and healthier patients. My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place  but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time. And I'm so grateful they did. This past summer  when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies  I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing. And I wanted to tell her  and I want to tell you  we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams. When we do  we will find that patients don't just survive  we thrive. And some of us might even sing.  Singing  French  Thank you. Thank you. And I'd like to thank my pianist  Monica Lee. Thank you so much. Thank you. I am honored to be here  and I'm honored to talk about this topic  which I think is of grave importance. We've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species  but plastic hurts people too  especially poor people. And both in the production of plastic  the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic  the people who have the bull's eye on their foreheads are poor people. People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened for very good reason. People thought about   Oh  my God. This is terrible  this oil    it's in the water. It's going to destroy the living systems there. People are going to be hurt. This is a terrible thing  that the oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf.  What people don't think about is  what if the oil had made it safely to shore  What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go  Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming  but there's a place called  Cancer Alley   and the reason it's called  Cancer Alley  is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and  in the process  kills people. It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf. So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there's a spill  they're a problem where there's not. And what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products. The other thing that we don't often appreciate is it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer. Poor people also suffer at the point of use. Those of us who earn a certain income level  we have something called choice. The reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices  economic choices. We actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous  poisonous plastic in them. Other people who are poor don't have those choices. So low income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using. Those are the people who wind up actually ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic and using it. And people say   Well  they should just buy a different product.  Well  the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices. You often have to buy the cheapest products. The cheapest products are often the most dangerous. And if that weren't bad enough  if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer in places like  Cancer Alley  and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use  at the point of disposal  once again  it's poor people who bear the burden. Often  we think we're doing a good thing. You're in your office  and you're drinking your bottled water  or whatever it is  and you think to yourself   Hey  I'm going to throw this away. No  I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin.  You think   I put mine in the blue bin   and then you look at your colleague and say   Why  you cretin. You put yours in the white bin.  And we use that as a moral tickle. We feel so good about ourselves. Maybe I'll feel good myself. Not you  but I feel this way. And so we kind of have this kind of moral feel good moment. But if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its journey  we would be shocked to discover that  all too often  that bottle is going to be put on a boat  it's going to go all the way across the ocean at some expense  and it's going to wind up in a developing country    often China. I think in our minds we imagine somebody's going to take the little bottle  say   Oh  little bottle. We're so happy to see you  little bottle.   You've served so well.  He's given a little bottle massage  a little bottle medal. And say   What would you like to do next   The little bottle says   I just don't know.  But that's not actually what happens. That bottle winds up getting burned. Recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic  the burning of the plastic  which releases incredible toxic chemicals and  once again  kills people. And so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like  Cancer Alley   poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately  and then poor people  who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened  are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability. Now you think to yourself    because I know how you are    you say   That sure is terrible for those poor people. It's just awful  those poor people. I hope someone does something to help them.  But what we don't understand is    is  here we are in Los Angeles. We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. But guess what  Because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now  because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now  almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia. So  we all are being hit. We all are being impacted. It's just the poor people get hit first and worst. But the dirty production  the burning of toxins  the lack of environmental standards in Asia is actually creating so much dirty air pollution it's coming across the ocean and has erased our gains here in California. We're back where we were in the     s. And so we're on one planet  and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems. Well the root of this problem  in my view  is the idea of disposability itself. You see  if you understand the link between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people  you arrive at a very troubling  but also very helpful  insight  In order to trash the planet  you have to trash people. But if you create a world where you don't trash people  you can't trash the planet. So now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea  we finally can now see that they are really  at the end of the day  one idea. And it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything. We don't have disposable resources. We don't have disposable species. And we don't have disposable people either. We don't have a throwaway planet  and we don't have throwaway children    it's all precious. And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding  new opportunities for action begin to emerge. Biomimicry  which is something that is an emerging science  winds up being a very important social justice idea. People who are just learning about this stuff  biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. Democracy  by the way  means respecting the wisdom of all people    and we'll get to that. But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. It turns out we're a pretty clever species. This big cortex  or whatever  we're pretty proud of ourselves. But if we want to make something hard  we come up   I know  I'm going to make a hard substance. I know  I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute  but I got this hard thing. I'm so clever   and you look behind you  and there's destruction all around you. But guess what  You're so clever  but you're not as clever as a clam. A clamshell's hard. There's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces. There's no poison. There's no pollution. It turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well. Well that insight of biomimicry  of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species. I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff. I don't mean looking at it from that way    abusing the little species. I mean actually respecting them  respecting what they've achieved. That's called biomimicry  and that opens the door to zero waste production  zero pollution production    that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life  a high standard of living without trashing the planet. Well that idea of biomimicry  respecting the wisdom of all species  combined with the idea of democracy and social justice  respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people  would give us a different society. We would have a different economy. We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of. That should be the goal. And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we've talked about  but it even corrupts our own society. We're so proud to live here in California. We just had this vote  and everybody's like   Well  not in our state. I don't know what those other states were doing.  Just so proud. And  yeah  I'm proud  too. But California  though we lead the world in some of the green stuff  we also  unfortunately  lead the world in some of the gulag stuff. California has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the    states. We have a moral challenge in this moment. We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill  but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings  living people. And I would say that we live in a country    five percent of the world's population     percent of the greenhouse gases  but also    percent of the world's prisoners. One out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the United States. So that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in. And yet  as a movement that has to broaden its constituency  that has to grow  that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone  one of the challenges to the success of this movement  of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift  is people look at our movement with some suspicion. And they ask a question  and the question is  How can these people be so passionate  A poor person  a low income person  somebody in  Cancer Alley   somebody in Watts  somebody in Harlem  somebody on an Indian reservation  might say to themselves  and rightfully so   How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life  or an aluminum can has a second chance  and yet  when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison  he doesn't get a second chance   How can this movement be so passionate about saying we don't have throwaway stuff  no throwaway dead materials  and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like  Cancer Alley   And so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement. When we take on topics like this  it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow  and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in. Most of you are good  softhearted people. When you were younger  you cared about the whole world  and at some point somebody said you had to pick an issue  you had to boil your love down to an issue. Can't love the whole world    you've got to work on trees  or you've got to work on immigration. You've got to shrink it down and be about one issue. And really  they fundamentally told you   Are you going to hug a tree  or are you going to hug a child  Pick. Are you going to hug a tree  or are you going to hug a child  Pick.  Well  when you start working on issues like plastic  you realize that the whole thing is connected  and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms. We can hug both. Thank you very much. I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge  the challenge of dealing with data  data that we have to deal with in medical situations. It's really a huge challenge for us. And this is our beast of burden    this is a Computer Tomography machine  a CT machine. It's a fantastic device. It uses X rays  X ray beams  that are rotating very fast around the human body. It takes about    seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine. So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care  but as I said  it's also a challenge for us. And the challenge is really found in this picture here. It's the medical data explosion that we're having right now. We're facing this problem. And let me step back in time. Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. These machines that came out    they started coming in the     s    they would scan human bodies  and they would generate about     images of the human body. And I've taken the liberty  just for clarity  to translate that to data slices. That would correspond to about    megabytes of data  which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices. If you translate that to phone books  it's about one meter of phone books in the pile. Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have  we can  just in a few seconds  get        images out of a body  and that would correspond to about    gigabytes of data  or     phone books  and the pile would then be     meters of phone books. What's about to happen    and we're seeing this  it's beginning    a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time resolved situations as well. So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well. And just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds  and that would correspond to one terabyte of data    that's         books and    kilometers of phone books. That's one patient  one data set. And this is what we have to deal with. So this is really the enormous challenge that we have. And already today    this is        images. Imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this. They would put up        images  they would go like this            okay  okay. There is the problem.  They can't do that anymore. That's impossible. So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this. So what we do is that we put all these slices together. Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions  and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data  into a block of data. So this is really what we're doing. So this gigabyte or terabyte of data  we're putting it into this block. But of course  the block of data just contains the amount of X ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body. So what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at. So transforming the data set into something that looks like this. And this is a challenge. This is a huge challenge for us to do that. Using computers  even though they're getting faster and better all the time  it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data  terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information. I want to look at the heart. I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver. Maybe even find a tumor  in some cases. So this is where this little dear comes into play. This is my daughter. This is as of   a.m. this morning. She's playing a computer game. She's only two years old  and she's having a blast. So she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics processing units. As long as kids are playing computer games  graphics is getting better and better and better. So please go back home  tell your kids to play more games  because that's what I need. So what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing with the medical data. So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices. And you know  going back maybe    years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer    it was a huge machine. It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything. I paid about one million dollars for that machine. That machine is  today  about as fast as my iPhone. So every month there are new graphics cards coming out  and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors    NVIDIA  ATI  Intel is out there as well. And you know  for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer  and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards. So this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine  together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms    compressing data  extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on. So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do. This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner. You can see that this is a full data  set . It's a woman. You can see the hair. You can see the individual structures of the woman. You can see that there is  a  scattering of X rays on the teeth  the metal in the teeth. That's where those artifacts are coming from. But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer  I can just put in a clip plane. And of course all the data is inside  so I can start rotating  I can look at it from different angles  and I can see that this woman had a problem. She had a bleeding up in the brain  and that's been fixed with a little stent  a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel. And just by changing the functions  then I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible. I can look at the skull structure  and I can see that  okay  this is where they opened up the skull on this woman  and that's where they went in. So these are fantastic images. They're really high resolution  and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today. Now we have really made use of this  and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system. And one of the applications that we've been working on    and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide    is the application of virtual autopsies. So again  looking at very  very large data sets  and you saw those full body scans that we can do. We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner  and just in a few seconds we can get a full body data set. So this is from a virtual autopsy. And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off. First you saw the body bag that the body came in  then I'm peeling off the skin    you can see the muscles    and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman. Now at this point  I would also like to emphasize that  with the greatest respect for the people that I'm now going to show    I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies    so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that I'm showing these pictures to you. In the forensic case    and this is something that ... there's been approximately     cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years. So this will be the typical workflow situation. The police will decide    in the evening  when there's a case coming in    they will decide  okay  is this a case where we need to do an autopsy  So in the morning  in between six and seven in the morning  the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners. And then the radiologist  together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist  looks at the data that's coming out  and they have a joint session. And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that. Now looking at a few cases  here's one of the first cases that we had. You can really see the details of the data set. It's very high resolution  and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details. And again  it's fully interactive  so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here. Without saying too much about this case  this is a traffic accident  a drunk driver hit a woman. And it's very  very easy to see the damages on the bone structure. And the cause of death is the broken neck. And this women also ended up under the car  so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury. Here's another case  a knifing. And this is also again showing us what we can do. It's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body. You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth    that's actually the filling of the teeth    but because I've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent. Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person. The person was killed by stabs in the heart  but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. Here's another case. It's very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings. Here you can see that knife went through the heart. It's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part  which is difficult to do in a normal  standard  physical autopsy. So it really  really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death  and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was. Here's another case that I think is interesting. Here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person. And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source  so that bullet is actually shining  and it makes it really easy to find these fragments. During a physical autopsy  if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments  that's actually quite hard to do. One of the things that I'm really  really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table. It's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms  using standard graphics GPUs. It actually looks like this  just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. It really just works like a huge iPhone. So we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table  and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface. So if you were thinking of buying an iPad  forget about it. This is what you want instead. Steve  I hope you're listening to this  all right. So it's a very nice little device. So if you have the opportunity  please try it out. It's really a hands on experience. So it gained some traction  and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes  but also  perhaps in the future  in a more clinical situation. There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this  if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies. Okay  now that we're talking about touch  let me move on to really  touching  data. And this is a bit of science fiction now  so we're moving into really the future. This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now  but I hope they will in the future. So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device. It's a little mechanical pen that has very  very fast step motors inside of the pen. And so I can generate a force feedback. So when I virtually touch data  it will generate forces in the pen  so I get a feedback. So in this particular situation  it's a scan of a living person. I have this pen  and I look at the data  and I move the pen towards the head  and all of a sudden I feel resistance. So I can feel the skin. If I push a little bit harder  I'll go through the skin  and I can feel the bone structure inside. If I push even harder  I'll go through the bone structure  especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft. And then I can feel the brain inside  and this will be the slushy like this. So this is really nice. And to take that even further  this is a heart. And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners  that just in  .  seconds  I can scan the whole heart  and I can do that with time resolution. So just looking at this heart  I can play back a video here. And this is Karljohan  one of my graduate students who's been working on this project. And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device  the force feedback system  and he's moving his pen towards the heart  and the heart is now beating in front of him  so he can see how the heart is beating. He's taken the pen  and he's moving it towards the heart  and he's putting it on the heart  and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient. Then he can examine how the heart is moving. He can go inside  push inside of the heart  and really feel how the valves are moving. And this  I think  is really the future for heart surgeons. I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery  and do that with high quality resolution data. So this is really neat. Now we're going even further into science fiction. And we heard a little bit about functional MRI. Now this is really an interesting project. MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain  or any part of the body. So what we're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain  but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen. That means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain. So this is something that we've been working on. And you just saw Motts the research engineer  there  going into the MRI system  and he was wearing goggles. So he could actually see things in the goggles. So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner. And this is a little bit freaky  because what Motts is seeing is actually this. He's seeing his own brain. So Motts is doing something here  and probably he is going like this with his right hand  because the left side is activated on the motor cortex. And then he can see that at the same time. These visualizations are brand new. And this is something that we've been researching for a little while. This is another sequence of Motts' brain. And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from    . So he's going             .  And then he's going backwards. And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain. Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time. We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things. You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head  because that's where he's seeing  he's seeing his own brain. And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things. The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well  and it's shining through  because all of the data is inside this volume. And in just a second here you will see    okay  here. Motts  now move your left foot. So he's going like this. For    seconds he's going like that  and all of a sudden it lights up up here. So we've got motor cortex activation up there. So this is really  really nice  and I think this is a great tool. And connecting also with the previous talk here  this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working  how the brain is working  and we can do this with very  very high visual quality and very fast resolution. Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center. So this is a CAT scan    Computer Aided Tomography. So this is a lion from the local zoo outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden  Elsa. So she came to the center  and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner. And then  of course  I get the whole data set from the lion. And I can do very nice images like this. I can peel off the layer of the lion. I can look inside of it. And we've been experimenting with this. And I think this is a great application for the future of this technology  because there's very little known about the animal anatomy. What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information. We can scan all sorts of things  all sorts of animals. The only problem is to fit it into the machine. So here's a bear. It was kind of hard to get it in. And the bear is a cuddly  friendly animal. And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear. And you might want to cuddle this one  until you change the functions and look at this. So be aware of the bear. So with that  I'd like to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images. It's a huge effort that goes into doing this  gathering the data and developing the algorithms  writing all the software. So  some very talented people. My motto is always  I only hire people that are smarter than I am and most of these are smarter than I am. So thank you very much. Some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields. So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment  which is entertainment and robotics. So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society  maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology. Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology. With my new venture  Marilyn Monrobot  I would like to use art to create tech. So we're based in New York City. And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot  or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation  please contact me  the Bot Agent. The bot  our rising celebrity  also has his own Twitter account   robotinthewild. I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots  Data. He's named after the Star Trek character. I think he's going to be super popular. We've got the robot    in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes. So it knows something about the subject  it knows about the length. It knows how much it's moving. And so it's going to try to watch your response. I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today. It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things  sort of like Netflix style  over longer term to different communities or audiences  children versus adults  different cultures. You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions. Some of you in this middle section    you have red green paddles. If you like what's going on  show the green. If you don't like the subject or the performance  you can hold the red. Now don't be shy. It's just a robot. It doesn't have feelings ... yet. And the rest of you  you still count  you still matter. There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing    I hope not    to help make some of its next decisions. Right  so  let the robot stand up comedy begin. Data  Hello TEDWomen. It's an honor to be here. You guys are looking good out there. Ready for some jokes  Audience  Yeah. Data  Here's the first one. Right  so  a doctor says to his patient   I have bad news and worse news. The bad news is that you only have    hours to live.   That's terrible   said the patient.  How can the news possibly be worse    I've been trying to contact you since yesterday.  The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. Heather Knight  He's talking about the Swiss. Data  Pretty lucky for them. Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with   Come on buddy  I have the toe clippers right here. You get past me  the guy behind me has a spoon.  HK  He's a French robot. Data  A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods. One of them falls to the ground. He does not seem to be breathing. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls    . He gasps to the operator   My friend is dead. What can I do   The operator says   Just take it easy. I can help. First  let's make sure he's dead.  There is a silence  and the operator hears a shot. The guy's voice comes back on the line   Okay  now what   Question  Why is television called a medium  Anyone  Because it's neither rare nor well done. But to be completely honest with you  I kind of love television. Any of you like television  Audience  Yes. Data  I find it incredibly educational. Actually  as soon as someone turns it on  I go into the other room and read. That's all for now. Was that okay for my first time  You've been a great audience. Thank you. HK  Yay. So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance. So thank you all for being a part of it. There's a lot more to come. And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression. Thank you very much. The world is changing with really remarkable speed. If you look at the chart at the top here  you'll see that in       these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And if you look at the chart for       it's projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy  and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis. A couple of weeks ago  I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. Goldman Sachs projected     . The post crisis projection is     . That's just a decade away. China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. First of all  it's a huge developing country with a population of  .  billion people  which has been growing for over    years at around    percent a year. And within a decade  it will have the largest economy in the world. Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country  rather than a developed country. Secondly  for the first time in the modern era  the dominant country in the world    which I think is what China will become    will be not from the West and from very  very different civilizational roots. Now  I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize  they also westernize. This is an illusion. It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition  markets and technology. It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture. China is not like the West  and it will not become like the West. It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. Now the big question here is obviously  how do we make sense of China  How do we try to understand what China is  And the problem we have in the West at the moment  by and large  is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms  using Western ideas. We can't. Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like  just as a beginning. The first is this  that China is not really a nation state. Okay  it's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years  but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this. This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in     B.C. at the end of the warring state period    the birth of modern China. And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. Or immediately afterward  the Han Dynasty  still       years ago. And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China  which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now. Now what is extraordinary about this is  what gives China its sense of being China  what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese  comes not from the last hundred years  not from the nation state period  which is what happened in the West  but from the period  if you like  of the civilization state. I'm thinking here  for example  of customs like ancestral worship  of a very distinctive notion of the state  likewise  a very distinctive notion of the family  social relationships like guanxi  Confucian values and so on. These are all things that come from the period of the civilization state. In other words  China  unlike the Western states and most countries in the world  is shaped by its sense of civilization  its existence as a civilization state  rather than as a nation state. And there's one other thing to add to this  and that is this  Of course we know China's big  huge  demographically and geographically  with a population of  .  billion people. What we often aren't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic  and in many ways very decentralized. You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing  even though we think this to be the case. It's never been the case. So this is China  a civilization state  rather than a nation state. And what does it mean  Well  I think it has all sorts of profound implications. I'll give you two quick ones. The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity  is the maintenance of Chinese civilization. You know        years ago  Europe  breakdown    the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire. It divided  and it's remained divided ever since. China  over the same time period  went in exactly the opposite direction  very painfully holding this huge civilization  civilization state  together. The second is maybe more prosaic  which is Hong Kong. Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in       You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was. One country  two systems. And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them.  Window dressing. When China gets its hands on Hong Kong  that won't be the case.  Thirteen years on  the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in     . We were wrong. Why were we wrong  We were wrong because we thought  naturally enough  in nation state ways. Think of German unification      . What happened  Well  basically the East was swallowed by the West. One nation  one system. That is the nation state mentality. But you can't run a country like China  a civilization state  on the basis of one civilization  one system. It doesn't work. So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong    as it will be to the question of Taiwan    was a natural response  one civilization  many systems. Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China    maybe not sort of a comfortable one. The Chinese have a very  very different conception of race to most other countries. Do you know  of the  .  billion Chinese  over    percent of them think they belong to the same race  the Han  Now  this is completely different from the world's  other  most populous countries. India  the United States  Indonesia  Brazil    all of them are multiracial. The Chinese don't feel like that. China is only multiracial really at the margins. So the question is  why  Well the reason  I think  essentially is  again  back to the civilization state. A history of at least       years  a history of conquest  occupation  absorption  assimilation and so on  led to the process by which  over time  this notion of the Han emerged    of course  nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity. Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that  without the Han  China could never have held together. The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together. The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference. They really believe in their own superiority  and they are disrespectful of those who are not. Hence their attitude  for example  to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans. Or let me give you my third building block  the Chinese state. Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West. Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think    in these days at least    that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state. And the reason for this is because    well  there are two reasons  I think. And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy  because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy. And the reason for this is  firstly  because the state in China is given a very special    it enjoys a very special significance as the representative  the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization  of the civilization state. This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role. And the second reason is because  whereas in Europe and North America  the state's power is continuously challenged    I mean in the European tradition  historically against the church  against other sectors of the aristocracy  against merchants and so on    for       years  the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged. It's had no serious rivals. So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history. The result  by the way  is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder  a stranger  certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained  the Chinese don't see the state like that at all. The Chinese view the state as an intimate    not just as an intimate actually  as a member of the family    not just in fact as a member of the family  but as the head of the family  the patriarch of the family. This is the Chinese view of the state    very  very different to ours. It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West. And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here  in the Chinese context  is a new kind of paradigm  which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past. Know that China believes in the market and the state. I mean  Adam Smith  already writing in the late   th century  said   The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe.  And  apart from the Mao period  that has remained more or less the case ever since. But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. The state is everywhere in China. I mean  it's leading firms    many of them are still publicly owned. Private firms  however large they are  like Lenovo  depend in many ways on state patronage. Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state. And the state  of course  its authority flows into lots of other areas    as we are familiar with    with something like the one child policy. Moreover  this is a very old state tradition  a very old tradition of statecraft. I mean  if you want an illustration of this  the Great Wall is one. But this is another  this is the Grand Canal  which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C. and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D. It went for       miles  linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai. So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China  which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today  which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China. So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China    the civilization state  the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society. And yet we still insist  by and large  in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience  looking at it through Western eyes  using Western concepts. If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong    our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect    this is the reason. Unfortunately  I think  I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. It's kind of arrogant. It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best  and therefore we have the universal measure. And secondly  it's ignorant. We refuse to really address the issue of difference. You know  there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen  the American historian. And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures. But it's not. In many ways  it's the most parochial  because for     years  the West has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures  other civilizations. Because  at the end of the day  it could  if necessary by force  get its own way. Whereas those cultures    virtually the rest of the world  in fact  which have been in a far weaker position  vis a vis the West    have been thereby forced to understand the West  because of the West's presence in those societies. And therefore  they are  as a result  more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West. I mean  take the question of East Asia. East Asia  Japan  Korea  China  etc.    a third of the world's population lives there. Now the largest economic region in the world. And I'll tell you now  that East Asianers  people from East Asia  are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia. Now this point is very germane  I'm afraid  to the present. Because what's happening  Back to that chart at the beginning  the Goldman Sachs chart. What is happening is that  very rapidly in historical terms  the world is being driven and shaped  not by the old developed countries  but by the developing world. We've seen this in terms of the G   usurping very rapidly the position of the G   or the G . And there are two consequences of this. First  the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago    Copenhagen  climate change conference. Europe was not at the final negotiating table. When did that last happen  I would wager it was probably about     years ago. And that is what is going to happen in the future. And the second implication is that the world will inevitably  as a consequence  become increasingly unfamiliar to us  because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with  or conversant with. And at last  I'm afraid    take Europe  America is slightly different    but Europeans by and large  I have to say  are ignorant  are unaware about the way the world is changing. Some people    I've got an English friend in China  and he said   The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.  Well  maybe that's true  maybe that's an exaggeration. But there's another problem which goes along with this    that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world    and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future. I mean  Europe once  of course  once commanded the future in its confidence. Take the   th century  for example. But this  alas  is no longer true. If you want to feel the future  if you want to taste the future  try China    there's old Confucius. This is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before. It doesn't even look like a railway station. This is the new  Wuhan  railway station for the high speed trains. China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. Or take this  now this is an idea  but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing. Here you have a megabus  on the upper deck carries about       people. It travels on rails down a suburban road  and the cars travel underneath it. And it does speeds of up to about     miles an hour. Now this is the way things are going to move  because China has a very specific problem  which is different from Europe and different from the United States  China has huge numbers of people and no space. So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many  many  many cities over    million people. Okay  so how would I like to finish  Well  what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us  I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it. But I want to argue  above all  a big picture positive for this world. For     years  the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. That's what Europe and North America represented. The arrival of countries like China and India    between them    percent of the world's population    and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on  represent the most important single act of democratization in the last     years. Civilizations and cultures  which had been ignored  which had no voice  which were not listened to  which were not known about  will have a different sort of representation in this world. As humanists  we must welcome  surely  this transformation  and we will have to learn about these civilizations. This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early   th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea  the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. The little boat in front of it was the one in which     years later  Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic. Or  look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in     . I think they're playing golf. Christ  the Chinese even invented golf. Welcome to the future. Thank you. I'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care  which is the patient  or  as I like to use the scientific term  people. Because we are all patients  we are all people. Even doctors are patients at some point. So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and  in fact  worldwide. If you want to get at the big part    I mean from a public health level  where my training is    you're looking at behavioral issues. You're looking at things where people are actually given information  and they're not following through with it. It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes  obesity  many forms of heart disease  even some forms of cancer    when you think of smoking. Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. They know what they're supposed to be doing  but they're not doing it. Now behavior change is something that is a long standing problem in medicine. It goes all the way back to Aristotle. And doctors hate it  right  I mean  they complain about it all the time. We talk about it in terms of engagement  or non compliance. When people don't take their pills  when people don't follow doctors' orders    these are behavior problems. But for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change  there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem. So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision making    giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them  but actually leads them to make better decisions  better choices in their lives. One part of medicine  though  has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well  and that's dentistry. Dentistry might seem    and I think it is    many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. Not a lot of cool  sexy stuff happening in dentistry. But they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it. It's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system. People brush and floss their teeth. They don't do it as much as they should  but they do it. So I'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in Connecticut cooked up about    years ago. So this is an old experiment  but it's a really good one  because it was very simple  so it's an easy story to tell. So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often  and they were going to use one variable  they wanted to scare them. They wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth. They had a big patient population. They divided them up into two groups. They had a low fear population  where they basically gave them a    minute presentation  all based in science  but told them that  if you didn't brush and floss your teeth  you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease  you will lose your teeth  but you'll get dentures  and it won't be that bad. So that was the low fear group. The high fear group  they laid it on really thick. They showed bloody gums. They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. They told them that their teeth were going to fall out. They said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies  and ultimately  yes  they would lose their teeth. They would get dentures  and if you got dentures  you weren't going to be able to eat corn on the cob  you weren't going to be able to eat apples  you weren't going to be able to eat steak. You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. So go brush and floss your teeth. That was the message. That was the experiment. Now they measured one other variable. They wanted to capture one other variable  which was the patients' sense of efficacy. This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. So they asked them at the beginning   Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program   And the people who said   Yeah  yeah. I'm pretty good about that   they were characterized as high efficacy  and the people who said   Eh  I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should   they were characterized as low efficacy. So the upshot was this. The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. The people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen    it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior. So fear showed up as not really the driver. It was the sense of efficacy. So I want to isolate this  because it was a great observation       years ago  right     years ago    and it's one that's laid fallow in research. It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work  who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment. The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one    that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. In health care terms  you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health  that they can actually see their way towards getting better health  and that's a very important notion. It's an amazing notion. We don't really know how to manipulate it  though  that well. Except  maybe we do. So fear doesn't work  right  Fear doesn't work. And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association. This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. I mean  I showed my three year old this slide last night  and he's like   Papa  why is an ambulance in these people's homes   And I had to explain   They're trying to scare people.  And I don't know if it works. Now here's what does work  personalized information works. Again  Bandura recognized this years ago  decades ago. When you give people specific information about their health  where they stand  and where they want to get to  where they might get to  that path  that notion of a path    that tends to work for behavior change. So let me just spool it out a little bit. So you start with personalized data  personalized information that comes from an individual  and then you need to connect it to their lives. You need to connect it to their lives  hopefully not in a fear based way  but one that they understand. Okay  I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers    this overload of health information that we're inundated with. But it actually hits home. It's not just hitting us in our heads  it's hitting us in our hearts. There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. That information then needs to be connected to choices  needs to be connected to a range of options  directions that we might go to    trade offs  benefits. Finally  we need to be presented with a clear point of action. We need to connect the information always with the action  and then that action feeds back into different information  and it creates  of course  a feedback loop. Now this is a very well observed and well established notion for behavior change. But the problem is that things    in the upper right corner there    personalized data  it's been pretty hard to come by. It's a difficult and expensive commodity  until now. So I'm going to give you an example  a very simple example of how this works. So we've all seen these. These are the  your speed limit  signs. You've seen them all around  especially these days as radars are cheaper. And here's how they work in the feedback loop. So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is     and  of course  you're going faster than that. We always are. We're always going above the speed limit. The choice in this case is pretty simple. We either keep going fast  or we slow down. We should probably slow down  and that point of action is probably now. We should take our foot off the pedal right now  and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down. They reduce speeds by about five to    percent. They last for about five miles  in which case we put our foot back on the pedal. But it works  and it even has some health repercussions. Your blood pressure might drop a little bit. Maybe there's fewer accidents  so there's public health benefits. But by and large  this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. Because in health care  most health care  the data is very removed from the action. It's very difficult to line things up so neatly. But we have an opportunity. So I want to talk about  I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country  how we actually get information. This is a pharmaceutical ad. Actually  it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad. Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet. But it looks completely right. So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information  and it just sounds perfect. And then we turn the page of the magazine  and we see this    now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads  or to follow their ads  and to me  this is one of the most  cynical exercises in medicine. Because we know. Who among us would actually say that people read this  And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it  This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information. There is no good faith in this. So this is a different approach. This is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School  Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin. And they created this thing called the  drug facts box.  They took inspiration from  of all things  Cap'n Crunch. They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal  works for our food  actually helps people understand what's in their food. God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies. So let me just walk through this quickly. It says very clearly what the drug is for  specifically who it is good for  so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you. You can understand exactly what the benefits are. It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what  but you get the statistics for how effective it is. And finally  you understand what those choices are. You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects. Every time you take a drug  you're walking into a possible side effect. So it spells those out in very clean terms  and that works. So I love this. I love that drug facts box. And so I was thinking about  what's an opportunity that I could have to help people understand information  What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use  And so I came up with this  lab test results. Blood test results are this great source of information. They're packed with information. They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. They go right to doctors. And God forbid    I think many doctors  if you really asked them  they don't really understand all this stuff either. This is the worst presented information. You ask Tufte  and he would say   Yes  this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible.  What we did at Wired was we went  and I got our graphic design department to re imagine these lab reports. So that's what I want to walk you through. So this is the general blood work before  and this is the after  this is what we came up with. The after takes what was four pages    that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. It goes on and on and on  all these values  all these numbers you don't know. This is our one page summary. We use the notion of color. It's an amazing notion that color could be used. So on the top level you have your overall results  the things that might jump out at you from the fine print. Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context  and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. In this case  this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level. Likewise  you can go over your lipids and  again  understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. But again  always using color and personalized proximity to that information. All those other values  all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing  we summarize. We tell you that you're okay  you're normal. But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk. And then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop  we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate. And then we go a further step    we tell them what they can do. We give them some insight into what choices they can make  what actions they can take. So that's our general blood work test. Then we went to CRP test. In this case  it's a sin of omission. They have this huge amount of space  and they don't use it for anything  so we do. Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test  or in conjunction with a cholesterol test. So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page  which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed  which might be a risk for heart disease. What you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language. Then we use the information that's already in the lab report. We use the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks. So we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is. The last one I'll show you is a PSA test. Here's the before  and here's the after. Now a lot of our effort on this one    as many of you probably know  a PSA test is a very controversial test. It's used to test for prostate cancer  but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that. We again personalized the risks. So this patient is in their   s  so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is. In this case it's about    percent  based on that. And then again  the follow up actions. So our cost for this was less than        dollars  all right. That's what Wired magazine spent on this. Why is Wired magazine doing this  Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp  the two largest lab testing companies    last year  they made profits of over     million dollars and over     million dollars respectively. Now this is not a problem of resources  this is a problem of incentives. We need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor  should not be the insurance company. It should be the patient. It's the person who actually  in the end  is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors. This is information that is incredibly powerful. It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change. But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. It's being lost. So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask  because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. But you can create your own feedback loop. Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions  Can I have my results  And the only acceptable answer is    What does this mean  Help me understand what the data is. What are my options  What choices are now on the table  And then  what's next  How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life  So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people. You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information  if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. And engagement is essential here  because it's not just giving them information  it's giving them an opportunity to act. That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today. And this information is out there. I've been talking today about latent information  all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use. But there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online  and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people  to help people and to change the course of their lives. Thank you very much. I was afraid of womanhood. Not that I'm not afraid now  but I've learned to pretend. I've learned to be flexible. In fact  I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear. Let me explain. Back in the '  s and '  s  when I was growing up  little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft  and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy    really not quite clear what we were supposed to be. There were plenty of role models all around us. We had our mothers  our aunts  our cousins  our sisters  and of course  the ever present media bombarding us with images and words  telling us how to be. Now my mother was different. She was a homemaker  but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together  and she didn't buy me pink outfits. Instead  she knew what I needed  and she bought me a book of cartoons. And I just ate it up. I drew  and I drew  and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family  I could draw  do what I wanted to do  and not have to perform  not have to speak    I was very shy    and I could still get approval. I was launched as a cartoonist. Now when we're young  we don't always know. We know there are rules out there  but we don't always know    we don't perform them right  even though we are imprinted at birth with these things  and we're told what the most important color in the world is. We're told what shape we're supposed to be in. We're told what to wear       and how to do our hair       and how to behave. Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture. We're being corrected  and the primary policemen are women  because we are the carriers of the tradition. We pass it down from generation to generation. Not only that    we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us. And on top of all off these rules  they keep changing. We don't know what's going on half the time  so it puts us in a very tenuous position. Now if you don't like these rules  and many of us don't    I know I didn't  and I still don't  even though I follow them half the time  not quite aware that I'm following them    what better way than to change them  than  with humor  Humor relies on the traditions of a society. It takes what we know  and it twists it. It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress  and it makes it unexpected  and that's what elicits a laugh. Now what if you put together women and humor  I think you can get change. Because women are on the ground floor  and we know the traditions so well  we can bring a different voice to the table. Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos. I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. during the Civil Rights movement  the assassinations  the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement  and I think I was drawing  trying to figure out what was going on. And then also my family was in chaos  and I drew to try to bring my family together       try to bring my family together with laughter. It didn't work. My parents got divorced  and my sister was arrested. But I found my place. I found that I didn't have to wear high heels  I didn't have to wear pink  and I could feel like I fit in. Now when I was a little older  in my   s  I realized there are not many women in cartooning. And I thought   Well  maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning   and so I did. I became a cartoonist. And then I thought    in my   s I started thinking   Well  why don't I do something  I always loved political cartoons  so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh   Now my perspective is a particularly       my perspective is a particularly American perspective. I can't help it. I live here. Even though I've traveled a lot  I still think like an American woman. But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal  of course    that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions  and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S. Consequently  we have. Women  because we're on the ground  we know the tradition. We have amazing antennae. Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists  which I so enjoy  and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth  to get at the issues quickly and succinctly. And not only that  it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect  but through the heart. My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world    countries such as Saudi Arabia  Iran  Turkey  Argentina  France    and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties. And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances. But I feel blessed to be able to work with them. And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions  because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition keepers  that we can have the great potential to be change agents. And I think  I truly believe  that we can change this thing one laugh at a time. Thank you. The maxim   Know thyself  has been around since the ancient Greeks. Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato  others to Pythagoras. But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first  because it's still sage advice  even today.  Know thyself.  It's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless  but it rings familiar and true  doesn't it   Know thyself.  I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems  or more exactly the confusions  of consciousness. I've always been fascinated with knowing the self. This fascination led me to submerge myself in art  study neuroscience and later to become a psychotherapist. Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon  a thought controlled computing company. My goal  quite simply  is to help people become more in tune with themselves. I take it from this little dictum   Know thyself.  If you think about it  this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species  isn't it  I mean  it's self awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind. Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves. Under the deluge of minute to minute text conversations  emails  relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags  we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place  ourselves. Much of the time we're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves into the world. And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves. We've cluttered ourselves up with all this. And we feel like we have to get far  far away to a secluded retreat  leaving it all behind. So we go far away to the top of a mountain  assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter  the chaotic everyday  and find ourselves again. But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind  what are we really achieving  It's really only a successful escape. Think of the term we use   Retreat.  This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle. It means we've got to get out of here. Is this how we feel about the pressures of our world  that in order to get inside ourselves  you have to run for the hills  And the problem with escaping your day to day life is that you have to come home eventually. So when you think about it  we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there. And eventually that vacation's got to come to an end. So my question to you is  can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape  Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self awareness that we seek  Can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions   Know thyself   I say the answer is yes. And I'm here today to share a new way that we're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before    humanizing technology and furthering that age old quest of ours to more fully know the self. It's called thought controlled computing. You may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead. This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk. These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph. Let me show you what it looks like. That blue line there is my brainwave. It's the direct signal being recorded from my head  rendered in real time. The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency  with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here. You're actually looking inside my head as I speak. These graphs are compelling  they're undulating  but from a human's perspective  they're actually not very useful. That's why we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it. For instance  what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment  Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen  The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head. The more relaxed I am  the more the energy's going to fall through it. I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am  so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side. And the more focused my brain is  the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy. Ordinarily  I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way. As we know  our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable. We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it  and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier. This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves. We're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient  our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever. I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit  but first I want to take a look at how we got here. By the way  feel free to check in on my head at any time. My team at InteraXon and I have been developing throught controlled application for almost a decade now. In the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind. We were making things activate  light up and work just by thinking. We were transcending the space between the mind and the device. We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind  like thought controlled home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair. We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations  and it was really exciting. And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics. We were invited to create a massive installation at the Vancouver      winter Olympics  were used in Vancouver  got to control the lighting on the C.N. Tower  the Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls from all the way across the country using their minds. Over    days at the Olympics       visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the C.N. Tower  parliament and Niagara in real time with their minds from across the country        km away. So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool. But we're always interested in multi tiered levels of human interaction. And so we began looking into inventing thought controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control. And that was responsiveness. We realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you. And it could join into the relationship with you. We created the responsive room where the lights music and blinds adjusted to your state. They followed these little shifts in your mental activity. So as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day  on the couch in our office  the music would mellow with you. When you read  the desk lamp would get brighter. If you nod off  the system would know  dimming to darkness as you do. We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you  there's an even more valuable application than that. That you could know something about yourself. We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden. Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here. Here's an application that I created for the iPad. So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form. So you use it with your headset. The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone. In that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear. In the original Zen Bound game  you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad. In the game that we created  of course  you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind. As you focus on the wooden form  it rotates. The more you focus  the faster the rotation. This is for real. This is not a fake. What's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats and feedback about how you did. You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing    not just how much rope you used or what your high score is  but what was going on inside of your mind. And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves. I like to call this  intra active.  Normally we think about technology as interactive. This technology is intra active. It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward. So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop. At InteraXon  intra active technology is one of our really defining mandates. It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop. For example  thought controlled computing can teach children with ADD how to improve their focus. With ADD  children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states. So you can create applications that reward focused brain states. So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it. This can be as effective as Ritalin. Perhaps even more importantly  thought controlled computing can give children with ADD insights into their own fluctuating mental states  so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs. The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with. We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us  what once mystified and separated us. Brainwave technology can understand us  anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs. Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan. Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight. It would be like plugging into your own personal Google. On the subject of Google  today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them. You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy  or whatever baby animals are to you  and then you can search that database  navigating with your feelings  rather than the keywords that just hint at them. Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention  just like this. Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it. As it aligns with our human behaviors  it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and  more importantly  why  creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are. With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles. When our productivity starts to slacken  we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play. Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self  what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk  Imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest  or what activities brought you joy. Would you make more time for those people  Would you prioritize  Would you get a divorce  What thought controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives. And with this  we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time. We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what's going on. And from this  we can learn how to change the plot  the outcome and the character of our personal stories. Two millennia ago  those Greeks had some powerful insights. They knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase  when you come into contact with yourself. They understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing  evolving and growing. But they understood something more fundamental    the sheer joy in discovery  the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it  the richness that we get from seeing  feeling and knowing the lives that we are. My mom's an artist  and as a child I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush. One moment it was all white space  pure possibility. The next  it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions. As I sat easel side  watching her transform canvas after canvas  I learned that you could create your own world. I learned that our own inner worlds    our ideas  emotions and imaginations    were  in fact  not bound by our brains and bodies. If you could think it  if you could discover it  you could bring it to life. To me  thought controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush    one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us. I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you  easel side  watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves. Thank you. My story actually began when I was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah  Georgia. And this was the     s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after Confederate war generals. We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard. And when I was five  my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting Ray bicycle. It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an orangutan. That's why they were called ape hangers. They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the     s  which I'm sure my mom didn't know. And one day I was exploring this cul de sac hidden away a few streets away. And I came back  and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly  so I decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood  and wham  I was hit by a passing sedan. My mangled body flew in one direction  my mangled bike flew in the other. And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line  and one of my neighbors came running over.  Andy  Andy  how are you doing   she said  using the name of my older brother.  I'm Bruce   I said  and promptly passed out. I broke my left femur that day    it's the largest bone in your body    and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee  and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle. And for the next    years  that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me. In fact  I made a living by walking. I traveled around the world  entered different cultures  wrote a series of books about my travels  including  Walking the Bible.  I hosted a television show by that name on PBS. I was  for all the world  the  walking guy.  Until  in May       a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones. And my doctor  on a whim  sent me to get a full body bone scan  which showed that there was some growth in my left leg. That sent me to an X ray  then to an MRI. And one afternoon  I got a call from my doctor.  The tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor.  I stopped walking  and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative. I have cancer. And to think that the tumor was in the same bone  in the same place in my body as the accident    years earlier    it seemed like too much of a coincidence. So that afternoon  I went back to my house  and my three year old identical twin daughters  Eden and Tybee Feiler  came running to meet me. They'd just turned three  and they were into all things pink and purple. In fact  we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious    although I must say  our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday  April   th. When they were born at      and      on April           our otherwise grim  humorless doctor looked at his watch  and was like   Hmm  April   th    tax day. Early filer and late filer.  The next day I came to see him. I was like   Doctor  that was a really good joke.  And he was like   You're the writer  kid.  Anyway    so they had just turned three  and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground  laughing with all the glee in the world. I crumbled. I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them  the art projects I might not mess up  the boyfriends I might not scowl at  the aisles I might not walk down. Would they wonder who I was  I thought. Would they yearn for my approval  my love  my voice  A few days later  I woke with an idea of how I might give them that voice. I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters' lives.  I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives   I wrote these men.  They'll have loving families and welcoming homes  but they may not have me. They may not have their dad. Will you help be their dad   And I said to myself I would call this group of men  the Council of Dads.  Now as soon as I had this idea  I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay. She's a very upbeat  naturally excited person. There's this idea in this culture    I don't have to tell you    that you sort of  happy  your way through a problem. We should focus on the positive. My wife  as I said  she grew up outside of Boston. She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality. She's got big hair    although  she told me recently  I can't say she has big hair  because if I say she has big hair  people will think she's from Texas. And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia  but not to have hair from Texas. And actually  in her defense  if she were here right now  she would point out that  when we got married in Georgia  there were three questions on the marriage certificate license  the third of which was   Are you related   I said   Look  in Georgia at least we want to know. In Arkansas they don't even ask.  What I didn't tell her is  if she said   Yes   you could jump. You don't need the    day waiting period. Because you don't need the get to know you session at that point. So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea  but the next day I couldn't control myself  I told her. And she loved the idea  but she quickly started rejecting my nominees. She was like   Well  I love him  but I would never ask him for advice.  So it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends. So we decided that we needed a set of rules  and we came up with a number. And the first one was no family  only friends. We thought our family would already be there. Second  men only. We were trying to fill the dad space in the girls' lives. And then third  sort of a dad for every side. We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing. So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men. And rather than send it  I decided to read it to them in person. Linda  my wife  joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals. I sort of friend married each of these guys. And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin. Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe when I graduated from high school in the early     s. And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle. And I snuck out behind  and there was a moat  a fence and a field of cows. And Jeff came up beside me and said   So  have you ever been cow tipping   I was like   Cow tipping  He was like   Yeah. Cows sleep standing up. So if you approach them from behind  down wind  you can push them over and they go thud in the mud.  So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not  we had jumped the moat  we had climbed the fence  we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor  dozing cow. So a few weeks after my diagnosis  we went up to Vermont  and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads. And we went to this apple orchard  and I read him this letter.  Will you help be their dad   And I got to the end    he was crying and I was crying    and then he looked at me  and he said   Yes.  I was like   Yes   I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter. And frankly  although I keep getting asked this  it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances. And then I asked him a question  which I ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book. And that was   What's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls   And Jeff's advice was   Be a traveller  not a tourist. Get off the bus. Seek out what's different. Approach the cow.   So it's    years from now   I said   and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad  and I'm not here. What would you tell them   He said   I would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle. You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple  or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like  what it smells like.  And as he talked he had that glint in his eye that I first saw back in Holland    the glint that says   Let's go cow tipping   even though we never did tip the cow  even though no one tips the cow  even though cows don't sleep standing up. He said   I want to see you back here girls  at the end of this experience  covered in mud.  Two weeks after my diagnosis  a biopsy confirmed I had a seven inch osteosarcoma in my left femur. Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma. Eighty five percent are under   . Only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases. Twenty years ago  doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped  and there was a    percent survival rate. And then in the     's  they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective  and within weeks I had started that regimen. And since we are in a medical room  I went through four and a half months of chemo. Actually I had Cisplatin  Doxorubicin and very high dose Methotrexate. And then I had a    hour surgery in which my surgeon  Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York  took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium. And if you did see the Sanjay special  you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis. Then he took my fibula from my calf  cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh  where it now lives. And what he actually did was he de vascularized it from my calf and re vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip. And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle. This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. And my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo. It was  as we said in my house  a lost year. Because in those opening weeks  we all had nightmares. And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house  sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. And I remember a particular one night that  when you told that story of    I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland    of William Sloane Coffin    it made me think of it. Because I was in the hospital after  I think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero  and I had basically no immune system. And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body. And one night I got a call from my mother in law that my daughters  at that time three and a half  were missing me and feeling my absence. And I hung up the phone  and I put my face in my hands  and I screamed this silent scream. And what you said  Dr. Nuland    I don't know where you are    made me think of this today. Because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that I had was like a primal scream. And what was so striking    and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today    is the experience. As I became less and less human    and at this moment in my life  I was probably    pounds less than I am right now. Of course  I had no hair and no immune system. They were actually putting blood inside my body. At that moment I was less and less human  I was also  at the same time  maybe the most human I've ever been. And what was so striking about that time was  instead of repulsing people  I was actually proving to be a magnet for people. People were incredibly drawn. When my wife and I had kids  we thought it would be all hands on deck. Instead  it was everybody running the other way. And when I had cancer  we thought it'd be everybody running the other way. Instead  it was all hands on deck. And when people came to me  rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw    I was like a living ghost    they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives. Cancer  I found  is a passport to intimacy. It is an invitation  maybe even a mandate  to enter the most vital arenas of human life  the most sensitive and the most frightening  the ones that we never want to go to  but when we do go there  we feel incredibly transformed when we do. And this also happened to my girls as they began to see  and  we thought  maybe became an ounce more compassionate. One day  my daughter Tybee  Tybee came to me  and she said   I have so much love for you in my body  daddy  I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses. And when I have no more love left  I just drink milk  because that's where love comes from.  And one night my daughter Eden came to me. And as I lifted my leg out of bed  she reached for my crutches and handed them to me. In fact  if I cling to one memory of this year  it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand. I didn't need the crutch anymore  I was walking on air. And one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people. And it made me think    and I'll just note for the record    one word that I've only heard once actually was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday    the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word  friend.  And yet from everything we've been talking about    compliance  or addiction  or weight loss    we now know that community is important  and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in. And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me. And one of the things that I learned is that over time  particularly men  who used to be non communicative  are becoming more and more communicative. And that particularly happened    there was one in my life    is this Council of Dads that Linda said  what we were talking about  it's like what the moms talk about at school drop off. And no one captures this modern manhood to me more than David Black. Now David is my literary agent. He's about five foot three and a half on a good day  standing fully upright in cowboy boots. And on kind of the manly male front  he answers the phone    I can say this I guess because you've done it here    he answers the phone   Yo  motherfucker.  He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine  and on his   th birthday he bought a convertible sports car    although  like a lot of men  he's impatient  he bought it on his   th. But like a lot of modern men  he hugs  he bakes  he leaves work early to coach Little League. Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads. I was like   David cries when you invite him to take a walk.  But he's a literary agent  which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true. And this is what we wanted him to capture    what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations. And I said   What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer   And he said   A belief in themselves.   But when I came to see you   I said   I didn't believe in myself. I was at a wall.  He said   I don't see the wall   and I'm telling you the same  Don't see the wall. You may encounter one from time to time  but you've got to find a way to get over it  around it  or through it. But whatever you do  don't succumb to it. Don't give in to the wall. My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge  and during the year and a half I was on crutches  it became a sort of symbol to me. So one day near the end of my journey  I said   Come on girls  let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.  We set out on crutches. I was on crutches  my wife was next to me  my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead. And because walking was one of the first things I lost  I spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts. Walking upright  we are told  is the threshold of what made us human. And yet  for the four million years humans have been walking upright  the act is essentially unchanged. As my physical therapist likes to say   Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen.  You nearly fall with one leg  then you catch yourself with the other. And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches    as I did for a year and a half    is that you walk slower. You hurry  you get where you're going  but you get there alone. You go slow  you get where you're going  but you get there with this community you built along the way. At the risk of admission  I was never nicer than the year I was on crutches.     years ago  a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris. He was called a  flaneur   one who wanders the arcades. And it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace. And I just love this ode to slow moving. And it's become my own motto for my girls. Take a walk with a turtle. Behold the world in pause. And this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey. There's a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell  and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus  that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow. And every seven sets of seven years  the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love. That   th year is called the jubilee year  and it's the origin of that term. And though I'm shy of     it captures my own experience. My lost year was my jubilee year. By laying fallow  I planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones I love. Come the one year anniversary of my journey  I went to see my surgeon  Dr. John Healey    and by the way  Healey  great name for a doctor. He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage  which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard. And I said   Dr. Healey  if my daughters come to you one day and say  'What should I learn from my daddy's story ' what would you tell them   He said   I would tell them what I know  and that is everybody dies  but not everybody lives. I want you to live.  I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book   The Council of Dads   and I listed these lessons  a few of which you've heard here today  Approach the cow  pack your flipflops  don't see the wall  live the questions  harvest miracles. As I looked at this list    to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living    I realized  we may have done it for our girls  but it really changed us. And that is  the secret of the Council of Dads  is that my wife and I did this in an attempt to help our daughters  but it really changed us. So I stand here today as you see now  walking without crutches or a cane. And last week I had my    month scans. And as you all know  anybody with cancer has to get follow up scans. In my case it's quarterly. And all the collective minds in this room  I dare say  can never find a solution for scan xiety. As I was going there  I was wondering  what would I say depending on what happened here. I got good news that day  and I stand here today cancer free  walking without aid and hobbling forward. And I just want to mention briefly in passing    I'm past my time limit    but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is  at a similar meeting  back in the spring  Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly    in a span of three weeks    put the full resources of   andMe  and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the genome of anybody  a living person with a heart tissue  bone sarcoma. And she told me last night  in the three months since we've done it  we've gotten     people who've contributed to this program. And the epidemiologists here will tell you  that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. So if you go to   andMe  or if you go to councilofdads.com  you can click on a link. And we encourage anybody to join this effort. But I'll just close what I've been talking about by leaving you with this message  May you find an excuse to reach out to some long lost pal  or to that college roommate  or to some person you may have turned away from. May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace  or find a way to get over  around  or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams. And every now and then  find a friend  find a turtle  and take a long  slow walk. Thank you very much. I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land  from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan  has really shaped our history and our character. But one thing is clear. In the last     years alone  our country    and this is a sprawl map of America    our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet. And so  how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re imagine these connections and physically rebuild them. This graph represents what we're dealing with now in the built environment. And it's really a conflux of urban population rising  biodiversity plummeting and also  of course  sea levels rising and climate changing. So when I also think about design  I think about trying to rework and re engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way. And you can see from the arrow here indicating  you are here   I'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology  and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way. So the era of big infrastructure is over. I mean  these sort of top down  mono functional  capital intensive solutions are really not going to cut it. We need new tools and new approaches. Similarly  the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field  devoid of context  is really not the    excuse me  it's fairly blatant    is really not the approach that we need to take. So we need new stories  new heroes and new tools. So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war  and that is the eastern oyster. So  albeit a very small creature and very modest  this creature is incredible  because it can agglomerate into these mega reef structures. It can grow  you can grow it  and    did I mention     it's quite tasty. So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called  oyster tecture.  And the core idea of oyster tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels  eelgrass and oysters    species that live in the harbor    and  at the same time  harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now. Here's a map of my city  New York City  showing inundation in red. And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about  the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. If you look here at this map  showing everything in blue is out in the water  and everything in yellow is upland. But you can see  even just intuit  from this map  that the harbor has dredged and flattened  and went from a rich  three dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly    I will admit it. There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination  but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition  and it's a condition that we're all facing. And here's a map of that condition  showing the contaminants in yellow and green  exacerbated by this new flow of storm surge and sea level rise. So we really had a lot to deal with. When we started this project  one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there. And you can see from this map  there's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement. We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself. So our concept is really this back to the future concept  harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern. And the idea has two core stages. One is to develop a new artificial ecology  a reef out in the harbor  that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus. Because if you have cleaner water and slower water  you can imagine a new way of living with that water. So the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way  I think. Here we are  back to our hero  the oyster. And again  it's this incredibly exciting animal. It accepts algae and detritus in one end  and through this beautiful  glamorous set of stomach organs  out the other end comes cleaner water. And one oyster can filter up to    gallons of water a day. Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days. They were key in our culture and our economy. Basically  New York was built on the backs of oystermen  and our streets were literally built over oyster shells. This image is an image of an oyster cart  which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. So again  we got the short end of the deal there. Finally  oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures. They really become nature's wave attenuators. And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem. Many  many species depend on them. So we were inspired by the oyster  but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster. It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat  which is when they're floating through the water  and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster  to an adult male oyster or female oyster  in a number of weeks. We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus  then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive. How does the reef work  Well  it's very  very simple. A core concept here is that climate change isn't something that    the answers won't land down from the Moon. And with a     billion price tag  we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us. So this image is simply showing    it's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope. What is fuzzy rope  you ask  It's just that  it's this very inexpensive thing  available practically at your hardware store  and it's very cheap. So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project. So in the studio  rather than drawing  we began to learn how to knit. The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on. You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change. It also creates this incredibly interesting  I think  new amphibious public space  where you can imagine working  you can imagine recreating in a new way. In the end  what we realized we were making was a new blue green watery park for the next watery century    an amphibious park  if you will. So get your Tevas on. So you can imagine scuba diving here. This is an image of high school students  scuba divers that we worked with on our team. So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water  and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring. Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world  this is the word  flupsy     it's short for  floating upwelling system.  And this glorious  readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below. So the water is churned through this raft. You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force feed them. So rather than having    oysters  you have        oysters. And then those spat are then seeded. Here's the Gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines    the flupsification of the Gowanus. New word. And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges. And finally  how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef. I get asked two questions about this project. One is  why isn't it happening now  And the second one is  when can we eat the oysters  And the answer is  not yet  they're working. But we imagine  with our calculations  that by       you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster. To conclude  this is just one cross section of one piece of city  but my dream is  my hope is  that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable  a more livable and a more delicious future. Thank you. I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it  and that is all of us are makers. I really believe that. All of us are makers. We're born makers. We have this ability to make things  to grasp things with our hands. We use words like  grasp  metaphorically to also think about understanding things. We don't just live  but we make. We create things. Well I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places. It doesn't come out particularly well  but that's a particularly tall bicycle. It's a scraper bike  it's called    from Oakland. And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. But he's trying to power it  or motorize it  with a drill. And the question he had is   Can I do it  Can it be done   Apparently it can. So makers are enthusiasts  they're amateurs  they're people who love doing what they do. They don't always even know why they're doing it. We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire. There was one held in Detroit here last summer  and it will be held again next summer  at the Henry Ford. But we hold them in San Francisco       and in New York. And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation. Dale Dougherty  These are electric muffins. Guy  Where did you guys get those  Muffin  Will you glide with us   Guy  No.  DD  I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out. We got there first. Lady  Will you glide with us  DD  This is something I call  swinging in the rain.  And you can barely see it  but it's    a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc. So imagine a kid   Am I going to get wet  Am I going to get wet  No  I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet  Am I going to get wet   That's the experience of a clever ride. And of course  we have fashion. People are remaking things into fashion. I don't know if this is called a basket bra  but it ought to be something like that. We have art students getting together  taking old radiator parts and doing an iron pour to make something new out of it. They did that in the summer  and it was very warm. Now this one takes a little bit of explaining. You know what those are  right  Billy Bob  or Billy Bass  or something like that. Now the background is    the guy who did this is a physicist. And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does. and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. Choir    When you hold me in your arms   DD  This is all computer controlled in an old Volvo. Choir    I'm hooked on a feelin'     I'm high on believin'     That you're in love with me   DD  So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. So  are you a maker  How many people here would say you're a maker  if you raise your hand  That's a pretty good    but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers. And again  think about it. You're makers of food  you're makers of shelter  you're makers of lots of different things  and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world  and particularly the role that technology has in your life. You're really a driver or a passenger    to use a Volkswagen phrase. Makers are in control. That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do. They want to figure out how things work  they want to get access to it  and they want to control it. They want to use it to their own purpose. Makers today  to some degree  are out on the edge. They're not mainstream. They're a little bit radical. They're a bit subversive in what they do. But at one time  it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker. It was not something you'd even remark upon. And I found this old video. And I'll tell you more about it  but just ... we are makers. With our strengths and our minds and spirit  we gather  we form  and we fashion. Makers and shapers and put it togetherers. DD  So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood  a grandfather making a ship in a bottle  a woman making a pie    somewhat standard fare of the day. But it was a sense of pride that we made things  that the world around us was made by us. It didn't just exist. We made it  and we were connected to it that way. And I think that's tremendously important. Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this. This particular reel    it's an industrial video    but it was shown in drive in theaters in         in the Detroit area  in fact    and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's  Psycho.  So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this  plus  Psycho.  This is Andrew Archer. I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth  Minnesota. And I talked to his mom  and I ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called Kidrobot. He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. He liked to take things apart. His mother gave him a part of the garage  and he collected things from yard sales  and he made stuff. And then he didn't particularly like school that much  but he got involved in robotics competitions  and he realized he had a talent  and  more importantly  he had a real passion for it. And he began building robots. And when I sat down next to him  he was telling me about a company he formed  and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor. And that's why he moved to Michigan. But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing. And this kind of gets to this important idea today. This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hackerspace. And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit. And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last. But these are like clubs    they're sharing tools  sharing space  sharing expertise in what to make. And so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world. But essentially these are people that are playing with technology. Let me say that again  playing. They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it. They're playing to discover what the technology can do  and probably to discover what they can do themselves  what their own capabilities are. Now the other thing that I think is taking off  another reason making is taking off today  is there's some great new tools out there. And you can't see this very well on the screen  but Arduino    Arduino is an open source hardware platform. It's a micro controller. If you don't know what those are  they're just the  brains.  So they're the brains of maker projects  and here's an example of one. And I don't know if you can see it that well  but that's a mailbox    so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. So you figure out how to program this  and you put this in your mailbox. And when someone opens your mailbox  you get a notification  an alert message goes to your iPhone. Now that could be a dog door  it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't  like a little brother into a little sister's room. There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that. Now here's something    a  D printer. That's another tool that's really taken off    really  really interesting. This is Makerbot. And there are industrial versions of this    about        dollars. These guys came up with a kit version for     dollars  and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with  D printers. Now they don't know what they want to do with it  but they're going to figure it out. They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it. One of the coolest things is  Makerbot sent out an upgrade  some new brackets for the box. Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones. Isn't that cool  So makers harvest technology from all the places around us. This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy. And they do interesting things. They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think    the military is doing drones    well  there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes  or vehicles    something that you could program to fly on its own  without a stick or anything  to figure out what path it's going. Fascinating work they're doing. We just had an issue on space exploration  DIY space exploration. This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space. You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like       dollars. Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space. In fact  these guys actually work for NASA  and they're trying to pioneer using off the shelf components  cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space. Makers are a source of innovation  and I think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry. This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers  It's the Homebrew Computer Club    just like a hackerspace. And he says   I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free.  Well he did a little bit better than free. But it's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries    even like Henry Ford    come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups. Well  if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker  I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers  that kids are particularly interested in this  in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro controllers and build robots. And we've got to get this into schools  or into communities in many  many ways    the ability to tinker  to shape and reshape the world around us. There's a great opportunity today    and that's what I really care about the most. An the answer to the question  what will America make  It's more makers. Thank you very much. I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy  social media and the end of gender. Let me connect the dots. I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love  or love to hate  are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender. If you hadn't noticed  our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender  and I think that's going to change. Now most media companies    television  radio  publishing  games  you name it    they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences. It's old school demographics. They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us. Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways    you have certain taste  that you like certain things. And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics. Age demographics  the    to    demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the     s  when the baby boomers were still young. Now they've aged out of that demographic  but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age   . In our media environment  it's as if they don't even exist. Now  if you watch  Mad Men   like I do    it's a popular TV show in the States    Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics  which first came about in the     s  where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers. But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. It's really just been basic demographics. So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC  and we've done a lot of research over the last seven  eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. And in the last three years  we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed  and we've discovered some very interesting things. All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. But those categories mean even less now than they did before  because with online networking tools  it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes. We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. And we can lie about our age online  too  pretty easily. We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests. We don't need a media company to help do this for us. So the traditional media companies  of course  are paying very close attention to these online communities. They know this is the mass audience of the future  they need to figure it out. But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them  because that's how ad rates are still determined. When they're monitoring your clickstream    and you know they are    they have a really hard time figuring out your age  your gender and your income. They can make some educated guesses. But they get a lot more information about what you do online  what you like  what interests you. That's easier for them to find out than who you are. And even though that's still sort of creepy  there is an upside to having your taste monitored. Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. It had been presumed before. So when you look online at the way people aggregate  they don't aggregate around age  gender and income. They aggregate around the things they love  the things that they like  and if you think about it  shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories. I'd much rather know whether you like  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  rather than how old you are. That would tell me something more substantial about you. Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. If you look at the statistics    these are worldwide statistics    in every single age category  women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites  they truly dominate the social media space  which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media. The question is  what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture  and what's it going to mean for women  If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media  then does that mean that women are going to take over global media  Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows  Will the next big budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks  Could this be possible  that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape  Well  I actually don't think that's going to be the case. I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women  because they realize this is important for their business  and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere. But I think women are actually going to be    ironically enough    responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the  chick flick  and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things    that Hispanics like certain things  that young people like certain things. This is far too simplistic. The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data driven  and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online  where women are really driving the action. So you may be asking  well why is it important that I know what entertains people  Why should I know this  Of course  old media companies and advertisers need to know this. But my argument is that  if you want to understand the global village  it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about  what amuses them  what they choose to do in their free time. This is a very important thing to know about people. I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. And I do it not just because it's fun    though actually  it is really fun    but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives    for instance  on their political beliefs and on their health. And so  if you have any interest in understanding the world  looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start. So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. Can you even imagine what that looks like  I can't wait to find out what it looks like. Thank you so much. Running    it's basically just right  left  right  left    yeah  I mean  we've been doing it for two million years  so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. But the cool thing about running  as I've discovered  is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time. Case in point  A couple months ago  if you saw the New York City Marathon  I guarantee you  you saw something that no one has ever seen before. An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line. She's    years old  she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years  and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth. Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport  but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event  the New York City Marathon. Except    bad news for Derartu Tulu    some other people had the same idea  including the Olympic gold medalist and Paula Radcliffe  who is a monster  the fastest woman marathoner in history by far. Only    minutes off the men's world record  Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable. That's her competition. The gun goes off  and she's not even an underdog. She's under the underdogs. But the under underdog hangs tough  and    miles into a    mile race  there is Derartu Tulu up there with the lead pack. Now this is when something really bizarre happens. Paula Radcliffe  the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of Derartu Tulu's under underdog hands  suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back. So we all know what to do in this situation  right  You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line. Derartu Tulu ruins the script. Instead of taking off  she falls back  and she grabs Paula Radcliffe  says   Come on. Come with us. You can do it.  So Paula Radcliffe  unfortunately  does it. She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line. But then she falls back again. And the second time Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her. And Paula Radcliffe at that point says   I'm done. Go.  So that's a fantastic story  and we all know how it ends. She loses the check  but she goes home with something bigger and more important. Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again    instead of losing  she blazes past the lead pack and wins  wins the New York City Marathon  goes home with a big fat check. It's a heartwarming story  but if you drill a little bit deeper  you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there. When you have two outliers in one organism  it's not a coincidence. When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race  again  it's not a coincidence. You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills  somehow water's involved. Someone with that kind of heart  there's some kind of connection there. And the answer to it  I think  can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico  where there's a tribe  a reclusive tribe  called the Tarahumara Indians. Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. Number one is  they have been living essentially unchanged for the past     years. When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices  you either fight back and engage or you could take off. The Mayans and Aztecs engaged  which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs. The Tarahumara had a different strategy. They took off and hid in this labyrinthine  networking  spiderwebbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons  and there they remained since the     s    essentially the same way they've always been. The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is  deep into old age       to    years old    these guys aren't running marathons  they're running mega marathons. They're not doing    miles  they're doing          miles at a time  and apparently without injury  without problems. The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is that all the things that we're going to be talking about today  all the things that we're trying to come up with using all of our technology and brain power to solve    things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression    all this stuff  the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about. They are free from all of these modern ailments. So what's the connection  Again  we're talking about outliers    there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there. Well  there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries. And once again  a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery    perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries  which go like this  three things    if you have the answer  come up and take the microphone  because nobody else knows the answer. And if you know it  then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth. Mystery number one is this  Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size. Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain. Suddenly humans show up    Homo erectus    big  old melon head. To have a brain of that size  you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy. In other words  early humans are eating dead animals    no argument  that's a fact. The only problem is  the first edged weapons only appeared about         years ago. So  somehow  for nearly two million years  we are killing animals without any weapons. Now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle. Every other animal is stronger than we are    they have fangs  they have claws  they have nimbleness  they have speed. We think Usain Bolt is fast. Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel. We're not fast. That would be an Olympic event  turn a squirrel loose    whoever catches the squirrel  you get a gold medal. So no weapons  no speed  no strength  no fangs  no claws    how were we killing these animals  Mystery number one. Mystery number two  Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now  but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters    they all suck  they're terrible. There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been. The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in     . I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than     . For some reason you guys are just really slow. But you get to the marathon we were just talking about    you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for    years. Because  prior to the     s  medical science said that if a woman tried to run    miles    does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run    miles  why you were banned from the marathon before the     s  Yes. You would have torn reproductive organs. The uterus would fall out  literally fall out of the body. Now I've been to a lot of marathons  and I've yet to see any ... So it's only been    years that women have been allowed to run the marathon. In that very short learning curve  you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only    minutes off the male world record. Then you go beyond    miles  into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans    remember Pheidippides died when he ran    miles    you get to    and     miles  and suddenly it's a different game. You can take a runner like Ann Trason  or Nikki Kimball  or Jenn Shelton  you put them in a race of    or     miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who's going to win. I'll give you an example. A couple years ago  Emily Baer signed up for a race called the Hardrock      which tells you all you need to know about the race. They give you    hours to finish this race. Well Emily Baer        runners    she finishes in eighth place  in the top     even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race    and yet  beat     other people. So why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer  The third mystery is this  At the University of Utah  they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon. And what they found is that  if you start running the marathon at age     you will get progressively faster  year by year  until you reach your peak at age   . And then after that  you succumb to the rigors of time. And you'll get slower and slower  until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age   . So about seven years  eight years to reach your peak  and then gradually you fall off your peak  until you go back to the starting point. You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed  maybe    years    no  it's    years.    year old men and women are running as fast as they were at age   . Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity    and please don't say golf    something that actually is hard    where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers. So you have these three mysteries. Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up  You've got to be really careful any time someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer  because  it being prehistory  you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it. But I'll submit this to you  If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle  suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture. If you wonder  why it is the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease  why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive  and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons  perhaps it's because humans  as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe  actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs. Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal. Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness    again  it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed    the only thing we do really  really well is sweat. We're really good at being sweaty and smelly. Better than any other mammal on Earth  we can sweat really well. But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that  when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances  we're superb  we're the best on the planet. You take a horse on a hot day  and after about five or six miles  that horse has a choice. It's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off  but it ain't doing both    we can. So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals  What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group  go out there on that African Savannah  pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death  That's all we could do. We could run really far on a hot day. Well if that's true  a couple other things had to be true as well. The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word  pack.  If you go out by yourself  and you try to chase an antelope  I guarantee you there's going to be two cadavers out there in the Savannah. You need a pack to pull together. You need to have those         year olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're actually trying to catch. The herd explodes and it gathers back again. Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack. They can't be    miles behind. You need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent. It makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead and the people who want to eat it    miles away. They need to be part of the pack. You need to have those    year old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill  and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved. The pack stays together. Another thing that has to be true about this pack  this pack cannot be really materialistic. You can't be hauling all your crap around  trying to chase the antelope. You can't be a pissed off pack. You can't be bearing grudges  like   I'm not chasing that guy's antelope. He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope.  The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego  be cooperative and pull together. What you end up with  in other words  is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara    a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age. It's a really compelling argument that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years  that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path. You know  we look at running as this kind of alien  foreign thing  this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. But maybe it's something different. Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it. How do we spoil it  Well how do we spoil anything  We try to cash in on it. We try to can it and package it and make it  better  and sell it to people. And what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things  which can make running  better   called running shoes. The reason I get personally pissed off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt. And I think that  if anybody in here runs    and I just had a conversation with Carol  we talked for two minutes backstage  and she's talking about plantar fasciitis. You talk to a runner  I guarantee  within    seconds  the conversation turns to injury. So if humans evolved as runners  if that's our one natural advantage  why are we so bad at it  Why do we keep getting hurt  Curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time. If you read folklore and mythology  any kind of myths  any kind of tall tales  running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor. It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain. Geronimo used to say that   My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs.  That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run    miles across the desert  engage in hand to hand combat  steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home. Geronimo was never saying   Ah  you know something  my achilles    I'm tapering. I got to take this week off   or  I need to cross train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready.  Humans ran and ran all the time. We are here today. We have our digital technology. All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day  which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances. So how do we get back to that again  Well  I would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging  all the sales  all the marketing. Get rid of all the stinking running shoes. Stop focusing on urban marathons  which  if you do four hours  you suck. If you do          you're awesome  because you qualified for another race. We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and  I would say  nakedness  that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time. So what's the benefit  So what  So you burn off the Haagen Dazs from the night before  But maybe there's another benefit there as well. Without getting a little too extreme about this  imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed  more serene  more healthy  burn off stress    where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore  where you don't go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again. Maybe there's something between what we are today and what the Tarahumara have always been. I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize  which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet  but maybe there's somewhere in between. And if we find that thing  maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there. Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence  up until the     s or so  the benefits  social and physical and political and mental  could be astounding. So what I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners  people who got rid of their shoes. And what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes  you get rid of the stress  you get rid of the injuries and the ailments. And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time  that this can be a whole lot of fun. I've experienced it personally myself. I was injured all my life  and then in my early   s I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too. So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from. And I appreciate you guys listening to this story. Thanks very much.  What I Will  I will not dance to your war drum. I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum. I will not dance to that beating. I know that beat. It is lifeless. I know intimately that skin you are hitting. It was alive once  hunted  stolen  stretched. I will not dance to your drummed up war. I will not pop  spin  break for you. I will not hate for you or even hate you. I will not kill for you. Especially I will not die for you. I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide. I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. Everyone can be wrong. Life is a right  not collateral or casual. I will not forget where I come from. I will craft my own drum. Gather my beloved near  and our chanting will be dancing. Our humming will be drumming. I will not be played. I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat. I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance. This heartbeat is louder than death. Your war drum ain't louder than this breath. Haaa. What's up TED people  Let me hear you make some noise. A bunch of pacifists. Confused  aspiring pacifists. I understand. I've been wrong a lot lately. Like a lot. So I couldn't figure out what to read today. I mean  I've been saying I've been prepping. What that means is prepping my outfit  prepping options  trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. Poetry does that. It preps you. It aims you. So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. But I'm going to need you to just sit for like    minutes and hold a woman who is not here. Hold her now with you. You don't need to say her name out loud  you can just hold her. Are you holding her  This is  Break Clustered.  All holy history banned. Unwritten books predicted the future  projected the past. But my head unwraps around what appears limitless  man's creative violence. Whose son shall it be  Which male child will perish a new day  Our boys' deaths galvanize. We cherish corpses. We mourn women  complicated. Bitches get beat daily. Profits made  prophets ignored. War and tooth  enameled salted lemon childhoods. All colors run  none of us solid. Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within. I live cycles of light and darkness. Rhythm is half silence. I see now  I never was one and not the other. Sickness  health  tender violence. I think now I never was pure. Before form I was storm  blind  ign'ant    still am. Human contracted itself blind  malignant. I never was pure. Girl spoiled before ripened. Language can't math me. I experience exponentially. Everything is everything. One woman loses     maybe     members of her family. One woman loses six. One woman loses her head. One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash. One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. One woman straps herself. One woman gives birth to a baby. One woman gives birth to borders. One woman no longer believes love will ever find her. One woman never did. Where do refugee hearts go  Broken  dissed  placed where they're not from  don't want to be missed. Faced with absence. We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all. My spine curves spiral. Precipice running to and running from human beings. Cluster bombs left behind. De facto landmines. A smoldering grief. Harvest contaminated tobacco. Harvest bombs. Harvest baby teeth. Harvest palms  smoke. Harvest witness  smoke. Resolutions  smoke. Salvation  smoke. Redemption  smoke. Breathe. Do not fear what has blown up. If you must  fear the unexploded. Thank you. What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request. I'd like all of you to pause for a moment  you wretched weaklings  and take stock of your miserable existence. Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century. It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned   . Up until that moment  I had been that classic corporate warrior    I was eating too much  I was drinking too much  I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family. And I decided that I would try and turn my life around. In particular  I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work life balance. So I stepped back from the workforce  and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children. But all I learned about work life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work. Not a very useful skill  especially when the money runs out. So I went back to work  and I've spent these seven years since struggling with  studying and writing about work life balance. And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today. The first is  if society's to make any progress on this issue  we need an honest debate. But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work life balance. All the discussions about flexi time or dress down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue  which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day to day basis with a young family. Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in. And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet  screaming desperation  where they work long  hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like. It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and  a  T shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue. The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us. We should stop looking outside. It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead. If you don't design your life  someone else will design it for you  and you may just not like their idea of balance. It's particularly important    this isn't on the World Wide Web  is it  I'm about to get fired    it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies    the  abattoirs of the human soul   as I call them. I'm talking about all companies. Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you  as  they can get away with. It's in their nature  it's in their DNA  it's what they do    even the good  well intentioned companies. On the one hand  putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened. On the other hand  it's a nightmare    it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life. The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance. Before I went back to work after my year at home  I sat down and I wrote out a detailed  step by step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to. And it went like this  wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have breakfast with my wife and children. Have sex again. Drive the kids to school on the way to the office. Do three hours' work. Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime. Do another three hours' work. Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink. Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids. Meditate for half an hour. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have sex again. Go to bed. How often do you think I have that day  We need to be realistic. You can't do it all in one day. We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life  but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the  I'll have a life when I retire  when my kids have left home  when my wife has divorced me  my health is failing  I've got no mates or interests left.  A day is too short   after I retire  is too long. There's got to be a middle way. A fourth observation  We need to approach balance in a balanced way. A friend came to see me last year    and she doesn't mind me telling this story    a friend came to see me last year and said   Nigel  I've read your book. And I realize that my life is completely out of balance. It's totally dominated by work. I work    hours a day  I commute two hours a day. All of my relationships have failed. There's nothing in my life apart from my work. So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out. So I joined a gym.  Now I don't mean to mock  but being a fit    hour a day office rat isn't more balanced  it's more fit. Lovely though physical exercise may be  there are other parts to life    there's the intellectual side  there's the emotional side  there's the spiritual side. And to be balanced  I believe we have to attend to all of those areas    not just do    stomach crunches. Now that can be daunting. Because people say   Bloody hell mate  I haven't got time to get fit. You want me to go to church and call my mother.  And I understand. I truly understand how that can be daunting. But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective. My wife  who is somewhere in the audience today  called me up at the office and said   Nigel  you need to pick our youngest son     Harry     up from school.  Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening. So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. We walked down to the local park  messed around on the swings  played some silly games. I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe  and we shared a pizza for two  then walked down the hill to our home  and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas. I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's  James and the Giant Peach.  I then put him to bed  tucked him in  gave him a kiss on his forehead and said   Goodnight  mate   and walked out of his bedroom. As I was walking out of his bedroom  he said   Dad   I went   Yes  mate   He went   Dad  this has been the best day of my life  ever.  I hadn't done anything  hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation. Now my point is the small things matter. Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life. With the smallest investment in the right places  you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life. Moreover  I think  it can transform society. Because if enough people do it  we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins  to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. And that  I think  is an idea worth spreading. Ever since I was a little girl seeing  Star Wars  for the first time  I've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots. And as a little girl  I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful  trusted sidekick    something that would delight us  enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. I knew robots like that didn't really exist  but I knew I wanted to build them. So    years pass    I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence  the year is       and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. But robots are still not in our home  ironically. And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case. But one really struck me. Robotics had really been about interacting with things  not with people    certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. For me  that was the white space  that's what robots could not do yet. And so that year  I started to build this robot  Kismet  the world's first social robot. Three years later    a lot of programming  working with other graduate students in the lab    Kismet was ready to start interacting with people. Kismet   Nonsense  Scientist  This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Kismet   Nonsense  Scientist  Yeah  look  it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. Cynthia Breazeal  So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non verbal child or pre verbal child  which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind. It didn't speak language  but it didn't matter. This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us    and with that  the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots. So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots  now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students. And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo. This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo  introducing Leo to a new object. And because it's new  Leo doesn't really know what to make of it. But sort of like us  he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction. Leo  this is Cookie Monster. Can you find Cookie Monster  Leo  Cookie Monster is very bad. He's very bad  Leo. Cookie Monster is very  very bad. He's a scary monster. He wants to get your cookies. CB  All right  so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start  but they get along great now. So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology  where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. And with that shift in thinking  we can now start to imagine new questions  new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise. But what do I mean when I say  push our social buttons   Well  one of the things that we've learned is that  if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language  the same sort of non verbal cues that people use    like Nexi  our humanoid robot  is doing here    what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is  how likable  how engaging  how trustworthy. It turns out it's the same for robots. It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. To answer questions like  how is it that  from a brief encounter  we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is  Mimicry's believed to play a role  but how  Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters  It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically. We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. But with the robot  you can. And so in this video here    this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University. He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with. There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. And the bottom line is    the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. So given that key insight  we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots. For instance  if robots do respond to our non verbal cues  maybe they would be a cool  new communication technology. So imagine this  What about a robot accessory for your cellphone  You call your friend  she puts her handset in a robot  and  bam  You're a MeBot    you can make eye contact  you can talk with your friends  you can move around  you can gesture    maybe the next best thing to really being there  or is it  To explore this question  my student  Siggy Adalgeirsson  did a study where we brought human participants  people  into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table  discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task    this ended up being a survival task    and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants. The first was just the screen. This is just like video conferencing today. The next was to add mobility    so  have the screen on a mobile base. This is like  if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today    this is mirroring that situation. And then the fully expressive MeBot. So after the interaction  we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology  with a remote collaborator through this technology  in a number of different ways. We looked at psychological involvement    how much empathy did you feel for the other person  We looked at overall engagement. We looked at their desire to cooperate. And this is what we see when they use just the screen. It turns out  when you add mobility    the ability to roll around the table    you get a little more of a boost. And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression. So it seems like this physical  social embodiment actually really makes a difference. Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. Today we know that families are living further and further apart  and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. For me  I have three young boys  and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents. But my parents live thousands of miles away  so they just don't get to see each other that often. We try Skype  we try phone calls  but my boys are little    they don't really want to talk  they want to play. So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance play technology. I imagine a time not too far from now    my mom can go to her computer  open up a browser and jack into a little robot. And as grandma bot  she can now play  really play  with my sons  with her grandsons  in the real world with his real toys. I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social plays with their granddaughters  with their friends  and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house  like sharing a bedtime story. And through this technology  being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today. Let's think about some other domains  like maybe health. So in the United States today  over    percent of people are either overweight or obese  and now it's a big problem with our children as well. And we know that as you get older in life  if you're obese when you're younger  that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life  but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system. But if robots can be engaging  if we like to cooperate with robots  if robots are persuasive  maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program  maybe they can help you manage your weight. Sort of like a digital Jiminy    as in the well known fairy tale    a kind of friendly  supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. So we actually explored this idea in our lab. This is a robot  Autom. Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. And it was designed to be a robot diet and exercise coach. It had a couple of simple non verbal skills it could do. It could make eye contact with you. It could share information looking down at a screen. You'd use a screen interface to enter information  like how many calories you ate that day  how much exercise you got. And then it could help track that for you. And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth. And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. It could help you set goals and track your progress  and it would help motivate you. So an interesting question is  does the social embodiment really matter  Does it matter that it's a robot  Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters  To explore that question  we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks. One case was the robot you saw there  Autom. Another was a computer that ran the same touch screen interface  ran exactly the same dialogues. The quality of advice was identical. And the third was just a pen and paper log  because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet and exercise program. So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost  but really how long they interacted with the robot. Because the challenge is not losing weight  it's actually keeping it off. And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions  well that's indicative  potentially  of longer term success. So the first thing I want to look at is how long  how long did people interact with these systems. It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more  even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance  people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. And when you look at emotional engagement  it was completely different. People would name the robots. They would dress the robots. And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study  they would come out to the car and say good bye to the robots. They didn't do this with a computer. The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today  whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. My sons  they love the screen. They love the screen. But I want them to play  as a mom  I want them to play  like  real world play. And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child  where it can take on many of the properties of real world play. So here's the first exploration of this idea  where characters can be physical or virtual  and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended reality play. But we can push this idea further. What if    CB     the character itself could come into your world  It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world. And when it's in their world  they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities. So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world. So here  Nathan has changed the letter A to the number  . You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world. So they are now sending the character back into that world. And now it's got number power. And then finally  what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids  where they really feel like they are part of that story  a part of that experience. And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching  Star Wars.  But I want to do more than that. I actually want them to create those experiences. I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them. I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. I think that's very  very important. So this is a new project. We've invited a lot of kids into this space  and they think it's pretty cool. But I can tell you  the thing that they love the most is the robot. What they care about is the robot. Robots touch something deeply human within us. And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative  or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance  or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves  for me  robots are all about people. Thank you. Hawa Abdi  Many people       years for Somalia     were  fighting. So there was no job  no food. Children  most of them  became very malnourished  like this. Deqo Mohamed  So as you know  always in a civil war  the ones affected most  are  the women and children. So our patients are women and children. And they are in our backyard. It's our home. We welcome them. That's the camp that we have in now        people  where    percent of them are women and children. Pat Mitchell  And this is your hospital. This is the inside. HA  We are doing C sections and different operations because people need some help. There is no government to protect them. DM  Every morning we have about     patients  maybe more or less. But sometimes we are only five doctors and    nurses  and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them. But we take the severe ones  and we reschedule the other ones the next day. It is very tough. And as you can see  it's the women who are carrying the children  it's the women who come into the hospitals  it's the women  are  building the houses. That's their house. And we have a school. This is our bright    we opened  in the  last two years  an  elementary school where we have     children  and the majority are women and girls. PM  And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. Would you explain the rules for admission  HA  The people who are coming to us  we are welcoming. We are sharing with them whatever we have. But there are only two rules. First rule  there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society.  Whomever  makes those things we throw out. The second  no man can beat his wife. If he beat  we will put  him  in jail  and we will call the eldest people. Until they identify this case  we'll never release him. That's our two rules. The other thing that I have realized  that the woman is the most strong person all over the world. Because the last    years  the Somali woman has stood up. They were the leaders  and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations. We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. We can reconcile. We can do everything. DM  As my mother said  we are the future hope  and the men are only killing in Somalia. So we came up with these two rules. In a camp with        people  you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. So there is no clan division  and no man can beat his wife. And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail. So if you beat your wife  you're going to be there. So empowering the women and giving the opportunity    we are there for them. They are not alone for this. PM  You're running a medical clinic. It brought much  much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it. You're also running a civil society. You've created your own rules  in which women and children are getting a different sense of security. Talk to me about your decision  Dr. Abdi  and your decision  Dr. Mohamed  to work together    for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances. HA  My age    because I was born in         we were having  at that time  government  law and order. But one day  I went to the hospital    my mother was sick    and I saw the hospital  how they  were  treating the doctors  how they  are  committed to help the sick people. I admired them  and I decided to become a doctor. My mother died  unfortunately  when I was    years  old . Then my father allowed me to proceed  with  my hope. My mother died in  a  gynecology complication  so I decided to become a gynecology specialist. That's why I became a doctor. So Dr. Deqo has to explain. DM  For me  my mother was preparing  me  when I was a child to become a doctor  but I really didn't want to. Maybe I should become an historian  or maybe a reporter. I loved it  but it didn't work. When the war broke out    civil war    I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help  and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children. And I thought  maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist. So I went to Russia  and my mother also   during the  time of  the  Soviet Union. So some of our character  maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. So that's how I decided  to do  the same. My sister was different. She's here. She's also a doctor. She graduated in Russia also. And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war    when I was     and my sister was     when the civil war broke out. So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '  s    that's what made us go back and work for them. PM  So what is the biggest challenge working  mother and daughter  in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations  HA  Yes  I was working in a tough situation  very dangerous. And when I saw the people who needed me  I was staying with them to help  because I  could  do something for them. Most people fled abroad. But I remained with those people  and I was trying to do something     any  little thing I  could  do. I succeeded in my place. Now my place is        people who are respecting each other  who are not fighting. But we try to stand on our feet  to do something  little things  we can for our people. And I'm thankful for my daughters. When they come to me  they help me to treat the people  to help. They do everything for them. They have done what I desire to do for them. PM  What's the best part of working with your mother  and the most challenging part for you  DM  She's very tough  it's most challenging. She always expects us to do more. And really when you think  you  cannot do it  she will push you  and I can do it. That's the best part. She shows us  trains us how to do and how to be better  people  and how to do long hours in surgery        patients per day         surgeries  and still you have to manage the camp    that's how she trains us. It is not like beautiful offices here     patients  you're tired. You see     patients     surgeries and        people to manage. PM  But you do it for good reasons. Wait. Wait. HA  Thank you. DM  Thank you. HA  Thank you very much. DM  Thank you very much. I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples. These are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider. They produce six different types of silk  which is spun together into a fiber  tougher than any fiber humans have ever made. The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber. And to make that  it involves extremes of temperature  extremes of pressure and loads of pollution. And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn. This beetle can detect a forest fire at    kilometers away. That's roughly        times the range of man made fire detectors. And what's more  this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels. So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver. If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does  we could achieve factor     factor      maybe even factor       savings in resource and energy use. And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution  I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about. Firstly  radical increases in resource efficiency. Secondly  shifting from a linear  wasteful  polluting way of using resources to a closed loop model. And thirdly  changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy. And for all three of these  I believe  biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need. You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products  and all of those have benefited from a  .  billion year research and development period. And given that level of investment  it makes sense to use it. So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas. And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency. When we were working on the Eden Project  we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular  but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried. It was a hell of a challenge  and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. So for instance  it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels. Studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons. The next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons. And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass  which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes. And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes. So we started exploring this material called ETFE. It's a high strength polymer. And what you do is you put it together in three layers  you weld it around the edge  and then you inflate it. And the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass  and it was only one percent of the weight of double glazing. So that was a factor     saving. And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. So with such large  lightweight pillows  we had much less steel. With less steel we were getting more sunlight in  which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter. And with less overall weight in the superstructure  there were big savings in the foundations. And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency    delivering the same function  but with a fraction of the resource input. And actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions. So for instance  you could develop super efficient roof structures based on giant Amazon water lilies  whole buildings inspired by abalone shells  super lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells. There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool. So now I want to go onto talking about the linear to closed loop idea. The way we tend to use resources is we extract them  we turn them into short life products and then dispose of them. Nature works very differently. In ecosystems  the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system. And there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems. And one of my favorites is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project by Graham Wiles. And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food  cardboard and plastic waste. It was ending up in landfills. Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste. And I'm just going to talk through this animation. So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants. They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding. When that was soiled  they were paid again to collect it. They put it into worm recomposting systems  which produced a lot of worms  which they fed to Siberian sturgeon  which produced caviar  which they sold back to the restaurants. So it transformed a linear process into a closed loop model  and it created more value in the process. Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this  turning waste streams into schemes that create value. And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time  there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. And I know it's a quirky example  but I think the implications of this are quite radical  because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem    waste    into a massive opportunity. And particularly in cities    we could look at the whole metabolism of cities  and look at those as opportunities. And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about  the Mobius Project  where we're trying to bring together a number of activities  all within one building  so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another. And the kind of elements I'm talking about are  firstly  we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse  a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas. Then we would have an anaerobic digester  which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area  turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid. We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater  turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro organisms. We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant. And we'd also have a coffee shop  and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms. So you can see that we're bringing together cycles of food  energy and water and waste all within one building. And just for fun  we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London  which at the moment is a complete eyesore. Some of you may recognize this. And with just a little bit of planning  we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people  reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities. So the final project I want to talk about is the Sahara Forest Project  which we're working on at the moment. It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago. So for instance  when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa  huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests. And during the evolution of life on the Earth  it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy. The converse is also true. The more vegetation we lose  the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification. And this animation  this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years  and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot  and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt  or maybe even reverse  desertification. And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts  there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. This is the Namibian fog basking beetle  and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert. The way it does this is it comes out at night  crawls to the top of a sand dune  and because it's got a matte black shell  is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings. So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea  you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell. Just before sunrise  he tips his shell up  the water runs down into his mouth  has a good drink  goes off and hides for the rest of the day. And the ingenuity  if you could call it that  goes even further. Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell  there are lots of little bumps on that shell. And those bumps are hydrophilic  they attract water. Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water. And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps  they stay in tight  spherical beads  which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell. So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air  it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth. So amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource constrained environment    and in that sense  very relevant to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing over the next few years  next few decades. We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse. This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions  and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills  and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through  it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process. So inside it's cool and humid  which means the plants need less water to grow. And then at the back of the greenhouse  it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle. And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. So they just started spreading this on the land around  and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. This photograph was taken on completion day  and just one year later  it looked like that. So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land    and in that sense  going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design. So we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits. And when you think about nature  often you think about it as being all about competition. But actually in mature ecosystems  you're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships. So an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters. And the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse is concentrated solar power  which uses solar tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat to create electricity. And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP  consider that we receive        times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms           times. So our energy problems are not intractable. It's a challenge to our ingenuity. And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are  firstly  both these technologies work very well in hot  sunny deserts. CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater. That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces. CSP produces a lot of waste heat. We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits. And finally  in the shade under the mirrors  it's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight. So this is how this scheme would look. The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind. We'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way. Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts. And with biomimicry  if you've got an underutilized resource  you don't think   How am I going to dispose of this   You think   What can I add to the system to create more value   And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages. When you evaporate seawater  the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. And that builds up on the evaporators    and that's what that image on the left is    gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate. So after a while  we could take that out  use it as a lightweight building block. And if you think about the carbon in that  that would have come out of the atmosphere  into the sea and then locked away in a building product. The next thing is sodium chloride. You can also compress that into a building block  as they did here. This is a hotel in Bolivia. And then after that  there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract  like phosphates  that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them. And there's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater. So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high performance batteries. And in parts of the Arabian Gulf  the seawater  the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse. Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine. We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts  transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity. Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero carbon food  abundant renewable energy in some of the most water stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning  radical increases in resource efficiency  closing loops and a solar economy. They're not just possible  they're critical. And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions. But perhaps more than anything  what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design. Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language. But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing. And this is an important point. Antoine de Saint Exupery once said   If you want to build a flotilla of ships  you don't sit around talking about carpentry. No  you need to set people's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores.  And that's what we need to do  so let's be positive  and let's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby  curly haired guy from Holland    why is he whistling  Well actually  I've  been  whistling since the age of four  about four. My dad was always whistling around the house  and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually  till I was     I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling  because  to be honest  my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. I whistled on  my  bike. I whistled everywhere. And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family in law. And they had some  in my opinion  terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like  I try to make it better. So  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer     you know it  But it can also sound like this. But during a Christmas party    at dinner actually    it's very annoying. So my sister in law asked me a few times   Please stop whistling.  And I just couldn't. And at one point    and I had some wine  I have to admit that    at one point I said   If there was a contest  I would join.  And two weeks later I received a text message   You're going to America.  So  okay  I'm going to America. I would love to  but why  So I immediately called her up  of course. She Googled  and she found this World Whistling Championship in America  of course. She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. I lost my face. And she thought   He will never go there.  But actually I did. So I went to Louisburg  North Carolina  southeast United States  and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the world championship  and I won there in     . That was great fun  of course. And to defend my title    like judokas do and sportsmen    I thought  well let's go back in       and I won again. Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in      I entered again in Japan  Tokyo  and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam  in the beautiful city  on a big stage  and I'm talking about whistling. And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse. And I try to live my dream    well  actually  it was never my dream  but it sounds so good. Okay  I'm not the only one whistling here. You say   Huh  what do you mean   Well actually  you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens  people are watching each other and think   Oh  my God. Why  Can I go away   No  you can't. Actually it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called  F te de la Belle.  It's about    minutes long. No  no  no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. So I whistle the tone. Sorry. I forgot one thing. You whistle the same tone as me. I heard a wide variety of tones. This is very promising. This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started  I just point where you whistle along  and we will see what happens. Oh  hah. I'm so sorry  technicians. I'm so used to that. I start it myself. Okay  here it is. Okay. It's easy  isn't it  Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself. Max Westerman  Geert Chatrou  the World Champion  of  Whistling. Geert Chatrou  Thank you. Thank you. We're here to celebrate compassion. But compassion  from my vantage point  has a problem. As essential as it is across our traditions  as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives  the word  compassion  is hollowed out in our culture  and it is suspect in my field of journalism. It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing  or it's seen as potentially depressing. Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and  after the fact  the word  compassion  was translated as  pity.  Now compassion  when it enters the news  too often comes in the form of feel good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter  that they shape the way we understand ourselves  the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others. When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the     s  we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. Now the word  tolerance   if you look at it in the dictionary  connotes  allowing    indulging  and  enduring.  In the medical context that it comes from  it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment. Tolerance is not really a lived virtue  it's more of a cerebral ascent. And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. And the going is pretty rough right now. I think that without perhaps being able to name it  we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue. Compassion is a worthy successor. It is organic  across our religious  spiritual and ethical traditions  and yet it transcends them. Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others  both in our private and in our civic spaces. So what is it  three dimensionally  What are its kindred and component parts  What's in its universe of attendant virtues  To start simply  I want to say that compassion is kind. Now  kindness  might sound like a very mild word  and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification. Compassion is also curious. Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles  Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi. They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims  and as they do that  they cultivate what they call  curiosity without assumptions.  Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation  but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there  just showing up. I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty    and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other  not just what it is about them that might need helping. I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. And in that light  for the religious  compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery    encouraging us not just to see beauty  but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering  in the face of a stranger  in the face of the vibrant religious other. I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like  but I can show you what compassion looks like    because it is visible. When we see it  we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable  what is possible. It is so important when we're communicating big ideas    but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion    to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood    the color and complexity of life. And compassion does seek physicality. I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford. And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him  but he's paraplegic. He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was     in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. Matthew's legs don't work  and he'll never walk again  and    and he does experience this as an  and  rather than a  but     and he experiences himself to be healed and whole. And as a teacher of yoga  he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability  health  illness and aging. He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. I can't quite explain it  and he can't either. But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body  in all its frailty and its grace  without  at the same time  becoming more compassionate towards all of life. Compassion also looks like this. This is Jean Vanier. Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities  which you can now find all over the world  communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities    mostly Down syndrome. The communities that Jean Vanier founded  like Jean Vanier himself  exude tenderness.  Tender  is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting. We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive  and I spend a lot of time being those things too. And compassion can also have those qualities. But again and again  lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness. Jean Vanier says that his work  like the work of other people    his great  beloved  late friend Mother Teresa    is never in the first instance about changing the world  it's in the first instance about changing ourselves. He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution  but a sign. Compassion is rarely a solution  but it is always a sign of a deeper reality  of deeper human possibilities. And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories  never by statistics and strategies. We need those things too  but we're also bumping up against their limits. And at the same time that we are doing that  I think we are rediscovering the power of story    that as human beings  we need stories to survive  to flourish  to change. Our traditions have always known this  and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us. There is  of course  a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world    tikkun olam. And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen  who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her  that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. And that the highest human calling is to look for this light  to point at it when we see it  to gather it up  and in so doing  to repair the world. Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way. Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time  because this story insists that each and every one of us  frail and flawed as we may be  inadequate as we may feel  has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch. Stories like this  signs like this  are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing  how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine    the work Fred Luskin is doing    I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the   st century    that science  in fact  is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism. This is going to change science  I believe  and it will change religion. But here's a face from   th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion. We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E   mc . We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer  Marian Anderson  to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South. Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions. But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early   th century. He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three year old. And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced  we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more  not less. He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages. Some of his favorites were Moses  Jesus  Buddha  St. Francis of Assisi  Gandhi    he adored his contemporary  Gandhi. And Einstein said    and I think this is a quote  again  that has not been passed down in his legacy    that  these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living  more necessary to the dignity  security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge.  Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us  but actually it is. I want to show you the rest of this photograph  because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word  compassion  in our culture    we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life  which is messy. So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral    it's not. This is the full photograph  and you see a middle aged man wearing a leather jacket  smoking a cigar. And by the look of that paunch  he hasn't been doing enough yoga. We put these two photographs side by side on our website  and someone said   When I look at the first photo  I ask myself  what was he thinking  And when I look at the second  I ask  what kind of person was he  What kind of man is this   Well  he was complicated. He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. And it is much harder  often  to be compassionate towards those closest to us  which is another quality in the universe of compassion  on its dark side  that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. Gandhi  too  was a real flawed human being. So was Martin Luther King  Jr. So was Dorothy Day. So was Mother Teresa. So are we all. And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion    following on what Fred Luskin says    that these flaws just make us human. Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems  in fact  are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion  towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life long struggle with Crohn's disease. Einstein became a humanitarian  not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter  but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. And Karen Armstrong  I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that  with a zigzag  have led to the Charter for Compassion. Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity. So I want to propose a final definition of compassion    this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way    and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this  and we need them to mine it for us now. But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious. So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity  the future of humanity  needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race. Thank you. I want you to take a look at this baby. What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see    what's going on up in that little brain of hers. The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science. And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the  celestial openness  of the child's mind. What we see here is a mother in India  and she's speaking Koro  which is a newly discovered language. And she's talking to her baby. What this mother    and the     people who speak Koro in the world    understands  is  that  to preserve this language  they need to speak it to the babies. And therein lies a critical puzzle. Why is it that you can't preserve a language by speaking to you and I  to the adults  Well  it's got to do with your brain. What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning. The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis. And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language. Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven  and then there's a systematic decline. After puberty  we fall off the map. No scientists dispute this curve  but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way. Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development    and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. We think  by studying how the sounds are learned  we'll have a model for the rest of language  and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social  emotional and cognitive development. So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages. The baby sits on a parent's lap  and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes    like from  ah  to  ee.  If they do so at the appropriate time  the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum. A six monther adores the task. What have we learned  Well  babies all over the world are what I like to describe as  citizens of the world.  They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages  no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using  and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that. We're culture bound listeners. We can discriminate the sounds of our own language  but not those of foreign languages. So the question arises  when do those citizens of the world turn into the language bound listeners that we are  And the answer  before their first birthdays. What you see here is performance on that head turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States  here in Seattle  as they listened to  ra  and  la     sounds important to English  but not to Japanese. So at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent. Two months later something incredible occurs. The babies in the United States are getting a lot better  babies in Japan are getting a lot worse  but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn. So the question is  what's happening during this critical two month period  This is the critical period for sound development  but what's going on up there  So there are two things going on. The first is that the babies are listening intently to us  and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk    they're taking statistics. So listen to two mothers speaking motherese    the universal language we use when we talk to kids    first in English and then in Japanese. so pretty and nice. Japanese Mother   Japanese  Patricia Kuhl  During the production of speech  when babies listen  what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. And those distributions grow. And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics  and the statistics of Japanese and English are very  very different. English has a lot of Rs and Ls. The distribution shows. And the distribution of Japanese is totally different  where we see a group of intermediate sounds  which is known as the Japanese  R.  So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains  it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture bound listeners that we are. But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics. We're governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development. So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize. It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people. Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them  one after the other  depending on who they're speaking to. So we asked ourselves  can the babies take statistics on a brand new language  And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. We knew that  when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds  they showed the same pattern. Six to eight months  they're totally equivalent. Two months later  something incredible happens. But the Taiwanese babies are getting better  not the American babies. What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin. It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for    sessions. Here's what it looked like in the laboratory. PK  So what have we done to their little brains  We had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills. So a group of babies came in and listened to English. And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin. But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for    sessions. They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for    and a half months. What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. Whatever you put in front of them  they'll take statistics on. But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise. So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage  the same    sessions  but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. What did we do to their brains  What you see here is the audio result    no learning whatsoever    and the video result    no learning whatsoever. It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics. The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics. We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions  as opposed to in front of human beings. Thankfully  we have a new machine  magnetoencephalography  that allows us to do this. It looks like a hair dryer from Mars. But it's completely safe  completely non invasive and silent. We're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using     SQUIDs    these are Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices    to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking. We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning. So this is little Emma. She's a six monther. And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. You can see  she can move around. We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap  so she's free to move completely unconstrained. It's a technical tour de force. What are we seeing  We're seeing the baby brain. As the baby hears a word in her language the auditory areas light up  and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence  getting the brain coordinated with its different areas  and causality  one brain area causing another to activate. We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child's brain development. We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion  as they learn to speak and read  as they solve a math problem  as they have an idea. And we're going to be able to invent brain based interventions for children who have difficulty learning. Just as the poets and writers described  we're going to be able to see  I think  that wondrous openness  utter and complete openness  of the mind of a child. In investigating the child's brain  we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human  and in the process  we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives. Thank you. I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days  talking to groups of students and professionals  and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes. On the one hand  people say   The time for change is now.  They want to be part of it. They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning. But on the other hand  I hear people talking about fear  a sense of risk aversion. They say   I really want to follow a life of purpose  but I don't know where to start. I don't want to disappoint my family or friends.  I work in global poverty. And they say   I want to work in global poverty  but what will it mean about my career  Will I be marginalized  Will I not make enough money  Will I never get married or have children   And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older    and I'm glad I waited       and has no children  I look at these young people and I say   Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is only to be human. And nothing important happens in life without a cost.  These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level. Our leaders and ourselves want everything  but we don't talk about the costs. We don't talk about the sacrifice. One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen  the great American writer from the South. In a short story called  Oh Yes   she talks about a white woman in the     s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl  and she looks at her child with a sense of pride  but she also wonders  what price will she pay   Better immersion than to live untouched.  But the real question is  what is the cost of not daring  What is the cost of not trying  I've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion. One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. She was a leader of the Menominee tribe  a Native American peoples. And when we would gather as fellows  she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions. And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future  looking at them from the Earth  and they would look at them  holding them as stewards for that future. Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other  not only as human beings  but to every living thing on the planet. And tragically  in       when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people  focused on preserving their culture and language  she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC. And whenever we would gather the fellows after that  we would leave a chair empty for her spirit. And more than a decade later  when I talk to NGO fellows  whether in Trenton  New Jersey or the office of the White House  and we talk about Ingrid  they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission. And when we think about legacy  I can think of no more powerful one  despite how short her life was. And I've been touched by Cambodian women    beautiful women  women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia. And I met them in the early '  s. In the     s  under the Pol Pot regime  the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people  and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals  the artists  the dancers. And at the end of the war  there were only    of these classical dancers still living. And the women  who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors  told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps. They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance  hoping that others were alive and doing the same. And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage  her hands at her side  and she talked about the reunion of the    after the war and how extraordinary it was. And these big tears fell down her face  but she never lifted her hands to move them. And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls  because they had grown too old already  but the next generation. And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands    beautiful rhythms    as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them  wearing these beautiful silk colors. And I thought  after all this atrocity  this is how human beings really pray. Because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future. And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure. I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership. And I have learned that power  particularly in its absolute form  is an equal opportunity provider. In       I moved to Rwanda  and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank. And one of the women was Agnes    there on your extreme left    she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda  and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda. We built this institution based on social justice  gender equity  this idea of empowering women. But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end. And though she had been part of building a liberal party  a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance  about three months before the genocide  she switched parties and joined the extremist party  Hutu Power  and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide. And I would visit her in the prisons  sitting side by side  knees touching  and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us  but that maybe it's not monsters so much  but the broken parts of ourselves  sadnesses  secret shame  and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts  those fragments  if you will  and to make us look at other beings  human beings  as lesser than ourselves    and in the extreme  to do terrible things. And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men. I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male. And so in a gathering where we're focused on women  while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them  we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered  unable to provide. And that  when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job  no education  no possibility  well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun. Sometimes very small investments can release enormous  infinite potential that exists in all of us. One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization  Suraj Sudhakar  has what we call moral imagination    the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. And he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world  Kibera. And they're incredible guys. And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums  and they're reading many TED authors and liking it. And then they created a business plan competition. Then they decided that they would do TEDx's. And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men. Alex  in some ways  said it best. He said   We used to feel like nobodies  but now we feel like somebodies.  And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link. What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other. And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV  or at best  microfinance. And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare    the photojournalists and the creatives  the graffiti artists  the teachers and the entrepreneurs. And they're doing it. And my hat's off to you in Kibera. My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive. At Acumen Fund  we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital    money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity  but as full bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. We leave our money for    to    years  and when we get it back  we invest in other innovations that focus on change. I know it works. We've invested more than    million dollars in    companies  and those companies have brought another     million dollars into these forgotten markets. This year alone  they've delivered    million services like maternal health care and housing  emergency services  solar energy  so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems. Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions  easy categories  because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument. But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit. And ultimately  we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact  measuring what is most important to us. And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it  but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways. And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change. Last May I had this extraordinary    hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side by side    one based on violence and the other on transcendence. I happened to be in Lahore  Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers. And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim. And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives  but they did more  because they created more hatred  more rage  more fear and certainly despair. But less than    hours  I was    miles away from those mosques  visiting one of our Acumen investees  an incredible man  Jawad Aslam  who dares to live a life of immersion. Born and raised in Baltimore  he studied real estate  worked in commercial real estate  and after      decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference. For two years  he hardly made any money  a tiny stipend  but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui. And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital  but he continued to pay a price. He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes. It took almost two years just to register the land. But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action. Today        people live in     houses in this beautiful community. And there's schools and clinics and shops. But there's only one mosque. And so I asked Jawad   How do you guys navigate  This is a really diverse community. Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays   He said   Long story. It was hard  it was a difficult road  but ultimately the leaders of the community came together  realizing we only have each other. And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams  and those imams would take turns  they would rotate who would say Friday prayer. But the whole community  all the different sects  including Shi'a and Sunni  would sit together and pray.  We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds. We face huge issues as a world    the financial crisis  global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness. And every day we have a choice. We can take the easier road  the more cynical road  which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was  a fear of each other  distancing and blame. Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation  transcendence  compassion and love  but also accountability and justice. I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles  who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States. And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six year old girl named Ruby Bridges  the first child to desegregate schools in the South    in this case  New Orleans. And he said that every day this six year old  dressed in her beautiful dress  would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily  calling her a monster  threatening to poison her    distorted faces. And every day he would watch her  and it looked like she was talking to the people. And he would say   Ruby  what are you saying   And she'd say   I'm not talking.  And finally he said   Ruby  I see that you're talking. What are you saying   And she said   Dr. Coles  I am not talking  I'm praying.  And he said   Well  what are you praying   And she said   I'm praying  'Father  forgive them  for they know not what they are doing.'  At age six  this child was living a life of immersion  and her family paid a price for it. But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education. My final story is about a young  beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga  who was another Acumen Fund fellow  who hails from Uganda  a farming community. And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya  just     miles away. And he said to me at the end of his year   Jacqueline  it was so humbling  because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture. But especially when I was talking to the African women  I sometimes made these mistakes    it was so hard for me to learn how to listen.  And he said   So I conclude that  in many ways  leadership is like a panicle of rice. Because at the height of the season  at the height of its powers  it's beautiful  it's green  it nourishes the world  it reaches to the heavens.  And he said   But right before the harvest  it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came.  We need leaders. We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can  ourselves  extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man  woman and child on this planet. And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone. Robert Kennedy once said that  few of us have the greatness to bend history itself  but each of us can work to change a small portion of events.  And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written. Our lives are so short  and our time on this planet is so precious  and all we have is each other. So may each of you live lives of immersion. They won't necessarily be easy lives  but in the end  it is all that will sustain us. Thank you. I'm speaking to you about what I call the  mesh.  It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff  with the things in our lives. And it's starting to look at    not always and not for everything    but in certain moments of time  access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them. And so it's the pursuit of better things  easily shared. And we come from a long tradition of sharing. We've shared transportation. We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam. We've also shared other sorts of entertainment    sports arenas  public parks  concert halls  libraries  universities. All these things are share platforms  but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the  mother of all share platforms.  And as I think about the mesh and I think about  well  what's driving it  how come it's happening now  I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. One is the recession    that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value    so starting to align the value with the true cost. Secondly  population growth and density into cities. More people  smaller spaces  less stuff. Climate change  we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet. Also  there's been this recent distrust of big brands  global big brands  in a bunch of different industries  and that's created an opening. Research is showing here  in the States  and in Canada and Western Europe  that most of us are much more open to local companies  or brands that maybe we haven't heard of. Whereas before  we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted. And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before    except for if you're sitting next to someone. The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades  and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance. It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way. It's also    Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems  and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance. It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways. And so for me  a mesh company  the  classic  mesh company  brings together these three things  our ability to connect to each other    most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS enabled and Web enabled    allows us to find each other and find things in time and space. And third is that physical things are readable on a map    so restaurants  a variety of venues  but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that  we can also track things that are moving  like a car  a taxicab  a transit system  a box that's moving through time and space. And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them. For example  I want to use Zipcar. How many people here have experienced car sharing or bike sharing  Wow  that's great. Okay  thank you. Basically Zipcar is the largest car sharing company in the world. They did not invent car sharing. Car sharing was actually invented in Europe. One of the founders went to Switzerland  saw it implemented someplace  said   Wow  that looks really cool. I think we can do that in Cambridge   brought it to Cambridge and they started    two women    Robin Chase being the other person who started it. Zipcar got some really important things right. First  they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir. And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car sharing. They made it sexy. They made it fresh. They made it aspirational. If you were a member of the club  when you're a member of a club  you're a Zipster. The cars they picked didn't look like ex cop cars that were hollowed out or something. They picked these sexy cars. They targeted to universities. They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching. It was a very nice experience  and the cars were clean and reliable  and it all worked. And so from a branding perspective  they got a lot right. But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company. They understand that they are an information company. Because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once  we have an interaction  and we're chow    usually as quickly as possible. But when you're sharing a car and you have a car share service  you might use an E.V. to commute  you get a truck because you're doing a home project. When you pick your aunt up at the airport  you get a sedan. And you're going to the mountains to ski  you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing. Meanwhile  these guys are sitting back  collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service. And so it's not only an option for them  but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us  to be like a concierge service. Because we give them so much information  and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving. They're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next. And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car  What percentage of the time  Any guesses  Those are really very good. I was imagining it was like    percent when I first started. The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent. And so basically even if you think it's    percent     percent of the time  something that costs us a lot of money    personally  and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things       percent of the time it's sitting around. So for this reason  I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that  if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away  there's a lot of value in those things. What set up with Zipcar    Zipcar started in     . In the last year        two car companies started  one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar  and the other one  RelayRides  in the U.S. They're both peer to peer car sharing services  because the two things that really work for car sharing is  one  the car has to be available  and two  it's within one or two blocks of where you stand. Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car  and it's probably also available. So people have created this business. Zipcar started a decade earlier  in     . It took them six years to get       cars in service. WhipCar  which started April of last year  it took them six months to get       cars in the service. So  really interesting. People are making anywhere between     and     dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it. So it's like vacation rentals for cars. Since I'm here    and I hope some people in the audience are in the car business       I'm thinking that  coming from the technology side of things    we saw cable ready TVs and WiFi ready Notebooks    it would be really great if  any minute now  you guys could start rolling share ready cars off. Because it just creates more flexibility. It allows us as owners to have other options. And I think we're going there anyway. The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses    and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses  or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies  car manufacturers  who are beginning to offer their own car share services as well as a second flanker brand  or as really a test  I think    is to make sharing irresistible. We have experiences in our lives  certainly  when sharing has been irresistible. It's just  how do we make that recurrent and scale it  We know also  because we're connected in social networks  that it's easy to create delight in one little place. It's contagious because we're all connected to each other. So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it  or I tell five people standing next to me  news travels. The opposite  as we know  is also true  often more true. So here we have LudoTruck  which is in L.A.  doing the things that gourmet food trucks do  and they've gathered quite a following. In general  and maybe  again  it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur  I look at things as platforms. Platforms are invitations. So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network  there are all these networks    Facebook as well. These platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience. And honestly  it's full of surprises. Because I don't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook  around Facebook  for example  two years ago  when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform. So in this way  I think that cities are platforms  and certainly Detroit is a platform. The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs    it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive. It's inviting participation  and cities have  historically  invited all sorts of participation. Now we're saying that there's other options as well. So  for example  city departments can open up transit data. Google has made available transit data API. And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S. that have provided the transit data  and different developers are building applications. So I was having a coffee in Portland  and half of a latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in    minutes. And so it's reliable  real data that's right in my face  where I am  so I can finish the latte. There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now  about    percent of vacant commercial and industrial space. That space is not vital. The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement. There's this thing    how many people here have heard of pop up stores or pop up shops  Oh  great. So I'm a big fan of this. And this is a very mesh y thing. Essentially  there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland  near where I live. There's a pop up general store every three weeks  and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies. Super fun  and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood. Subsequent to that  after it's been going for about a year now  they actually started to lease and create and extend. An area that was edgy artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people. So this is an example. The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts  and she does these pop up crafts fairs around London. But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments. From my perspective  one of the things pop up stores do is create perishability and urgency. It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson  sold out. And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing. So a lot of what we see in the mesh  and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define  refine and scale. It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur  to go to market  to be in conversation with people  listen  refine something and go back. It's very cost effective  and it's very mesh y. The infrastructure enables that. In closing  and as we're moving towards the end  I just also want to encourage    and I'm willing to share my failures as well  though not from the stage. I would just like to say that one of the big things  when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other  but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation  is by sharing failures. And one quick example is Velib  in       came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition  a very big bike sharing service. They made a lot of mistakes. They had some number of big successes. But they were very transparent  or they had to be  in the way that they exposed what worked and didn't work. And so B.C. in Barcelona and B cycle and Boris Bikes in London    no one has had to repeat the version  .  screw ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris. So the opportunity when we're connected is also to share failures and successes. We're at the very beginning of something that  what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward  is inviting  it's engaging  but it's very early. I have a website    it's a directory    and it started with about       companies  and in the last two and a half months it's up to about       companies. And it grows on a very regular daily basis. But it's very much at the beginning. So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride. And thank you very much. Pat Mitchell  What is the story of this pin  Madeleine Albright  This is  Breaking the Glass Ceiling.  PM  Oh. That was well chosen  I would say  for TEDWomen. MA  Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen. And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein. I'll tell you what happened. I went to the United Nations as an ambassador  and it was after the Gulf War  and I was an instructed ambassador. And the cease fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions  and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly  which he deserved    he had invaded another country. And so all of a sudden  a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things  but among them an  unparalleled serpent.  And so I happened to have a snake pin. So I wore it when we talked about Iraq. And when I went out to meet the press  they zeroed in  said   Why are you wearing that snake pin   I said   Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent.  And then I thought  well this is fun. So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would  in fact  reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day. So that's how it all started. PM  So how large is the collection  MA  Pretty big. It's now traveling. At the moment it's in Indianapolis  but it was at the Smithsonian. And it goes with a book that says   Read My Pins.  PM  So is this a good idea. I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State  and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing  how you looked    the thing that happens to a lot of women  especially if they're the first in a position. So how do you feel about that    the whole    MA  Well  it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. But people did pay attention to what clothes I had. What was interesting was that  before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador  I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick  who'd been ambassador before me  and she said   You've got to get rid of your professor clothes. Go out and look like a diplomat.  So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping. But still  there were all kinds of questions about     did you wear a hat    How short was your skirt   And one of the things    if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots  and she got criticized over that. And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it. PM  It is  for all of us  men and women  finding our ways of defining our roles  and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother  a grandmother  nurturing ... and so how did you handle that  MA  Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. And I said   Well I've been a woman for    years  but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.  So it evolved. But basically I love being a woman. And so what happened    and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this    I went to my first meeting  first at the U.N.  and that's when this all started  because that is a very male organization. And I'm sitting there    there are    members of the Security Council    so    men sat there staring at me  and I thought    well you know how we all are. You want to get the feeling of the room  and  do people like me   and  will I really say something intelligent   And all of a sudden I thought   Well  wait a minute. I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States ' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard   and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal  reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country. And so that happened more at various times  but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman. I think we are a lot better at personal relationships  and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary. But I have to tell you  I have my youngest granddaughter  when she turned seven last year  said to her mother  my daughter   So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State  Only girls are Secretary of State.  PM  Because in her lifetime    MA  That would be so. PM  What a change that is. As you travel now all over the world  which you do frequently  how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls  Where are we  MA  I think we're slowly changing  but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different. And therefore it means that we have to remember that  while many of us have had huge opportunities    and Pat  you have been a real leader in your field    is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women. And so what I have felt    and I have looked at this from a national security issue    when I was Secretary of State  I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy  not just because I'm a feminist  but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered  that values are passed down  the health situation is better  education is better  there is greater economic prosperity. So I think that it behooves us    those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice    that we need to help other women. And I really dedicated myself to that  both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State. PM  And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy  MA  From some people. I think that they thought that it was a soft issue. The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues  because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects  and because  as I said  it is really central to the way that we think about things. Now for instance  some of the wars that took place when I was in office  a lot of them  the women were the main victims of it. For instance  when I started  there were wars in the Balkans. The women in Bosnia were being raped. We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues. And by the way  one of the things that I did at that stage was  I had just arrived at the U.N.  and when I was there  there were     countries in the U.N. Now there are    . But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. So I said to my assistant   Invite the other women permanent representatives.  And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there. I get there  and there are six other women  out of    . So the countries that had women representatives were Canada  Kazakhstan  Philippines  Trinidad Tobago  Jamaica  Lichtenstein and me. So being an American  I decided to set up a caucus. And so we set it up  and we called ourselves the G . PM  Is that  Girl     MA  Girl  . And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues. So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal. And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war  that it was against humanity. PM  So when you look around the world and you see that  in many cases    certainly in the Western world    women are evolving into more leadership positions  and even other places some barriers are being brought down  but there's still so much violence  still so many problems  and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables. Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't  when there was maybe you    one voice  maybe one or two others. Do you believe  and can you tell us why  there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis  MA  Well I do think  when there are more women  that the tone of the conversation changes  and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that  you've forgotten high school. But the bottom line is that there is a way  when there are more women at the table  that there's an attempt to develop some understanding. So for instance  what I did when I went to Burundi  we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda. And so I think the capability of women to put themselves    I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy. I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room. When I was Secretary of State  there were only    other women foreign ministers. And so it was nice when one of them would show up. For instance  she is now the president of Finland  but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and  at a certain stage  head of the European Union. And it was really terrific. Because one of the things I think you'll understand. We went to a meeting  and the men in my delegation  when I would say   Well I feel we should do something about this   and they'd say   What do you mean  you feel   And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me. And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control  and she said   Well I feel we should do this.  And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions. The other thing that I think is really important  A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy  but it's about budgets  military budgets  and how the debts of countries work out. So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts  they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries. PM  So how do we get this balance we're looking for  then  in the world  More women's voices at the table  More men who believe that the balance is best  MA  Well I think one of the things    I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates. I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office  to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices. I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other. Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about  because I am of a certain age where  when I started in my career  believe it or not  there were other women who criticized me   Why aren't you in the carpool line   or  Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time   And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. In fact  I think  guilt  is every woman's middle name. And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other. PM  Well Secretary Albright  I guess you'll be going to heaven. Thank you for joining us today. MA  Thank you all. Thanks Pat. It's Monday morning. In Washington  the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office  assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen. At Number    Downing Street  David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double dip recession. In Madrid  Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door  listening to her baby crying and crying  trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it. And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital  trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one and a half liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said   You must make him drink today      my father's been nil by mouth for a week    or whether  by giving him this bottle  I might actually kill him. We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives  and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions. We talk things over with our friends  we scour the Internet  we search through books. But still  even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends  it's still experts that we rely upon most    especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters. Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity  we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can    that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own. And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing  we feel reassured by the almost parental like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do. But I believe that this is a big problem  a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society  as a culture and as individuals. It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world    of course they have. The problem lies with us  we've become addicted to experts. We've become addicted to their certainty  their assuredness  their definitiveness  and in the process  we have ceded our responsibility  substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom. We've surrendered our power  trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. This is no exaggeration. In a recent experiment  a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak. The results were quite extraordinary. As they listened to the experts' voices  the independent decision making parts of their brains switched off. It literally flat lined. And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice  however right or wrong. But experts do get things wrong. Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of     Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself  you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you  And then there's  of course  the example that we're all too aware of  financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the     s. For the sake of our health  our wealth and our collective security  it's imperative that we keep the independent decision making parts of our brains switched on. And I'm saying this as an economist who  over the past few years  has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why  but also    and I'm aware of the irony here    as an expert myself  as a professor  as somebody who advises prime ministers  heads of big companies  international organizations  but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change  that we need to become more open minded  more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view. So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from  let me bring you into my world  the world of experts. Now there are  of course  exceptions  wonderful  civilization enhancing exceptions. But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps  that within these camps  a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition  that experts move with the prevailing winds  often hero worshipping their own gurus. Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on  not challenged by his peers  until after the crisis  of course. You see  we also learn that experts are located  are governed  by the social and cultural norms of their times    whether it be the doctors in Victorian England  say  who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire  or the psychiatrists in the United States who  up until       were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness. And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift  that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks    because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects  or studies funded by food companies of their new products  massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market. The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study. And we've also got to be aware that experts  of course  also make mistakes. They make mistakes every single day    mistakes born out of carelessness. A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries  operating on the wrong side of the brain  carrying out procedures on the wrong hand  elbow  eye  foot  and also mistakes born out of thinking errors. A common thinking error of radiologists  for example    when they look at CT scans    is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia  say  what happens is that  if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan  they literally stop looking at it    thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs. I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts. These are  of course  not the only insights I could share  but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them  why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision making capabilities on. But how can we do this  Well for the sake of time  I want to focus on just three strategies. First  we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern day apostles. This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D. in every single subject  you'll be relieved to hear. But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when  for example  we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand. Why was it that  when I had an operation  my doctor said to me   Beware  Ms. Hertz  of hyperpyrexia   when he could have just as easily said   Watch out for a high fever.  You see  being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs  their equations  their forecasts  their prophecies  and being armed with the questions to do that    questions like  What are the assumptions that underpin this  What is the evidence upon which this is based  What has your investigation focused on  And what has it ignored  It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first  primarily on male animals and then  primarily on men. It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men    and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed. Second  we need to create the space for what I call  managed dissent.  If we are to shift paradigms  if we are to make breakthroughs  if we are to destroy myths  we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out  in which we're bringing in new  diverse  discordant  heretical views into the discussion  fearlessly  in the knowledge that progress comes about  not only from the creation of ideas  but also from their destruction    and also from the knowledge that  by surrounding ourselves by divergent  discordant  heretical views. All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter. Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts  which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true. And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent. Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy. In meetings  he looks out for the person in the room    arms crossed  looking a bit bemused    and draws them into the discussion  trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion  so that they have dissent within the room. Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement  discord and difference. But we need to go even further. We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees  fancy titles  diplomas  best selling books    high status individuals. But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise    whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's  but also shop girls    yeah. Best Buy  the consumer electronics company  gets all its employees    the cleaners  the shop assistants  the people in the back office  not just its forecasting team    to place bets  yes bets  on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas  on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company  on whether a project will come in on time. By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company  Best Buy was able to discover  for example  that the store that it was going to open in China    its big  grand store    was not going to open on time. Because when it asked its staff  all its staff  to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not  a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening. It turned out that they were aware  as no one else within the company was  of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts  nor the experts on the ground in China  were even aware of. The strategies that I have discussed this evening    embracing dissent  taking experts on  democratizing expertise  rebellious strategies    are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing  complex  difficult times. For if we keep our independent decision making part of our brains switched on  if we challenge experts  if we're skeptical  if we devolve authority  if we are rebellious  but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance  uncertainty and doubt  and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too  we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the   st century. For now  more than ever  is not the time to be blindly following  blindly accepting  blindly trusting. Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open    yes  using experts to help us figure things out  for sure    I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here    but being aware of their limitations and  of course  also our own. Thank you. Our face is hugely important because it's the external  visual part that everybody else sees. Let's not forget it's a functional entity. We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body  the brain. It's where our senses are located  our special senses    our vision  our speech  our hearing  our smell  our taste. And this bone is peppered  as you can see  with the light shining through the skull with cavities  the sinuses  which warm and moisten the air we breathe. But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone    our head would be dead weight  we wouldn't be able to hold it erect  we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us. This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat. Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression  our universal language of expression  our social signaling system. And overlying this is the skin drape  which is a hugely complex three dimensional structure    taking right angled bends here and there  having thin areas like the eyelids  thick areas like the cheek  different colors. And then we have the sensual factor of the face. Where do we like to kiss people  On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe. It's the face where we're attracted to with that. But let's not forget the hair. You're looking at the image on your left hand side    that's my son with his eyebrows present. Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing. There's a definite difference. And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose  he'd look even odder still. Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. It's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves  and we only see ourselves in freeze frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live. Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. They don't need this. They need psychiatric help. Max has kindly donated his photograph to me. He doesn't have dysmorphophobia  but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic. In other words  he looks entirely normal. Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes. So children judge themselves  learn to judge themselves  by the behavior of adults around them. Here's a classic example  Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull  has obliterated her nose  and she's having difficulty seeing. As you can see  it's blocking her vision. She's also in danger  when she damages this  of bleeding profusely. Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them. They've grown used to their face  they think they're special. Actually  sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them. But other adults say incredibly painful things. They say   How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people. Shouldn't you be doing something about this  Why haven't you had it removed   And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion  because    a natural curiosity. And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature. After surgery  everything normalizes. The adults behave more naturally  and the children play more readily with other children. As teenagers    just think back to your teenage years    we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance. We're trying to struggle to find our identity. We crave the approval of our peers. So our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world. Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days. How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day  practicing your sardonic look  practicing your serious look  trying to look like Sean Connery  as I did  trying to raise one eyebrow  It's a crippling time. I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward. I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward. Turn to the person next to you  push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you and look at them    they look miserable. That's exactly what people used to say to Sue. She wasn't miserable at all. But people used to say to her   Why are you so miserable   People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. Teachers and peers were underestimating her  she was teased at school. So she chose to have facial surgery. After the facial surgery  she said   My face now reflects my personality. People know now that I'm enthusiastic  that I'm a happy person.  And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers. Is this change  though  a real change  or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves  Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery. And what we found was    we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after    what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery. Well that's not surprising  but we also asked them to judge them on honesty  intelligence  friendliness  violence. They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics    more violent  etc.    before the surgery. After the surgery  they were perceived as being more intelligent  more friendly  more honest  less violent    and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character. When people get older  they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery. Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma. So this is a photograph of Henry  two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face    his cheekbone  his upper jaw  his eye socket. He looks pretty good at this stage. But over the course of the next    years he had    more operations  as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly. I learned a huge amount from Henry. Henry taught me that you can carry on working. He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket. He enjoyed life to the full  and this was probably because he had a successful  fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially. He maintained a calm insouciance. I don't say he overcame this  he didn't overcome it. This was something more than that. He ignored it. He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it. And that's what these people can do. Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well. This is a man in his   s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on. It was my longest operation. It took    hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon. We removed all the bones at the right side of his face    his eye  his nose  the skull bones  the facial skin    and reconstructed him with tissue from the back. He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse. He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah. And again  he said   This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.  His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family  he had a successful  fulfilling job. So we've seen that we can change people's faces. But when we change people's faces  are we changing their identity    for better or for worse  For instance  there are two different types of facial surgery. We can categorize it like that. We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery    like Sue. When they have facial surgery  they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people. They don't feel different. They feel that they've actually gained what they never had  that their face now reflects their personality. And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery. Because you might say   Well  this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic.  If you do cosmetic surgery  patients are often less happy. They're trying to achieve difference in their lives. Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life. She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality. But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery. They're people who have their face shot off. I'll move it off  and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you. They have it forced upon them. And again  as I told you  if they have a caring family and good work life  then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives. Their identity doesn't change. Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon  Muzetta's family give the lie to this. This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face  which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly. After she had surgery to remove the tumor  her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress  a pink ribbon in her hair  and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world  despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa. So it's not simply a Western phenomenon. We make judgments on people's faces all the time. It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces. He said you could see criminal faces  judging them just on the photographs that were showed. Good looking people are always judged as being more friendly. We look at O.J.    he's a good looking guy. We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly. Now we know that he's a convicted wife batterer  and actually he's not the good guy. And beauty doesn't equate to goodness  and certainly doesn't equate to contentment. So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face  but actually  we're more comfortable with judging the moving face. We think we can judge people on their expressions. U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity    the blink  the hesitation. And so they want to see live witnesses. Todorov tells us that  in a tenth of a second  we can make a judgment on somebody's face. Are we uncomfortable with this image  Yes  we are. Would we be happy if our doctor's face  our lawyer's face  our financial adviser's face was covered  We'd be pretty uncomfortable. But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement  The truth is that there's a five minute rule  not the tenth of a second rule like Todorov  but a five minute rule. If you spend five minutes with somebody  you start looking beyond their facial appearance  and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them  and the people who you didn't immediately seek out  because you didn't find them particularly attractive  become attractive people because of their personality. So we've talked a lot about facial appearance. I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do    where we're at and where we're going. This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. And you can see in the images afterward  we've managed to reconstruct her successfully. But that's not good enough. This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking  she wants to be out climbing mountains. And that's what she achieved  and that's what we have to get to. This is a horrific image  so I'm putting my hand up now. This is a photograph of Adi  a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery. And he lost his lower jaw  his lip  his chin and his upper jaw and teeth. This is the bar that he set for us.  I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.  So with modern technology  we used computers to make models. We made a model of the jaw without bone in it. We then bent a plate up to it. We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position. We then put bone and tissue from the back. Here you can see the plate holding it  and you can see the implants being put in    so that in one operation we achieve this and this. So the patient's life is restored. That's the good news. However  his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before. It's skin from his back. It's thicker  it's darker  it's coarser  it doesn't have the contours. And that's where we're failing  and that's where we need the face transplant. The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin. We can replace the underlying skeletal structure  but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin. So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium. But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. What does that mean  They have an increased risk of infection  an increased risk of malignancy. This is not a life saving transplant    like a heart  or liver  or lung transplant    it is a quality of life transplant  and as a result  are the patients going to say  if they get a malignant cancer    or    years on   I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer   We don't know yet. We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity. Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin  who did the first operation  are studying that. Donors are going to be short on the ground  because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death  So there are going to be problems with face transplantation. So the better news is the future's almost here    and the future is tissue engineering. Just imagine  I can make a biologically degradable template. I can put it in place where it's meant to be. I can sprinkle a few cells  stem cells from the patient's own hip  a little bit of genetically engineered protein  and lo and behold  leave it for four months and the face is grown. This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe. But we've still got problems. We've got mouth cancer to solve. We're still not curing enough patients    it's the most disfiguring cancer. We're still not reconstructing them well enough. In the U.K. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people. We still can't get rid of scars. We need to do research. And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research. And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future  so we don't just sit on our laurels and say   Okay  we're doing okay. Let's leave it as it is.  Thank you very much indeed. As a child  I was raised by native Hawaiian elders    three old women who took care of me while my parents worked. The year is     . We're at the ocean. It's twilight. We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides. It's a stretch of beach we know so well. The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us. If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes  you might dismiss them as poor and simple. That would be a mistake. These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators  trained in the old ways by their elders  and now they're passing it on to me. They teach me the names of the winds and the rains  of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars. There's a new moon on the horizon. Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing. They begin to chant.  Hawaiian chant  When they finish  they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them. They want to teach me about my destiny. I thought every seven year old went through this.  Baby girl  someday the world will be in trouble. People will forget their wisdom. It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance. You will go far away. It will sometimes be a lonely road. We will not be there. But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers  and you will recognize your ohana  your family. And it will take all of you. It will take all of you.  These words  I hold onto all my life. Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me. The year is     . I'm on a remote island in Micronesia. Satawal is one half mile long by one mile wide. It's the home of my mentor. His name is Pius Mau Piailug. Mau is a palu  a navigator priest. He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world. There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island. Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments. They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars  the sequence and direction of waves  the flight patterns of certain birds. Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy. When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull  it appeared that an old man was going to rest. In fact  the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel. It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves. Mau was  in fact  gathering explicit data using his entire body. It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. Now science may dismiss this methodology  but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel. The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance. Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island  and he would look out  and then he would say   Okay  we go.  He saw that first glint of light    he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now. Their achievements  intellectually and scientifically  are extraordinary  and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms. We are in such a critical moment of our collective history. They have been compared to astronauts    these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island. Their canoes  our rockets  their sea  our space. The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot. This is part of our collective narrative. It's humanity's DNA. We cannot afford to lose it. The year is     . Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted  the world is in trouble. We live in a society bloated with data  yet starved for wisdom. We're connected       yet anxiety  fear  depression and loneliness is at an all time high. We must course correct. An African shaman said   Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes.  The link between the past and the future is fragile. This I know intimately  because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them  I struggle. I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains. Mau passed away five months ago  but his legacy and lessons live on. And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them  as potent as the Micronesian navigators  that are going dismissed  that this is a testament to brilliant  brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly. Because when an elder dies a library is burned  and throughout the world  libraries are ablaze. I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate. And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way. And this is what he said   The island is the canoe  the canoe  the island.  And what he meant was  if you are voyaging and far from home  your very survival depends on everyone aboard. You cannot make the voyage alone  you were never meant to. This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. It always was. So in closing I would offer you this  The planet is our canoe  and we are the voyagers. True navigation begins in the human heart. It's the most important map of all. Together  may we journey well. I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here because I'm going to say some radical things  about how we should think about cancer differently  to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do. But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. And that this  in fact  will be the way that we treat cancer in the future. In order to talk about cancer  I'm going to actually have to    let me get the big slide here. First  I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics. I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on    and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about  which is proteomics. Having explained those  that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer. So let me start with genomics. It is the hot topic. It is the place where we're learning the most. This is the great frontier. But it has its limitations. And in particular  you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body  and if that were only true  it would be great  but it's not. It's like the parts list of your body. It doesn't say how things are connected  what causes what and so on. So if I can make an analogy  let's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant  a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant  and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder. So it might be that  if you went to a French restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn't have butter  you could say   Ah  I see what's wrong with them. I can make them healthy.  And there probably are special cases of that. You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder. So the list of ingredients does tell you something  and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. If they have tons of salt  you might guess they're using too much salt  or something like that. But it's limited  because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant  you need to taste the food  you need to know what goes on in the kitchen  you need the product of all of those ingredients. So if I look at a person and I look at a person's genome  it's the same thing. The part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients. And so indeed  there are times when we can find ingredients that  are  bad. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease  and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. But most things  you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen  because  mostly  sick people used to be healthy people    they have the same genome. So the genome really tells you much more about predisposition. So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list. But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person    except in some of these special cases. So why all the big deal about genetics  Well first of all  it's because we can read it  which is fantastic. It is very useful in certain circumstances. It's also the great theoretical triumph of biology. It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right. It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on. And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct. So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing  and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing  and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. So this happens in physics all the time. You predict a black hole  and you look out the telescope and there it is  just like you said. But it rarely happens in biology. So this great triumph    it's so good  there's almost a religious experience in biology. And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory. So the other reason it's been very popular is because we can measure it  it's digital. And in fact  thanks to Kary Mullis  you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients. So for instance  by measuring the genome  we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome  or how we're related to each other    the family tree  or the tree of life. There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity. Now of course  in medical application  that is very useful because it's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history    except probably  your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do. And so by reading the genome  we can find out much more about your family than you probably know. And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives  but they may be surprising. I did the   andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald. But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that. But mostly what you need to know  to find out if you're sick  is not your predispositions  but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. So to do that  what you really need to do  you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics  and that's what proteomics is about. Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes  proteomics is the study of all the proteins. And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells    actually  the machines that are operating    that's where the action is. Basically  a human body is a conversation going on  both within the cells and between the cells  and they're telling each other to grow and to die  and when you're sick  something's gone wrong with that conversation. And so the trick is    unfortunately  we don't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome. So the problem is that measuring    if you try to measure all the proteins  it's a very elaborate process. It requires hundreds of steps  and it takes a long  long time. And it matters how much of the protein it is. It could be very significant that a protein changed by    percent  so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA. And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage  they pause for just a moment  and they leave something in an enzyme for a second  and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way. People have tried very hard to do this. I tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it. I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus. And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems  and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back  so I kept on giving him to the delay list. And then one day  I get a call from John Doerr  Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus's phone call. So I was like   Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.  So we started talking  and he said   I really need a better way to measure proteins.  I'm like   Looked at that. Been there. Not going to be easy.  He's like   No  no. I really need it. I mean  I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them. We have to have a window into this.  And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it. And I realized  wow  this would really make a big difference  if we could do it  and so I said   Well  let's look at it.  Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything. So we started playing around with this. And as we did it  we realized this was the basic problem    that taking the sip of coffee    that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics. And so we did that  and working with David  we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually  which makes this robotic assembly line  which  in a very consistent way  measures the protein. And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like. Basically  what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient  and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh  how slippery they are  and we arrange them in an image. And so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood. And we can take a different one tomorrow  and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different    they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep. They really tell us what's going on there. And so this picture  which looks like a big smudge to you  is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track. So if I zoom into that picture  I can just show you what it means. We sort out the proteins    from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting  and from top to bottom is how slippery they are. So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it. And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein. And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump  bump  bump  bump  bump. And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that    carbon comes in different isotopes  so if it has an extra neutron on it  we actually measure it as a different chemical. So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one. And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is. So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time  and suddenly you say   Wow  it's way more complicated than we thought it was.  But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it. So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns. So what we do with this is  for example  we can look at two patients  one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug  and ask   What's going on differently inside of them   And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences. So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red. We overlay them. This is actual data. And you can see  mostly it overlaps and it's yellow  but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug  we see that in the blood  they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug. We might not even know what this protein is  but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease. So this already  I think  is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine. But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. So let me move to cancer. The thing about cancer    when I got into this  I really knew nothing about it  but working with David Agus  I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out. And as I looked at it  to me it didn't make sense how we were approaching cancer  and in order to make sense of it  I had to learn where did this come from. We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease. We're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill. So this is the great paradigm. This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked    was the germ theory of disease. So what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose    that is  put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis    and that works great for infectious diseases. So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis  we can give you penicillin. We know that that works. If you've got malaria  we give you quinine or some derivative of it. And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do  and it's miraculous in the case of infectious disease    how well it works. And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this. But now let's apply that to systems diseases like cancer. The problem is that  in cancer  there isn't something else that's inside of you. It's you  you're broken. That conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way. So how do we diagnose that conversation  Well  right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body    you know  where did it appear     and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body. And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer  and we treat these as if they're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong. And of course  it really doesn't have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system. And in fact  I think we're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing. I think this is the big mistake. I think cancer should not be a noun. We should talk about cancering as something we do  not something we have. And so those tumors  those are symptoms of cancer. And so your body is probably cancering all the time  but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control. And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb  imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing  and the way that we talked about it  we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say   Oh  my house has water.  We might divide it    the plumber would say   Well  where's the water    Well  it's in the kitchen.   Oh  you must have kitchen water.  That's kind of the level at which it is.  Kitchen water  well  first of all  we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it. And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen  that helps. Whereas living room water  it's better to do tar on the roof.  And it sounds silly  but that's basically what we do. And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer  but I'm saying that's not really the problem  that's the symptom of the problem. What we really need to get at is the process that's going on  and that's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions  happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does  Because normally  your body is dealing with this problem all the time. So your house is dealing with leaks all the time  but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on. So what we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on  and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that. David got me invited to give a talk at National Cancer Institute and Anna Barker was there. And so I gave this talk and said   Why don't you guys do this   And Anna said   Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way. But what we're going to do  is we're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research.  So David and I applied to this program and created a consortium at USC where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world  from Cold Spring Harbor  Stanford  Austin    I won't even go through and name all the places    to have a research project that will last for five years where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this. We're doing it in mice first  and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this  but they will die for a good cause. And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand  when cancer happens  what's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer. So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future. So I think eventually  once we have one of these models for people  which we'll get eventually    I mean  our group won't get all the way there    but eventually we'll have a very good computer model    sort of like a global climate model for weather. It has lots of different information about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales. And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer    and this also will be for ALS  or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases  things like that    we will simulate specifically you  not just a generic person  but what's actually going on inside you. And in that simulation  what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments  and it might be very gentle treatments  very small amounts of drugs. It might be things like  don't eat that day  or give them a little chemotherapy  maybe a little radiation. Of course  we'll do surgery sometimes and so on. But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health    guide your body back to health. Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong. We put it in the equivalent of splints. And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer  and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job. And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future. It's going to require a lot of work  a lot of research. There will be many teams like our team that work on this. But I think eventually  we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer. So thank you very much. Ten years ago exactly  I was in Afghanistan. I was covering the war in Afghanistan  and I witnessed  as a reporter for Al Jazeera  the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that. Then  two years later  I covered another war    the war in Iraq. I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq. And the war ended with a regime change  like the one in Afghanistan. And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship  an authoritarian regime  that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation  within the people themselves. However  the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world. For decades  we have lived under authoritarian regimes    in the Arab world  in the Middle East. These regimes created something within us during this period. I'm    years old right now. For the last    years  I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us    old  aged  authoritarian  corrupt situations    regimes that we have seen around us. And for a moment I was wondering  are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground  a change that does not come through foreign intervention  through the misery of occupation  through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes  The Iraqis  yes  they got rid of Saddam Hussein  but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad  they felt that their dignity had suffered. And this is why they revolted. This is why they did not accept. And actually other regimes  they told their citizens   Would you like to see the situation of Iraq  Would you like to see civil war  sectarian killing  Would you like to see destruction  Would you like to see foreign troops on your land   And the people thought for themselves   Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in  instead of having the second scenario.  That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen. For    years  unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction  images of killing  of sectarian conflicts  images of violence  emerging from a magnificent piece of land  a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years. Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived. A new generation  well educated  connected  inspired by universal values and a global understanding  has created a new reality for us. We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams  these young people who have restored self confidence in our nations in that part of the world  who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets. Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing. Just step out of your house  raise your voice and say   We would like to see the end of the regime.  This is what happened in Tunisia. Over a few days  the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies  billions of dollars in maintaining  trying to maintain  its prisons  collapsed  disappeared  because of the voices of the public. People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices  they tried to kill. The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people. They found something called Facebook. They found something called Twitter. They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues. And they said   These kids are misled.  Therefore  they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them  bring them back home. This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.  Bring these kids home because they are misled.  But yes  these youth who have been inspired by universal values  who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and  at the same time  realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it    not using violence  not trying to create chaos    these young people  they did not go home. Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them. And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia. We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years  and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there. But we found that these people in the street  all of them are our reporters  feeding our newsroom with pictures  with videos and with news. And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people    people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority. And then we took that decision  We are unrolling the news. We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people. We are going to spread the message. Yes  some of these young people are connected to the Internet  but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little  is very small  because of many problems that we are suffering from. But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified  it . We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world    and internationally  globally  through our English channel. And then people started to feel that there's something new happening. And then Zine al Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave. And then Egypt started  and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave. And now Libya as you see it. And then you have Yemen. And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of   How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant   I want to tell you something  that the Internet and connectivity has created  a  new mindset. But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from. And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change  before we thought  and governments told us    and even sometimes it was true    that change was imposed on us  and people rejected that  because they thought that it is alien to their culture. Always  we believed that change will spring from within  that change should be a reconciliation with culture  cultural diversity  with our faith in our tradition and in our history  but at the same time  open to universal values  connected with the world  tolerant to the outside. And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world. This is the right moment  and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region. How did the elite deal with that    the so called political elite  In front of Facebook  they brought the camels in Tahrir Square. In front of Al Jazeera  they started creating tribalism. And then when they failed  they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world. They started telling the West   Be aware of Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is taking over our territories. These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras. Be aware of these people who  are  coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization.  Fortunately  people right now cannot be deceived. Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception. They could not  and they cannot  imagine how they could really deal with this reality. They have lost. They have been detached from their people  from the masses  and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other. Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution. We do not create revolutions. However  when something of that magnitude happens  we are at the center of the coverage. We were banned from Egypt  and our correspondents  some of them were arrested. But most of our camera people and our journalists  they went underground in Egypt    voluntarily    to report what happened in Tahrir Square. For    days  our cameras were broadcasting  live  the voices of the people in Tahrir Square. I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone    ordinary person who I don't know    from Tahrir Square. He told me   We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras. If you switch off the cameras tonight  there will be a genocide. You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square.  I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them   Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night  because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story    and they feel protected as well.  So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world. We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world. Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran  of  the  Mosaddeq revolution. Let us free ourselves    especially in the West    from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest  or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security. The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction. Let us accept the choice of the people. Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future. The future should be ruled by people themselves  even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us. But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world  for the West and the East  to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world  rather than the images of violence and terrorism. Let us support these people. Let us stand for them. And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change  and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance. The future has arrived  and the future is now. I thank you very much. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I just have a couple of questions for you. Thank you for coming here. How would you characterize the historical significance of what's happened  Is this a story of the year  a story of the decade or something more  Wadah Khanfar  Actually  this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered. We have covered many wars. We have covered a lot of tragedies  a lot of problems  a lot of conflict zones  a lot of hot spots in the region  because we were centered at the middle of it. But this is a story    it is a great story  it is beautiful. It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident. You are witnessing change in history. You are witnessing the birth of a new era. And this is what the story's all about. CA  There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical  or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos. You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now  that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly  WK  And people actually  after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime  the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils  they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy  but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational  not to go out of order. In my opinion  these people are much more wiser than  not only the political elite  even the intellectual elite  even opposition leaders including political parties. At this moment in time  the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old    including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes. CA  We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way. What should people here at TED  here in the West  do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here  WK  I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world    that people care  people care about this great transformation. Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us  the head of Aljazeera.net  he told me that a       percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world. Fifty percent of it is coming from America. Because we discovered that people care  and people would like to know    they are receiving the stream through our Internet. Unfortunately in the United States  we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English. But I can tell you  this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling  universal feeling  of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us. CA  Well Wadah  a group of members of the TED community  TEDxCairo  are meeting as we speak. They've had some speakers there. I believe they've heard your talk. Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us. Thank you so much. Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris  and the phone rang and I heard   Hey  JR  you won the TED Prize     . You have to make a wish to save the world.  I was lost. I mean  I can't save the world. Nobody can. The world is fucked up. Come on  you have dictators ruling the world  population is growing by millions  there's no more fish in the sea  the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said  we're all becoming fat. Except maybe French people. Whatever. So I called back and I told her   Look  Amy  tell the TED guys I just won't show up. I can't do anything to save the world.  She said   Hey  JR  your wish is not to save the world  but to change the world.   Oh  all right.   That's cool.  I mean  technology  politics  business do change the world    not always in a good way  but they do. What about art  Could art change the world  I started when I was    years old. And at that time  I was not thinking about changing the world. I was doing graffiti    writing my name everywhere  using the city as a canvas. I was going in the tunnels of Paris  on the rooftops with my friends. Each trip was an excursion  was an adventure. It was like leaving our mark on society  to say   I was here   on the top of a building. So when I found a cheap camera on the subway  I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies    really small photos just that size. That's how  at    years old  I started pasting them. And I did my first  expo de rue   which means sidewalk gallery. And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising. I mean  the city's the best gallery I could imagine. I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people. I would control it directly with the public in the streets. So that's Paris. I would change    depending on the places I would go    the title of the exhibition. That's on the Champs Elysees. I was quite proud of that one. Because I was just    and I was just up there on the top of the Champs Elysees. Then when the photo left  the frame was still there. November       the streets are burning. A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris. Everyone was glued to the TV  watching disturbing  frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood. I mean  these kids  without control  throwing Molotov cocktails  attacking the cops and the firemen  looting everything they could in the shops. These were criminals  thugs  dangerous  destroying their own environment. And then I saw it    could it be possible     my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car    a pasting I'd done a year earlier    an illegal one    still there. I mean  these were the faces of my friends. I know those guys. All of them are not angels  but they're not monsters either. So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television. So I went back there with a    mm lens. It was the only one I had at that time. But with that lens  you have to be as close as    inches from the person. So you can do it only with their trust. So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet. They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves. And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name  age  even building number of these guys. A year later  the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. And we go from thug images  who've been stolen and distorted by the media  who's now proudly taking over his own image. That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. So could art change the world  A year later  I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict. I mean  at that time  trust me  they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. So with my friend Marco  we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. Are they so different  When we got there  we just went in the street  started talking with people everywhere  and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs    taxi driver  lawyer  cooks. Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment. Not a smile    that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel. They all accepted to be pasted next to the other. I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall. We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. We called the project Face   Face. The experts said   No way. The people will not accept. The army will shoot you  and Hamas will kidnap you.  We said   Okay  let's try and push as far as we can.  I love the way that people will ask me   How big will my photo be    It will be as big as your house.  When we did the wall  we did the Palestinian side. So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. And so Palestinians guys say   Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution.  So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. We did Face   Face with only six friends  two ladders  two brushes  a rented car  a camera and        square feet of paper. We had all sorts of help from all walks of life. Okay  for example  that's Palestine. We're in Ramallah right now. We're pasting portraits    so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market. People come around us and start asking   What are you doing here    Oh  we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job. And those ones are actually two taxi drivers.  And then there was always a silence.  You mean you're pasting an Israeli face    doing a face    right here    Well  yeah  yeah  that's part of the project.  And I would always leave that moment  and we would ask them   So can you tell me who is who   And most of them couldn't say. We even pasted on Israeli military towers  and nothing happened. When you paste an image  it's just paper and glue. People can tear it  tag on it  or even pee on it    some are a bit high for that  I agree    but the people in the street  they are the curator. The rain and the wind will take them off anyway. They are not meant to stay. But exactly four years after  the photos  most of them are still there. Face   Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible    and  you know what  even easy. We didn't push the limit  we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. In the Middle East  I experienced my work in places without  many  museums. So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting. So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums. When you go in these developing societies  women are the pillars of their community  but the men are still the ones holding the streets. So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos. I called that project Women Are Heroes. When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents  I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict. I just observed. Sometimes there was no words  no sentence  just tears. I just took their pictures and pasted them. Women Are Heroes took me around the world. Most of the places I went to  I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media. So for example  in June       I was watching TV in Paris  and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro    the first favela of Brazil named Providencia. Three kids    that was three students    were  detained  by the army because they were not carrying their papers. And the army took them  and instead of bringing them to the police station  they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. I was shocked. All Brazil was shocked. I heard it was one of the most violent favelas  because the largest drug cartel controls it. So I decided to go there. When I arrived    I mean  I didn't have any contact with any NGO. There was none in place    no association  no NGOs  nothing    no eyewitnesses. So we just walked around  and we met a woman  and I showed her my book. And she said   You know what  We're hungry for culture. We need culture out there.  So I went out and I started with the kids. I just took a few photos of the kids  and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. The day after  I came back and they were already scratched. But that's okay. I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them. Then the next day  I held a meeting on the main square and some women came. They were all linked to the three kids that got killed. There was the mother  the grandmother  the best friend    they all wanted to shout the story. After that day  everyone in the favela gave me the green light. I took more photos  and we started the project. The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place  so I told them   You know what  I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons. You see that enough in the media. What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. I've been seeing it around me the last few days.  So that's a really symbolic pasting  because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city. And that's where the three kids got arrested  and that's the grandmother of one of them. And on that stairs  that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire. Everyone there understood the project. And then we pasted everywhere    the whole hill. What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. I mean  you should see that. They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens  and we would see ourselves  on TV  pasting. And they would put a number   Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia.  We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know. So how can we know about the project  So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them. So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women. We kept traveling. We went to Africa  Sudan  Sierra Leone  Liberia  Kenya. In war torn places like Monrovia  people come straight to you. I mean  they want to know what you're up to. They kept asking me   What is the purpose of your project  Are you an NGO  Are you the media   Art. Just doing art. Some people question   Why is it in black and white  Don't you have color in France   Or they tell you   Are these people all dead   Some who understood the project would explain it to others. And to a man who did not understand  I heard someone say   You know  you've been here for a few hours trying to understand  discussing with your fellows. During that time  you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow. This is art.  I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects. And then it becomes more. It becomes a desire  a need  an armor. On this bridge that's in Monrovia  ex rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war. Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict. This is Kibera  Kenya  one of the largest slums of Africa. You might have seen images about the post election violence that happened there in     . This time we covered the roofs of the houses  but we didn't use paper  because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house    vinyl does. Then art becomes useful. So the people kept it. You know what I love is  for example  when you see the biggest eye there  there are so  many  houses inside. And I went there a few months ago    photos are still there    and it was missing a piece of the eye. So I asked the people what happened.  Oh  that guy just moved.  When the roofs were covered  a woman said as a joke   Now God can see me.  When you look at Kibera now  they look back. Okay  India. Before I start that  just so you know  each time we go to a place  we don't have authorization  so we set up like commandos    we're a group of friends who arrive there  and we try to paste on the walls. But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. In India it was just impossible to paste. I heard culturally and because of the law  they would just arrest us at the first pasting. So we decided to paste white  white on the walls. So imagine white guys pasting white papers. So people would come to us and ask us   Hey  what are you up to    Oh  you know  we're just doing art.   Art   Of course  they were confused. But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets  and the more dust you would have going up in the air  on the white paper you can almost see  but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. So the more dust you have  the more it will reveal the photo. So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. Thank you. So we didn't get caught this time. Each project    that's a film from Women Are Heroes. Okay. For each project we do a film. And most of what you see    that's a trailer from  Women Are Heroes     its images  photography  taken one after the other. And the photos kept traveling even without us. Hopefully  you'll see the film  and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos. Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo. Behind each image is a story. Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities  and the women kept that dynamic after we left. For example  we did books    not for sale    that all the community would get. But to get it  they would have to  get  it signed by one of the women. We did that in most of the places. We go back regularly. And so in Providencia  for example  in the favela  we have a cultural center running there. In Kibera  each year we cover more roofs. Because of course  when we left  the people who were just at the edge of the project said   Hey  what about my roof   So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project. A really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors. So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects. And that is for me one of the more important things in the work. I think  today  as important as the result is the way you do things. And that has always been a central part of the work. And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising. We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum. But yesterday the city called them and said   Look  you're going to have to tear it down. Because this can be taken for advertising  and because of the law  it has to be taken down.  But tell me  advertising for what  The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community. But they asked me for a promise basically. They asked me   Please  make our story travel with you.  So I did. That's Paris. That's Rio. In each place  we built exhibitions with a story  and the story traveled. You understand the full scope of the project. That's London. New York. And today  they are with you in Long Beach. All right  recently I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore. I use Man Ray  Helen Levitt  Giacomelli  other people's artwork. It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not. The importance is what you do with the images  the statement it makes where it's pasted. So for example  I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country. This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally  and I pasted it in Southern Italy  where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground. In some ways  art can change the world. Art is not supposed to change the world  to change practical things  but to change perceptions. Art can change the way we see the world. Art can create an analogy. Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions  and then enables you to change the world. When I do my work  I have two kinds of reactions. People say   Oh  why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan. They would be really useful.  Or   How can we help   I presume that you belong to the second category  and that's good  because for that project  I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them. So now my wish is  I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project  and together we'll turn the world inside out. And this starts right now. Yes  everyone in the room. Everyone watching. I wanted that wish to actually start now. So a subject you're passionate about  a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos    tell me what you stand for. Take the photos  the portraits  upload it    I'll give you all the details    and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world. The full data is on the website    insideoutproject.net    that is launching today. What we see changes who we are. When we act together  the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts. So I hope that  together  we'll create something that the world will remember. And this starts right now and depends on you. Thank you. Thank you. This is Revolution  . . No one was a hero. No one was a hero. Because everyone was a hero. Everyone has done something. We all use Wikipedia. If you think of the concept of Wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content  and at the end of the day you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world. From just an idea that sounded crazy  you have the largest encyclopedia in the world. And in the Egyptian revolution  the Revolution  .   everyone has contributed something  small or big. They contributed something    to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions. It was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing. If you look at the scene  Egypt  for    years  had been in a downhill    going into a downhill. Everything was going bad. Everything was going wrong. We only ranked high when it comes to poverty  corruption  lack of freedom of speech  lack of political activism. Those were the achievements of our great regime. Yet  nothing was happening. And it's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated. In fact  people were extremely frustrated. But the reason why everyone was silent is what I call the psychological barrier of fear. Everyone was scared. Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians that I have to thank for being so brave    going into protests as a couple of hundred  getting beaten up and arrested. But in fact  the majority were scared. Everyone did not want really to get in trouble. A dictator cannot live without the force. They want to make people live in fear. And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years  and here comes the Internet  technology  BlackBerry  SMS. It's helping all of us to connect. Platforms like YouTube  Twitter  Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that   Wow  I'm not alone. There are a lot of people who are frustrated.  There are lots of people who are frustrated. There are lots of people who actually share the same dream. There are lots of people who care about their freedom. They probably have the best life in the world. They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas. They are happy. They don't have problems. But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian. A lot of us  we're not really happy when we see a video of an Egyptian man who's eating the trash while others are stealing billions of Egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country. The Internet has played a great role  helping these people to speak up their minds  to collaborate together  to start thinking together. It was an educational campaign. Khaled Saeed was killed in June     . I still remember the photo. I still remember every single detail of that photo. The photo was horrible. He was tortured  brutally tortured to death. But then what was the answer of the regime   He choked on a pile of hash     that was their answer   He's a criminal. He's someone who escaped from all these bad things.  But people did not relate to this. People did not believe this. Because of the Internet  the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth. And everyone started to think that  this guy could be my brother.  He was a middle class guy. His photo was remembered by all of us. A page was created. An anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page  and there was no plan.  What are we going to do    I don't know.  In a few days  tens of thousands of people there    angry Egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs   Enough. Get those who killed this guy. To just bring them to justice.  But of course  they don't listen. It was an amazing story    how everyone started feeling the ownership. Everyone was an owner in this page. People started contributing ideas. In fact  one of the most ridiculous ideas was   Hey  let's have a silent stand. Let's get people to go in the street  face the sea  their back to the street  dressed in black  standing up silently for one hour  doing nothing and then just leaving  going back home.  For some people  that was like   Wow  silent stand. And next time it's going to be vibration.  People were making fun of the idea. But actually when people went to the street    the first time it was thousands of people in Alexandria    it felt like    it was amazing. It was great because it connected people from the virtual world  bringing them to the real world  sharing the same dream  the same frustration  the same anger  the same desire for freedom. And they were doing this thing. But did the regime learn anything  Not really. They were actually attacking them. They were actually abusing them  despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were    they were not even protesting. And things had developed until the Tunisian revolution. This whole page was  again  managed by the people. In fact  the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas  help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing. People were taking shots and photos  people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt  people were suggesting ideas  they were actually voting on ideas  and then they were executing the ideas  people were creating videos. Everything was done by the people to the people  and that's the power of the Internet. There was no leader. The leader was everyone on that page. The Tunisian experiment  as Amir was saying  inspired all of us  showed us that there is a way. Yes we can. We can do it. We have the same problems  we can just go in the streets. And when I saw the street on the   th  I went back and said   Egypt before the   th is never going to be Egypt after the   th. The revolution is happening. This is not the end  this is the beginning of the end.  I was detained on the   th night. Thank God I announced the locations and everything. But they detained me. And I'm not going to talk about my experience  because this is not about me. I was detained for    days  blindfolded  handcuffed. And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything. I was not allowed to speak with anyone. And I went out. The next day I was in Tahrir. Seriously  with the amount of change I had noticed in this square  I thought it was    years. I never had in my mind to see this Egyptian  the amazing Egyptian. The fear is no longer fear. It's actually strength    it's power. People were so empowered. It was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights. Completely opposite. Extremism became tolerance. Who would  have  imagined before the   th  if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them  and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them    this is amazing. All the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so called propaganda  or mainstream media  are proven wrong. This whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the Egyptian man  the Egyptian woman  how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream. When I saw that  I went back and I wrote on Facebook. And that was a personal belief  regardless of what's going on  regardless of the details. I said that   We are going to win. We are going to win because we don't understand politics. We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games. We're going to win because we don't have an agenda. We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. We're going to win because we have dreams. We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams.  And that's actually what happened. We won. And that's not because of anything  but because we believed in our dream. The winning here is not the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene. The winning is the winning of the dignity of every single Egyptian. Actually  I had this taxi driver telling me   Listen  I am breathing freedom. I feel that I have dignity that I have lost for so many years.  For me that's winning  regardless of all the details. My last word to you is a statement I believe in  which Egyptians have proven to be true  that the power of the people is much stronger than the people in power. Thanks a lot. Well  this is about state budgets. This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning. But I want to tell you  I think it's an important topic that we need to care about. State budgets are big  big money    I'll show you the numbers    and they get very little scrutiny. The understanding is very low. Many of the people involved have special interests or short term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are. And these budgets are the key for our future  they're the key for our kids. Most education funding    whether it's K through     or the great universities or community colleges    most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets. But we have a problem. Here's the overall picture. U.S. economy is big      .  trillion. Now out of that pie  the government spends    percent. So this is combining the federal level  which is the largest  the state level and the local level. And it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on  because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries. But we're spending    percent. Well what are we taking in  Simple business question. Answer is    percent. Now this leaves    percent deficit  sort of a mind blowing number. And some of that  in fact  is due to the fact that we've had an economic recession. Receipts go down  some spending programs go up  but most of it is not because of that. Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends  and that creates a huge challenge. In fact  this is the forecast picture. There are various things in here  I could say we might raise more revenue  or medical innovation will make the spending even higher. It is an increasingly difficult picture  even assuming the economy does quite well    probably better than it will do. This is what you see at this overall level. Now how did we get here  How could you have a problem like this  After all  at least on paper  there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced. Only one state says they don't have to balance the budget. But what this means actually is that there's a pretense. There's no real  true balancing going on  and in a sense  the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straight forward challenges. When Jerry Brown was elected  this was the challenge that was put to him. That is  through various gimmicks and things  a so called balanced budget had led him to have    billion missing out of the    billion in proposed spending. Now he's put together some thoughts  About half of that he'll cut  another half  perhaps in a very complex set of steps  taxes will be approved. But even so  as you go out into those future years  various pension costs  health costs go up enough  and the revenue does not go up enough. So you get a big squeeze. What were those things that allowed us to hide this  Well  some really nice little tricks. And these were somewhat noticed. The paper said   It's not really balanced. It's got holes. It perpetuates deficit spending. It's riddled with gimmicks.  And really when you get down to it  the guys at Enron never would have done this. This is so blatant  so extreme. Is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do  They borrow money. They're not supposed to  but they figure out a way. They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out. They sell off the assets. They defer the payments. They sell off the revenues from tobacco. And California's not unique. In fact  there's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don't face this big challenge. So it's systemic across the entire country. It really comes from the fact that certain long term obligations    health care  where innovation makes it more expensive  early retirement and pension  where the age structure gets worse for you  and just generosity    that these mis accounting things allow to develop over time  that you've got a problem. This is the retiree health care benefits. Three million set aside     billion dollar liability    much worse than the car companies. And everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem. The forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from    percent of the budget to    percent. Well what's going to give  Well in order to accommodate that  you would have to cut education spending in half. It really is this young versus the old to some degree. If you don't change that revenue picture  if you don't solve what you're doing in health care  you're going to be deinvesting in the young. The great University of California university system  the great things that have gone on  won't happen. So far it's meant layoffs  increased class sizes. Within the education community there's this discussion of   Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off  or the less good teachers who get laid off   And there's a discussion  if you're going to increase class sizes  where do you do that  How much effect does that have  And unfortunately  as you get into that  people get confused and think  well maybe you think that's okay. In fact  no  education spending should not be cut. There's ways  if it's temporary  to minimize the impact  but it's a problem. It's also really a problem for where we need to go. Technology has a role to play. Well we need money to experiment with that  to get those tools in there. There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness  measuring them  giving them feedback  taking videos in the classroom. That's something I think is very  very important. Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay. In a situation where you have growth  you put the new money into this. Or even if you're flat  you might shift money into it. But with the type of cuts we're talking about  it will be far  far harder to get these incentives for excellence  or to move over to use technology in the new way. So what's going on  Where's the brain trust that's in error here  Well there really is no brain trust. It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up. Just look at this spending. California will spend over     billion  Microsoft      Google  about   . The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis  both inside Google and Microsoft and outside  with analysts and people of various opinions    should they have spent on that  No  they wasted their money on this. What about this thing     it really is quite phenomenal. Everybody has an opinion. There's great feedback. And the numbers are used to make decisions. If you go over the education spending and the health care spending    particularly these long term trends    you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity  in terms of learning. So what do we need to do  We need better tools. We can get some things out on the Internet. I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture. We need lots more. There's a few good books  one about school spending and where the money comes from    how that's changed over time  and the challenge. We need better accounting. We need to take the fact that the current employees  the future liabilities they create  that should come out of the current budget. We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have. It should be more like private accounting. It's the gold standard. And finally  we need to really reward politicians. Whenever they say there's these long term problems  we can't say   Oh  you're the messenger with bad news  We just shot you.  In fact  there are some like these  Erskine Bowles  Alan Simpson and others  who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health spending state level problem. But in fact  their work was sort of pushed off. In fact  the week afterwards  some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions. So we need these pieces. Now I think this is a solvable problem. It's a great country with lots of people. But we have to draw those people in  because this is about education. And just look at what happened with the tuitions with the University of California and project that out for another three  four  five years    it's unaffordable. And that's the kind of thing    the investment in the young    that makes us great  allows us to contribute. It allows us to do the art  the biotechnology  the software and all those magic things. And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future. Thank you. There's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs. The fact is that we're living longer. Medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer  and the problem is  as we age  our organs tend to fail more  and so currently there are not enough organs to go around. In fact  in the last    years  the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled  while in the same time  the actual number of transplants has barely gone up. So this is now a public health crisis. So that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine. It really involves many different areas. You can use  actually  scaffolds  biomaterials    they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt    but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate. Or we can use cells alone  either your very own cells or different stem cell populations. Or we can use both. We can use  actually  biomaterials and the cells together. And that's where the field is today. But it's actually not a new field. Interestingly  this is a book that was published back in     . It's titled  The Culture of Organs.  The first author  Alexis Carrel  a Nobel Prize winner. He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels  and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis. But I want you to note his co author  Charles Lindbergh. That's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs. So if the field's been around for so long  why so few clinical advances  And that really has to do to many different challenges. But if I were to point to three challenges  the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time. And many advances now  we can do that fairly readily. The second challenge was cells. We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body. Over the last    years  we've basically tackled that. Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells. Plus we have stem cells. But even now        there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient. Liver cells  nerve cells  pancreatic cells    we still can't grow them even today. And the third challenge is vascularity  the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them. So we can actually use biomaterials now. This is actually a biomaterial. We can weave them  knit them  or we can make them like you see here. This is actually like a cotton candy machine. You saw the spray going in. That was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure  this tubularized structure  which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so. And that's exactly what we did here. This is actually a patient who  was  presented with a deceased organ  and we then created one of these smart biomaterials  and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient's structure. What we did was we actually used the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge  if you will  and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue. And you see that patient now six months after with an X ray showing you the regenerated tissue  which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope. We can also use cells alone. These are actually cells that we obtained. These are stem cells that we create from specific sources  and we can drive them to become heart cells  and they start beating in culture. So they know what to do. The cells genetically know what to do  and they start beating together. Now today  many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease. So that's actually now in patients. Or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures  we can then use the patient's own cells  or some cell population  and the biomaterials  the scaffolds  together. So the concept here  so if you do have a deceased or injured organ  we take a very small piece of that tissue  less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the cells apart  we grow the cells outside the body. We then take a scaffold  a biomaterial    again  looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt    we then shape that material  and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time    very much like baking a layer cake  if you will. We then place it in an oven like device  and we're able to create that structure and bring it out. This is actually a heart valve that we've engineered  and you can see here  we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seeded that with cells  and then we exercise it. So you see the leaflets opening and closing    of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies. Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders. We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient    less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then grow the cells outside the body  take the scaffold  coat the scaffold with the cells    the patient's own cells  two different cell types. We then put it in this oven like device. It has the same conditions as the human body       degrees centigrade     percent oxygen. A few weeks later  you have your engineered organ that we're able to implant back into the patient. For these specific patients  we actually just suture these materials. We use three dimensional imagining analysis  but we actually created these biomaterials by hand. But we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells. We use now some type of technologies  where for solid organs  for example  like the liver  what we do is we take discard livers. As you know  a lot of organs are actually discarded  not used. So we can take these liver structures  which are not going to be used  and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away. Two weeks later  you have something that looks like a liver. You can hold it like a liver  but it has no cells  it's just a skeleton of the liver. And we then can re perfuse the liver with cells  preserving the blood vessel tree. So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells  and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells. And we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology. Another technology that we've used is actually that of printing. This is actually a desktop inkjet printer  but instead of using ink  we're using cells. And you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure  and it takes about    minutes to print this structure. And there's a  D elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through. And then finally you're able to get that structure out. You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it. And this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here. That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques. Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now  our next generation of technologies  are more sophisticated printers. This particular printer we're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient. So what you see here    I know it sounds funny  but that's the way it works. Because in reality  what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound  and you have a scanner  basically like a flatbed scanner. That's what you see here on the right side. You see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves. This is how it actually works. Here's the scanner going through  scanning the wound. Once it's scanned  it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be. And now you're going to see here a demo of this actually being done in a representative wound. And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material. So once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be. And this is actually new technology still under development. We're also working on more sophisticated printers. Because in reality  our biggest challenge are the solid organs. I don't know if you realize this  but    percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney. Patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around. So this is more challenging    large organ  vascular  a lot of blood vessel supply  a lot of cells present. So the strategy here is    this is actually a CT scan  an X ray    and we go layer by layer  using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and  D reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys. We then are able to actually image those  do     degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics  and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form. So we go layer by layer through the organ  analyzing each layer as we go through the organ  and we then are able to send that information  as you see here  through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient. This actually shows the actual printer. And this actually shows that printing. In fact  we actually have the printer right here. So while we've been talking today  you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage. That's actually the actual printer right now  and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here. It takes about seven hours to print a kidney  so this is about three hours into it now. And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now  and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today. Put a pair of gloves here. Thank you. Go backwards. So  these gloves are a little bit small on me  but here it is. You can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today. Has a little bit of consistency to it. This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project  and part of our team. Thank you  Dr. Kang. I appreciate it. So this is actually a new generation. This is actually the printer that you see here onstage. And this is actually a new technology we're working on now. In reality  we now have a long history of doing this. I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while. And this is actually a very brief clip    only about    seconds    of a patient who actually received an organ. I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable. I couldn't go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside. I felt so sick. I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis  and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that. So after the surgery  life got a lot better for me. I was able to do more things. I was able to wrestle in high school. I became the captain of the team  and that was great. I was able to be a normal kid with my friends. And because they used my own cells to build this bladder  it's going to be with me. I've got it for life  so I'm all set. Juan Enriquez  These experiments sometimes work  and it's very cool when they do. Luke  come up please. So Luke  before last night  when's the last time you saw Tony  LM  Ten years ago  when I had my surgery    and it's really great to see him. JE  And tell us a little bit about what you're doing. LM  Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut. I'm a sophomore and studying communications  TV and mass media  and basically trying to live life like a normal kid  which I always wanted growing up. But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working. I went through about    surgeries  and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was   . And this surgery came along and basically made me who I am today and saved my life. JE  And Tony's done hundreds of these  LM  What I know from  he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff. I know I was one of the first    people to have this surgery. And when I was     I didn't realize how amazing it was. I was a little kid  and I was like   Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery.  All I wanted to do was to get better  and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing. JE  When you got this call out of the blue    Tony's really shy  and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke. So Luke  you go to your communications professors    you're majoring in communications    and you ask them for permission to come to TED  which might have a little bit to do with communications  and what was their reaction  LM  Most of my professors were all for it  and they said   Bring pictures and show me the clips online   and  I'm happy for you.  There were a couple that were a little stubborn  but I had to talk to them. I pulled them aside. JE  Well  it's an honor and a privilege to meet you. Thank you so much.  LM  Thank you so much.  JE  Thank you  Tony. So I was born on the last day of the last year of the '  s. I was raised on  Free to be you and me     hip hop    not as many woohoos for hip hop in the house. Thank you. Thank you for hip hop    and Anita Hill. My parents were radicals    who became  well  grown ups. My dad facetiously says   We wanted to save the world  and instead we just got rich.  We actually just got  middle class  in Colorado Springs  Colorado  but you get the picture. I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy. At this ripe old age of     I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible  beautiful time  and I've decided  for me  it's been a real journey and paradox. The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it. Feminism was the water I grew up in. When I was just a little girl  my mom started what is now the longest running women's film festival in the world. So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons  I was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women. You can see how this had an influence. But she was not the only feminist in the house. My dad actually resigned from the male only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son  but not his daughter. He's actually here today. The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet  not a businessman  but the intention was really good. In any case  I didn't readily claim the feminist label  even though it was all around me  because I associated it with my mom's women's groups  her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads    none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time. But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing  so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them    never  of course  admitting that I was doing so. I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time. They were the co authors of a book called  Manifesta.  So what very profound epiphany  you might ask  was responsible for my feminist click moment  Fishnet stockings. Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them. I thought they were really hot. I decided  okay  I can claim the feminist label. Now I tell you this    I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself  because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics  that beauty  that fun do matter. There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness. Anyone heard of these two guys as an example  So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's  but it looks very different. My mom says   patriarchy.  I say   intersectionality.  So race  class  gender  ability  all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman. Pay equity  Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue. But for me  so is immigration.  Applause  Thank you. My mom says   Protest march.  I say   Online organizing.  I co edit  along with a collective of other super smart  amazing women  a site called Feministing.com. We are the most widely read feminist publication ever  and I tell you this because I think it's really important to see that there's a continuum. Feminist blogging is basically the   st century version of consciousness raising. But we also have a straightforward political impact. Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart. We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate mail fired from a Big Ten school. And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say   I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site. I realized feminism wasn't about man hating and Birkenstocks.  So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way. My mom says   Gloria Steinem.  I say   Samhita Mukhopadhyay  Miriam Perez  Ann Friedman  Jessica Valenti  Vanessa Valenti  and on and on and on and on.  We don't want one hero. We don't want one icon. We don't want one face. We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing  community organizing  changing institutions from the inside out    all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started. Thank you. Which brings me to the second paradox  sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once. Many in my generation    because of well intentioned parenting and self esteem education    were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes    who were going to go out and save the world. These are three words many of us were raised with. We walk across graduation stages  high on our overblown expectations  and when we float back down to earth  we realize we don't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway. The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic  and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed. And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about  to be fair    an environmental crisis  wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since       and globally  a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity. Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls. It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed. I experienced this firsthand myself when I graduated from Barnard College in     . I was fired up  I was ready to make a difference. I went out and I worked at a non profit  I went to grad school  I phone banked  I protested  I volunteered  and none of it seemed to matter. And on a particularly dark night of December of       I sat down with my family  and I said that I had become very disillusioned. I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy    kind of a dark fantasy    of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps. My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze  her eyes really welled with tears  and she looked right at me and she said   I will not stand for your desperation.  She said   You are smarter  more creative and more resilient than that.  Which brings me to my third paradox. Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well. There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by  Parker Palmer  and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed  between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves.  You may have guessed by now  I did not light myself on fire. I did what I know to do in desperation  which is write. I wrote the book I needed to read. I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work. I wrote about Nia Martin Robinson  the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists  who's dedicating her life to environmental justice. I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do  but quickly learned  not only did she not like it  but she wasn't really good at it. Instead  what she really wanted to do was make films. So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact. I wrote about Maricela Guzman  the daughter of Mexican immigrants  who joined the military so she could afford college. She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network. What I learned from these people and others was that I couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals. Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems    the military  congress  the education system  etc. But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force. And at the end of the day  what could possibly be more important than that  Cornel West says   Of course it's a failure. But how good a failure is it   This isn't to say we give up our wildest  biggest dreams. It's to say we operate on two levels. On one  we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part. But on the other  we root our self esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day more kind  more just  etc. So when I was a little girl  I had a couple of very strange habits. One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home  and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand. I was listening to her talk on the phone  which she did a lot. She was talking about board meetings  she was founding peace organizations  she was coordinating carpools  she was consoling friends    all these daily acts of care and creativity. And surely  at three and four years old  I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice  but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work. The activists I interviewed had nothing in common  literally  except for one thing  which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences. So often  particularly at a young age  we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life  and sometimes they're in our own kitchens  talking on the phone  making us dinner  doing all that keeps the world going around and around. My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory  or certainty  or security even. It's about embracing the paradox. It's about acting in the face of overwhelm. And it's about loving people really well. And at the end of the day  these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward. Thank you. Khan Academy is most known for its collection of videos  so before I go any further  let me show you a little bit of a montage. This animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America    a nice clean band here    and this part of Africa. We can integrate over the surface  and the notation usually is a capital sigma. National Assembly  They create the Committee of Public Safety  which sounds like a very nice committee. Notice  this is an aldehyde  and it's an alcohol. Start differentiating into effector and memory cells. A galaxy. Hey  There's another galaxy. Oh  look  There's another galaxy. And for dollars  is their    million  plus the    million dollars from the American manufacturer. If this does not blow your mind  then you have no emotion. covering everything from basic arithmetic  all the way to vector calculus  and some of the stuff that you saw up there. We have a million students a month using the site  watching on the order of     to         videos a day. But what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level. But before I do that  I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started. And some of you all might know  about five years ago  I was an analyst at a hedge fund  and I was in Boston  and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans  remotely. And I started putting the first YouTube videos up  really just as a kind of nice to have  just kind of a supplement for my cousins  something that might give them a refresher or something. And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up  something interesting happened. Actually  a bunch of interesting things happened. The first was the feedback from my cousins. They told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person. And once you get over the backhanded nature of that  there was actually something very profound there. They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin. At first it's very unintuitive  but when you think about it from their point of view  it makes a ton of sense. You have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin  without feeling like they're wasting my time. If they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago  or maybe a couple of years ago  they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin. They can just watch those videos  if they're bored  they can go ahead. They can watch at their own time and pace. Probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around a new concept  the very last thing you need is another human being saying   Do you understand this   And that's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before  and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room. The other thing that happened is    I put them on YouTube just    I saw no reason to make it private  so I let other people watch it  and then people started stumbling on it  and I started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people around the world. These are just a few. This is actually from one of the original calculus videos. Someone wrote it on YouTube  it was a YouTube comment   First time I smiled doing a derivative.  Let's pause here. This person did a derivative  and then they smiled. In response to that same comment    this is on the thread  you can go on YouTube and look at the comments    someone else wrote   Same thing here. I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day  since I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class  and here I'm all like  'I know kung fu.'  We get a lot of feedback along those lines. This clearly was helping people. But then  as the viewership kept growing and kept growing  I started getting letters from people  and it was starting to become clear that it was more than just a nice to have. This is just an excerpt from one of those letters   My    year old son has autism  and has had a terrible time with math. We have tried everything  viewed everything  bought everything. We stumbled on your video on decimals  and it got through. Then we went on to the dreaded fractions. Again  he got it. We could not believe it. He is so excited.  And so you can imagine  here I was  an analyst at a hedge fund    it was very strange for me to do something of social value. But I was excited  so I kept going. And then a few other things started to dawn on me  that not only would it help my cousins right now  or these people who were sending letters  but that this content will never grow old  that it could help their kids or their grandkids. If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus  I wouldn't have to. Assuming he was good. We don't know. The other thing that happened    and even at this point  I said   OK  maybe it's a good supplement. It's good for motivated students. It's good for maybe home schoolers.  But I didn't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom. Then I started getting letters from teachers  and the teachers would write  saying   We've used your videos to flip the classroom. You've given the lectures  so now what we do     And this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow     what I do is I assign the lectures for homework  and what used to be homework  I now have the students doing in the classroom.  And I want to pause here    I want to pause here  because there's a couple of interesting things. One  when those teachers are doing that  there's the obvious benefit    the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did  they can pause  repeat at their own pace  at their own time. But the more interesting thing    and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom    by removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom  and letting students have a self paced lecture at home  then when you go to the classroom  letting them do work  having the teacher walk around  having the peers actually be able to interact with each other  these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience       kids with their fingers on their lips  not allowed to interact with each other. A teacher  no matter how good  has to give this one size fits all lecture to    students    blank faces  slightly antagonistic    and now it's a human experience  now they're actually interacting with each other. So once the Khan Academy    I quit my job  and we turned into a real organization    we're a not for profit    the question is  how do we take this to the next level  How do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion  And so  what I'm showing over here  these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins. The ones I started were much more primitive. This is a more competent version of it. But the paradigm here is  we'll generate as many questions as you need  until you get that concept  until you get    in a row. And the Khan Academy videos are there. You get hints  the actual steps for that problem  if you don't know how to do it. The paradigm here seems like a very simple thing     in a row  you move on. But it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right now. In a traditional classroom  you have homework  lecture  homework  lecture  and then you have a snapshot exam. And that exam  whether you get a    percent  an    percent  a    percent or a    percent  the class moves on to the next topic. And even that    percent student    what was the five percent they didn't know  Maybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zeroth power. Then you build on that in the next concept. That's analogous to    imagine learning to ride a bicycle. Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time  and I give you a bicycle for two weeks  then I come back after two weeks  and say   Well  let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns. You can't quite stop. You're an    percent bicyclist.  So I put a big  C  stamp on your forehead    and then I say   Here's a unicycle.  But as ridiculous as that sounds  that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now. And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden  and start failing calculus all of the sudden  despite being smart  despite having good teachers  and it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation. So our model is  learn math the way you'd learn anything  like riding a bicycle. Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle. Do it as long as necessary  until you have mastery. The traditional model  it penalizes you for experimentation and failure  but it does not expect mastery. We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to fail. But we do expect mastery. This is just another one of the modules. This is trigonometry. This is shifting and reflecting functions. And they all fit together. We have about    of these right now. You can go to the site right now  it's all free  not trying to sell anything. But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map. That top node right there  that's literally single digit addition  it's like one plus one is equal to two. The paradigm is  once you get    in a row on that  it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules. Further down the knowledge map  we're getting into more advanced arithmetic. Further down  you start getting into pre algebra and early algebra. Further down  you start getting into algebra one  algebra two  a little bit of precalculus. And the idea is  from this we can actually teach everything    well  everything that can be taught in this type of a framework. So you can imagine    and this is what we are working on    from this knowledge map  you have logic  you have computer programming  you have grammar  you have genetics  all based off of that core of  if you know this and that  now you're ready for this next concept. Now that can work well for an individual learner  and I encourage you to do it with your kids  but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself. It'll change what happens at the dinner table. But what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about. And so what I'm showing you here  this is data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district  where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes  and completely gutted their old math curriculum. These kids aren't using textbooks  or getting one size fits all lectures. They're doing Khan Academy  that software  for roughly half of their math class. I want to be clear  we don't view this as a complete math education. What it does is    this is what's happening in Los Altos    it frees up time    it's the blocking and tackling  making sure you know how to move through a system of equations  and it frees up time for the simulations  for the games  for the mechanics  for the robot building  for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow. And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day  every kid works at their own pace    this is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district    and they look at this dashboard. Every row is a student. Every column is one of those concepts. Green means the student's already proficient. Blue means they're working on it    no need to worry. Red means they're stuck. And what the teacher does is literally just say   Let me intervene on the red kids.  Or even better   Let me get one of the green kids  who are already proficient in that concept  to be the first line of attack  and actually tutor their peer.  Now  I come from a very data centric reality  so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions   What don't you understand  What do you understand   and all the rest. So our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible    data that  in any other field  is expected  in finance  marketing  manufacturing    so the teachers can diagnose what's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible. Now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to  how long they've spent each day  what videos they've watched  when did they pause the videos  what did they stop watching  what exercises are they using  what have they focused on  The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on. The inner circle shows the videos they're focused on. The data gets pretty granular  so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong. Red is wrong  blue is right. The leftmost question is the first one the student attempted. They watched the video over there. And you can see  eventually they were able to get    in a row. It's almost like you can see them learning over those last    problems. They also got faster    the height is how long it took them. When you talk about self paced learning  it makes sense for everyone    in education speak   differentiated learning     but it's kind of crazy  what happens when you see it in a classroom. Because every time we've done this  in every classroom we've done  over and over again  if you go five days into it  there's a group of kids who've raced ahead and a group who are a little bit slower. In a traditional model  in a snapshot assessment  you say   These are the gifted kids  these are the slow kids. Maybe they should be tracked differently. Maybe we should put them in different classes.  But when you let students work at their own pace    we see it over and over again    you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other  but once they get through that concept  they just race ahead. And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago  you now would think are gifted. And we're seeing it over and over again. It makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time. Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos  our goal is to use technology to humanize  not just in Los Altos  but on a global scale  what's happening in education. And that brings up an interesting point. A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios. In our mind  the relevant metric is  student to valuable human time  with the teacher ratio. So in a traditional model  most of the teacher's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot. Maybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students and working with them. Now      percent of their time is. So once again  using technology  not just flipping the classroom  you're humanizing the classroom  I'd argue  by a factor of five or   . As valuable as that is in Los Altos  imagine what it does to the adult learner  who's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff they should have known before going back to college. Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta  who has to help his family during the day  and that's the reason he or she can't go to school. Now they can spend two hours a day and remediate  or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don't know. Now imagine what happens where    we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom. But this is all one system. There's no reason why you can't have that peer to peer tutoring beyond that one classroom. Imagine what happens if that student in Calcutta all of the sudden can tutor your son  or your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta. And I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one world classroom. And that's essentially what we're trying to build. Thank you. Bill Gates  I'll ask about two or three questions. Salman Khan  Oh  OK. BG  I've seen some things you're doing in the system  that have to do with motivation and feedback    energy points  merit badges. Tell me what you're thinking there. SK  Oh yeah. No  we have an awesome team working on it. I have to be clear  it's not just me anymore. I'm still doing all the videos  but we have a rock star team doing the software. We've put a bunch of game mechanics in there  where you get badges  we're going to start having leader boards by area  you get points. It's actually been pretty interesting. Just the wording of the badging  or how many points you get for doing something  we see on a system wide basis  like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another  depending what badge you give them. BG  And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos  how did that come about  SK  Los Altos  it was kind of crazy. Once again  I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms. Someone from their board came and said   What would you do if you had carte Blanche in a classroom   I said   Well  every student would work at their own pace  on something like this  we'd give a dashboard.  They said   This is kind of radical. We have to think about it.  Me and the rest of the team were like   They're never going to want to do this.  But literally the next day they were like   Can you start in two weeks   BG  So fifth grade math is where that's going on right now  SK  It's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes. They're doing it at the district level. I think what they're excited about is they can follow these kids  not only in school  on Christmas  we saw some of the kids were doing it. We can track everything  track them as they go through the entire district. Through the summers  as they go from one teacher to the next  you have this continuity of data that even at the district level  they can see. BG  So some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those kids. So you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need  SK  Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers. We made some of those for students so they could see their data  but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves. And they're saying   Hey  this is nice  but     Like that focus graph  a lot of the teachers said   I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic.  So we made that focus diagram. So it's all been teacher driven. It's been pretty crazy. BG  Is this ready for prime time  Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out  SK  Yeah  it's ready. We've got a million people on the site already  so we can handle a few more. No  no reason why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow. BG  And the vision of the tutoring thing. The idea there is  if I'm confused about a topic  somehow right in the user interface  I'd find people who are volunteering  maybe see their reputation  and I could schedule and connect up with those people  SK  Absolutely. And this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do. Those dashboards the teachers have  you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids  your nephews  your cousins  or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club. And yeah  you can start becoming a mentor  a tutor  really immediately. But yeah  it's all there. BG  Well  it's amazing. I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education. BG  Thank you. SK  Thank you. Imagine if you could record your life    everything you said  everything you did  available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips  so you could go back and find memorable moments and relive them  or sift through traces of time and discover patterns in your own life that previously had gone undiscovered. Well that's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago. This is my wife and collaborator  Rupal. And on this day  at this moment  we walked into the house with our first child  our beautiful baby boy. And we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system. Deb Roy  This moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house  if you looked up  you'd see a camera and a microphone  and if you looked down  you'd get this bird's eye view of the room. Here's our living room  the baby bedroom  kitchen  dining room and the rest of the house. And all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture. So here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening and  finally  lights out for the day. Over the course of three years  we recorded eight to    hours a day  amassing roughly a quarter million hours of multi track audio and video. So you're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made. And what this data represents for our family at a personal level  the impact has already been immense  and we're still learning its value. Countless moments of unsolicited natural moments  not posed moments  are captured there  and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them. But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project  which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language    that child being my son. And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data  we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set  trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition. So we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do. This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen  and as we move through space and through time  a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen. In order to convert this opaque         hours of video into something that we could start to see  we use motion analysis to pull out  as we move through space and through time  what we call space time worms. And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data  and with it  trace the pattern of  in particular  where my son moved throughout the home  so that we could focus our transcription efforts  all of the speech environment around my son    all of the words that he heard from myself  my wife  our nanny  and over time  the words he began to produce. So with that technology and that data and the ability to  with machine assistance  transcribe speech  we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts. And with that  let me take you now for a first tour into the data. So you've all  I'm sure  seen time lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time. I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form. My son  soon after his first birthday  would say  gaga  to mean water. And over the course of the next half year  he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form   water.  So we're going to cruise through half a year in about    seconds. No video here  so you can focus on the sound  the acoustics  of a new kind of trajectory  gaga to water. Gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water. DR  He sure nailed it  didn't he. So he didn't just learn water. Over the course of the    months  the first two years that we really focused on  this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order. And because we have full transcripts  we've identified each of the     words that he learned to produce by his second birthday. He was an early talker. And so we started to analyze why. Why were certain words born before others  This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us. The way to interpret this apparently simple graph is  on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances. And the  horizontal  axis is time. And all of the data  we aligned based on the following idea  Every time my son would learn a word  we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word. And we would plot the relative length of the utterances. And what we found was this curious phenomena  that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum  making language as simple as possible  and then slowly ascend back up in complexity. And the amazing thing was that bounce  that dip  lined up almost precisely with when each word was born    word after word  systematically. So it appears that all three primary caregivers    myself  my wife and our nanny    were systematically and  I would think  subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language. And the implications of this    there are many  but one I just want to point out  is that there must be amazing feedback loops. Of course  my son is learning from his linguistic environment  but the environment is learning from him. That environment  people  are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now. But that's looking at the speech context. What about the visual context  We're not looking at    think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house. We've taken those circular fish eye lens cameras  and we've done some optical correction  and then we can bring it into three dimensional life. So welcome to my home. This is a moment  one moment captured across multiple cameras. The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine  where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe video life into this system. What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of    minutes  again  of just life in the living room. That's me and my son on the floor. And there's video analytics that are tracking our movements. My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink. We're now on the couch  looking out through the window at cars passing by. And finally  my son playing in a walking toy by himself. Now we freeze the action     minutes  we turn time into the vertical axis  and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we've just left behind. And we see these amazing structures    these little knots of two colors of thread we call  social hot spots.  The spiral thread we call a  solo hot spot.  And we think that these affect the way language is learned. What we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned    so in other words  the relationship between words and what they're about in the world. So here's how we're approaching this. In this video  again  my son is being traced out. He's leaving red ink behind. And there's our nanny by the door. Nanny  All right.  Baby  Aaaa.  DR  She offers water  and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water. And what we've done is use the word  water  to tag that moment  that bit of activity. And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in  and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co occurred with an instance of water. And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape. We call these wordscapes. This is the wordscape for the word water  and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen. That's where those big peaks are over to the left. And just for contrast  we can do this with any word. We can take the word  bye  as in  good bye.  And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house. And we look  and we find  as you would expect  a contrast in the landscape where the word  bye  occurs much more in a structured way. So we're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition  and that's ongoing work now. In my lab  which we're peering into now  at MIT    this is at the media lab. This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space. Three of the key people in this project  Philip DeCamp  Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here. Philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you're seeing. And Michael Fleischman was another Ph.D. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis  and he made the following observation  that  just the way that we're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language  that same idea we can take out of your home  Deb  and we can apply it to the world of public media.  And so our effort took an unexpected turn. Think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place. We've started analyzing television content using the same principles    analyzing event structure of a TV signal    episodes of shows  commercials  all of the components that make up the event structure. And we're now  with satellite dishes  pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States. And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people's conversations  you just tune into publicly available social media feeds. So we're pulling in about three billion comments a month  and then the magic happens. You have the event structure  the common ground that the words are about  coming out of the television feeds  you've got the conversations that are about those topics  and through semantic analysis    and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing    each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal. And the same idea now can be built up. And we get this wordscape  except now words are not assembled in my living room. Instead  the context  the common ground activities  are the content on television that's driving the conversations. And what we're seeing here  these skyscrapers now  are commentary that are linked to content on television. Same concept  but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere. And so fundamentally  rather than  for example  measuring content based on how many people are watching  this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content. And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family  we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people. This is a subset of data from our database    just        out of several million    and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources. And if you put them on one plain  a second plain is where the content lives. So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials  and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph. And then the important third dimension. Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content. And there are  again  now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content. And we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways. So if we  for example  trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it  and then we follow where that comment goes  and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content  a very interesting structure becomes visible. We call this a co viewing clique  a virtual living room if you will. And there are fascinating dynamics at play. It's not one way. A piece of content  an event  causes someone to talk. They talk to other people. That drives tune in behavior back into mass media  and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior. Another example    very different    another actual person in our database    and we're finding at least hundreds  if not thousands  of these. We've given this person a name. This is a pro amateur  or pro am media critic who has this high fan out rate. So a lot of people are following this person    very influential    and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV. So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together. One last example from this data  Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special. So if we go and look at this piece of content  President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago  and look at what we find in this same data set  at the same scale  the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable. A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on the broadcast. And of course  through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language. We can X ray and get a real time pulse of a nation  real time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content. So  to summarize  the idea is this  As our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they're saying it in  what's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen. It's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication. And I think the implications here are profound  whether it's for science  for commerce  for government  or perhaps most of all  for us as individuals. And so just to return to my son  when I was preparing this talk  he was looking over my shoulder  and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today  and I asked him for permission    granted. And then I went on to reflect   Isn't it amazing  this entire database  all these recordings  I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister     who arrived two years later     and you guys are going to be able to go back and re experience moments that you could never  with your biological memory  possibly remember the way you can now   And he was quiet for a moment. And I thought   What am I thinking  He's five years old. He's not going to understand this.  And just as I was having that thought  he looked up at me and said   So that when I grow up  I can show this to my kids   And I thought   Wow  this is powerful stuff.  So I want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family. This is the first time our son took more than two steps at once    captured on film. And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through. It's a cluttered environment  it's natural life. My mother's in the kitchen  cooking  and  of all places  in the hallway  I realize he's about to do it  about to take more than two steps. And so you hear me encouraging him  realizing what's happening  and then the magic happens. Listen very carefully. About three steps in  he realizes something magic is happening  and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in  and he takes a breath in  and he whispers  wow  and instinctively I echo back the same. And so let's fly back in time to that memorable moment. Come here. Can you do it  Oh  boy. Can you do it  Baby  Yeah. DR  Ma  he's walking. DR  Thank you. This is a river. This is a stream. This is a river. This is happening all over the country. There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States. On this map  the colored areas represent water conflicts. Similar problems are emerging in the east as well. The reasons vary state to state  but mostly in the details. There are       miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone. They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife. They're the veins of the ecosystem  and they're often empty veins. I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story. This is Prickly Pear Creek. It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena. It supports wild fish including cutthroat  brown and rainbow trout. Nearly every year for more than a hundred years  it's looked like this in the summer. How did we get here  Well  it started back in the late     s when people started settling in places like Montana. In short  there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people. But as more people showed up wanting water  the folks who were there first got a little concerned  and in       Montana passed its first water law. It basically said  everybody near the stream can share in the stream. Oddly  a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream  and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers. There were precedent setting suits in      and       both involving Prickly Pear Creek. And in       the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first  or  senior water rights.  These senior water rights are key. The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this. Some of these creeks have claims for    to     times more water than is actually in the stream. And the senior water rights holders  if they don't use their water right  they risk losing their water right  along with the economic value that goes with it. So they have no incentive to conserve. So it's not just about the number of people  the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it. So after decades of lawsuits and     years  now  of experience  we still have this. It's a broken system. There's a disincentive to conserve  because  if you don't use your water right  you can lose your water right. And I'm sure you all know  this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities. Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here. Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free  and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer. There's another thing happening around the country  which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint. They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water  they're trying to be really efficient with their water use  and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand. Well  it's a national problem  but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana  and it involves beer. I bet you didn't know  it takes about   pints of water to make a pint of beer. If you include all the drain  it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer. Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption  but they still use millions of gallons of water. I mean  there's water in beer. So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem  These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers. After all  there's a strong correlation between water and fishing  and for some  there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer. So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned  and they're looking for some way to address the problem. So how can they address this remaining water footprint  Remember Prickly Pear. Up until now  business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing  and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore. Remember Prickly Pear. It's a broken system. You've got a disincentive to conserve  because if you don't use your water right  you risk losing your water right. Well  we decided to connect these two worlds    the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks. In some states  senior water rights holders can leave their water in stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right. After all  it is their water right  and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream  it's their right to do so. But they have no incentive to do so. So  working with local water trusts  we created an incentive to do so. We pay them to leave their water in stream. That's what's happening here. This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion  leaving the water in the stream. He doesn't lose the water right  he just chooses to apply that right  or some portion of it  to the stream  instead of to the land. Because he's the senior water rights holder  he can protect the water from other users in the stream. Okay  He gets paid to leave the water in the stream. This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream. We then take the measured water  we divide it into thousand gallon increments. Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate  and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems. The brewers pay to restore water to the stream. It provides a simple  inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems  while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them. After     years of conflict and     years of dry streams  a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved  we put together a market based  willing buyer  willing seller solution    a solution that does not require litigation. It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed  into these degraded ecosystems  while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used. These transactions create allies  not enemies. They connect people rather than dividing them. And they provide needed economic support for rural communities. And most importantly  it's working. We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems. We've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in Montana  with hotels and tea companies in Oregon and with high tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest. And when we make these connections  we can and we do turn this into this. Thank you very much. When I got my current job  I was given a good piece of advice  which was to interview three politicians every day. And from that much contact with politicians  I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another. They have what I called  logorrhea dementia   which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. But what they do have is incredible social skills. When you meet them  they lock into you  they look you in the eye  they invade your personal space  they massage the back of your head. I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal    squeezing it. I once    this was years ago    I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate. And they were friends  and they hugged each other and they were laughing  and their faces were like this far apart. And they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other. And I was like   Get a room. I don't want to see this.  But they have those social skills. Another case  Last election cycle  I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire  and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons  Bip  Chip  Rip  Zip  Lip and Dip. And he's going into a diner. And he goes into the diner  introduces himself to a family and says   What village are you from in New Hampshire   And then he describes the home he owned in their village. And so he goes around the room  and then as he's leaving the diner  he first names almost everybody he's just met. I was like   Okay  that's social skill.  But the paradox is  when a lot of these people slip into the policy making mode  that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants. So in the course of my career  I have covered a series of failures. We sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up  and what they really lacked was social trust. We invaded Iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities. We had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid. For    years  I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes    charters  private schools  vouchers    but we've had disappointing results year after year. And the fact is  people learn from people they love. And if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student  you're not talking about that reality. But that reality is expunged from our policy making process. And so that's led to a question for me  Why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy  And I came to the conclusion  this is a symptom of a larger problem. That  for centuries  we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that we're divided selves  that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions. And it's led to a view of human nature that we're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives  and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is. And it's produced a great amputation  a shallow view of human nature. We're really good at talking about material things  but we're really bad at talking about emotions. We're really good at talking about skills and safety and health  we're really bad at talking about character. Alasdair MacIntyre  the famous philosopher  said that   We have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue  honor  goodness  but we no longer have a system by which to connect them.  And so this has led to a shallow path in politics  but also in a whole range of human endeavors. You can see it in the way we raise our young kids. You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out  and they're wearing these    pound backpacks. If the wind blows them over  they're like beetles stuck there on the ground. You see these cars that drive up    usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos  because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car  so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy    that's fine. They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms  who are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard. And you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children. So at the moment of conception  they're doing little butt exercises. Babies flop out  they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things. Driving them home  and they want them to be enlightened  so they take them to Ben   Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy. In one of my books  I joke that Ben   Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste    doesn't kill germs  just asks them to leave. It would be a big seller. And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula  and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International. They buy these seaweed based snacks there called Veggie Booty with Kale  which is for kids who come home and say   Mom  mom  I want a snack that'll help prevent colon rectal cancer.  And so the kids are raised in a certain way  jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure    SAT prep  oboe  soccer practice. They get into competitive colleges  they get good jobs  and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner  and they make a ton of money. And sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen. And they've become elegant and slender    they don't really have thighs  they just have one elegant calve on top of another. They have kids of their own  and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people  so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein  their daughters looks like Halle Berry    I don't know how they've done that. They get there and they realize it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights. So they've got these furry     pound dogs    all look like velociraptors  all named after Jane Austen characters. And then when they get old  they haven't really developed a philosophy of life  but they've decided   I've been successful at everything  I'm just not going to die.  And so they hire personal trainers  they're popping Cialis like breath mints. You see them on the mountains up there. They're cross country skiing up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis. And as they whiz by you  it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet going up the hill. And so this is part of what life is  but it's not all of what life is. And over the past few years  I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are. And it's not based on theology or philosophy  it's in the study of the mind  across all these spheres of research  from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists  behavioral economists  psychologists  sociology  we're developing a revolution in consciousness. And when you synthesize it all  it's giving us a new view of human nature. And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature  it's a new humanism  it's a new enchantment. And I think when you synthesize this research  you start with three key insights. The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species  the unconscious mind does most of the work. And so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute  of which it can be consciously aware of about   . And this leads to oddities. One of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists  people named Lawrence become lawyers  because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar  which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks. Another finding is that the unconscious  far from being dumb and sexualized  is actually quite smart. So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture. It's really hard to imagine a sofa  how it's going to look in your house. And the way you should do that is study the furniture  let it marinate in your mind  distract yourself  and then a few days later  go with your gut  because unconsciously you've figured it out. The second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking. People with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart  they're actually sometimes quite helpless. And the  giant  in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning    Antonio Damasio. And one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason  but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value. And so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom. Now I'm a middle aged guy. I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions. One of my favorite brain stories described these middle aged guys. They put them into a brain scan machine    this is apocryphal by the way  but I don't care    and they had them watch a horror movie  and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives. And the brain scans were identical in both activities. It was just sheer terror. So me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony  but it is the central organizing process of the way we think. It tells us what to imprint. The brain is the record of the feelings of a life. And the third insight is that we're not primarily self contained individuals. We're social animals  not rational animals. We emerge out of relationships  and we are deeply interpenetrated  one with another. And so when we see another person  we reenact in our own minds what we see in their minds. When we watch a car chase in a movie  it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase. When we watch pornography  it's a little like having sex  though probably not as good. And we see this when lovers walk down the street  when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion  the deep interpenetration. And this revolution in who we are gives us a different way of seeing  I think  politics  a different way  most importantly  of seeing human capital. We are now children of the French Enlightenment. We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties. But I think this research shows that the British Enlightenment  or the Scottish Enlightenment  with David Hume  Adam Smith  actually had a better handle on who we are    that reason is often weak  our sentiments are strong  and our sentiments are often trustworthy. And this work corrects that bias in our culture  that dehumanizing bias. It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life. When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily    things like grades  SAT's  degrees  the number of years in schooling. What it really takes to do well  to lead a meaningful life  are things that are deeper  things we don't really even have words for. And so let me list just a couple of the things I think this research points us toward trying to understand. The first gift  or talent  is mindsight    the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer. Babies come with this ability. Meltzoff  who's at the University of Washington  leaned over a baby who was    minutes old. He wagged his tongue at the baby. The baby wagged her tongue back. Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind and to download what they find    their models of how to understand reality. In the United States     percent of babies have a deep two way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people. And those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life. Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict with    percent accuracy  at age    months  who was going to graduate from high school  based on who had good attachment with mom. Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships. They are what we call avoidantly attached. They have trouble relating to other people. They go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind    wanting to get close to people  but not really having the models of how to do that. And so this is one skill of how to hoover up knowledge  one from another. A second skill is equipoise  the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind. So for example  we are overconfidence machines. Ninety five percent of our professors report that they are above average teachers. Ninety six percent of college students say they have above average social skills. Time magazine asked Americans   Are you in the top one percent of earners   Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners. This is a gender linked trait  by the way. Men drown at twice the rate of women  because men think they can swim across that lake. But some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases  their own overconfidence. They have epistemological modesty. They are open minded in the face of ambiguity. They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence. They are curious. And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ. The third trait is metis  what we might call street smarts    it's a Greek word. It's a sensitivity to the physical environment  the ability to pick out patterns in an environment    derive a gist. One of my colleagues at the Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an IED  a landmine  in the street. They couldn't tell you how they did it  but they could feel cold  they felt a coldness  and they were more often right than wrong. The third is what you might call sympathy  the ability to work within groups. And that comes in tremendously handy  because groups are smarter than individuals. And face to face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically  because    percent of our communication is non verbal. And the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group  it's determined by how well they communicate  how often they take turns in conversation. Then you could talk about a trait like blending. Any child can say   I'm a tiger   pretend to be a tiger. It seems so elementary. But in fact  it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept  I  and a concept  tiger  and blend them together. But this is the source of innovation. What Picasso did  for example  was take the concept  Western art  and the concept  African masks  and blend them together    not only the geometry  but the moral systems entailed in them. And these are skills  again  we can't count and measure. And then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence. And this is not an ability  it's a drive and a motivation. The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige. The unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence  when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task    when a craftsman feels lost in his craft  when a naturalist feels at one with nature  when a believer feels at one with God's love. That is what the unconscious mind hungers for. And many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused. And one of the most beautiful descriptions I've come across in this research of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana. He was married to a woman named Carol  and they had a wonderful relationship. When their kids were five and two  Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly. And Hofstadter wrote a book called  I Am a Strange Loop.  In the course of that book  he describes a moment    just months after Carol has died    he comes across her picture on the mantel  or on a bureau in his bedroom. And here's what he wrote   I looked at her face  and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes. And all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed  'That's me. That's me.' And those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before  about the fusion of our souls into one higher level entity  about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children  about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes  but were just one hope  one clear thing that defined us both  that welded us into a unit    the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children. I realized that  though Carol had died  that core piece of her had not died at all  but had lived on very determinedly in my brain.  The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom. Through his suffering  Hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are. Through the policy failures of the last    years  we have come to acknowledge  I think  how shallow our view of human nature has been. And now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are  comes this revolution in consciousness    these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted  this new humanism. And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious  it had a vast effect on the climate of the times. Now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious  of who we are deep inside  and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture. Thank you. I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that  by far  most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light. We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes. The Sun burns our peripheral vision. We see light reflected off the Moon. And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies  the known universe has come to us through light  across vast eras in cosmic history. And with all of our modern telescopes  we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe    these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang. And yet  the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent. I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself  because space can wobble like a drum. It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold. Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe    a sonic composition. And while we've never heard the sounds from space  we really should  in the next few years  start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there. So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe  we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have  because black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song  which I'd like to play for you    some of our predictions for what that song will be like. Now black holes are dark against a dark sky. We can't see them directly. They're not brought to us with light  at least not directly. We can see them indirectly  because black holes wreak havoc on their environment. They destroy stars around them. They churn up debris in their surroundings. But they won't come to us directly through light. We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background  but we haven't yet. And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen  and that's because they bang on space time like a drum. Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein    to whom we owe so much. Einstein realized that if space were empty  if the universe were empty  it would be like this picture  except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it. But if we were freely falling through the space  even without this helpful grid  we might be able to paint it ourselves  because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines  undeflected straight paths through the universe. Einstein also realized    and this is the real meat of the matter    that if you put energy or mass in the universe  it would curve space  and a freely falling object would pass by  let's say  the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space. It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity. Now even light will be bent by those paths. And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun  as the Earth is  or the Moon around the Earth. These are the natural curves in space. What Einstein did not realize was that  if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers    so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across  you would make a black hole  an object so dense that if light veered too close  it would never escape    a dark shadow against the universe. It wasn't Einstein who realized this  it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I    joined the German army already an accomplished scientist  working on the Russian front. I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire  and then  in between  calculating Einstein's equations    as you do in the trenches. And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity  and he was thrilled by this theory. And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary  curves so strong that space would rain down into them  space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole. And even light could not escape this current. Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be  and all that would be left would be a shadow. Now he wrote to Einstein  and he said   As you will see  the war has been kind to me enough. Despite the heavy gunfire  I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas.  And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution  and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist. This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions. And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week. But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity. He did not believe they existed in nature. He thought nature would protect us from their formation. It was decades before the term  black hole  was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects    in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime. Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole. It's actually not massive enough. But if we did a little thought experiment    as Einstein was very fond of doing    we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers  and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit  maybe    kilometers outside of the black hole sun. And it would be self illuminated  because now the Sun's gone  we have no other source of light    so let's make our little Earth self illuminated. And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even    km outside of this crushed black hole. This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan  more or less. It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth. But basically that's what we're talking about. We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan. So we move this Earth very close       kilometers outside    and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole. There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe  but you actually have to get very close to fall in. But what's very impressive is that  from our vantage point  we can always see the Earth. It cannot hide behind the black hole. The light from the Earth  some of it falls in  but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us. So you can't hide anything behind a black hole. If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons  don't hide behind the black hole. They can see you. Now  our Sun will not collapse to a black hole    it's not massive enough    but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy. And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way  this is what it would look like. We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes. And if we were to fall towards this black hole  we would see all of that light lensed around it  and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened. It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't  anymore than light can escape. But even though the black hole is dark from the outside  it's not dark on the inside  because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us. And even though  due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation  our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time  it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us  right before we were crushed to death by the black hole. It would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel  but it's a total death experience. And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel. Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole  but black holes can be heard  even if they're not seen. Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation    imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together. Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes    each one    times the mass of the Sun. So now we're going to crush them down to    kilometers across. They can be spinning hundreds of times a second. At the end of their lives  they're going around each other very near the speed of light. So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second  and as they do so  they not only curve space  but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space  an actual wave on space time. Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe. And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light. This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard. It took almost    years for anyone in the world to crack this problem. This was one of the groups. It shows two black holes in orbit around each other  again  with these helpfully painted curves. And if you can see    it's kind of faint    but if you can see the red waves emanating out  those are the gravitational waves. They're literally the sounds of space ringing  and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning  quiet black hole at the end of the day. If you were standing near enough  your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space. You would literally hear the sound. Now of course  your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully  so you might have trouble understanding what's going on. But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict. This is from my group    a slightly less glamorous computer modeling. Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close. If it gets far away  it's a little too quiet. But it comes in like a mallet  and it literally cracks space  wobbling it like a drum. And we can predict what the sound will be. We know that  as it falls in  it gets faster and it gets louder. And eventually  we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. Then it's gone. Now I've never heard it that loud    it's actually more dramatic. At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic. It's sort of like ding  ding  ding. This is another sound from my group. No  I'm not showing you any images  because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink  and space is not painted  showing you the curves. But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this  you want to get moving. Want to get away from the sound. Both black holes are moving. Both black holes are getting closer together. In this case  they're both wobbling quite a lot. And then they're going to merge. Now it's gone. Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging    that it chirps up at the end. Now that's our prediction for what we'll see. Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach  California. And surely  somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged. And surely  the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years  or a million years  at the speed of light to get to us. But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear. There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth    one called LIGO    which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers. It's a remarkably ambitious experiment  and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years    to pick this up. There's also a mission proposed for space  which hopefully will launch in the next ten years  called LISA. And LISA will be able to see super massive black holes    black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun. In this Hubble image  we see two galaxies. They look like they're frozen in some embrace. And each one probably harbors a super massive black hole at its core. But they're not frozen  they're actually merging. These two black holes are colliding  and they will merge over a billion year time scale. It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration. But LISA could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history  the last    minutes before they fall together. And it's not just black holes  but it's also any big disturbance in the universe    and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang. When that expression was coined  it was derisive    like   Oh  who would believe in a Big Bang   But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang. It might make a sound. This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside. We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe. So imagine you're inside the Big Bang. It's everywhere  it's all around you  and the space is wobbling chaotically. Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us. Galaxies form  and generations of stars form in those galaxies  and around one star  at least one star  is a habitable planet. And here we are frantically building these experiments  doing these calculations  writing these computer codes. Imagine a billion years ago  two black holes collided. That song has been ringing through space for all that time. We weren't even here. It gets closer and closer           years ago  we're still doing cave paintings. It's like hurry  build your instruments. It's getting closer and closer  and in    ... whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity    we'll build them  we'll turn on the machines and  bang  we'll catch it    the first song from space. If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up  it would sound like this. It's literally the definition of noise. It's white noise  it's such a chaotic ringing. But it's around us everywhere  presumably  if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe. And if we pick it up  it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation  of our observable universe. So within the next few years  we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit  render the universe in audio. But if we detect those earliest moments  it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang  which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest  most elusive  questions. If we run the movie of our universe backwards  we know that there was a Big Bang in our past  and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it  but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang  I mean we have to ask  has it happened before  Will it happen again  I mean  in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder  we can ask questions  at least for this last minute  that honestly might evade us forever. But we have to ask  Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history  Or  is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse    each branch with its own Big Bang in its past    maybe some of them with black holes playing drums  maybe some without    maybe some with sentient life  and maybe some without    not in our past  not in our future  but somehow fundamentally connected to us  So we have to wonder  if there is a multiverse  in some other patch of that multiverse  are there creatures  Here's my multiverse creatures. Are there other creatures in the multiverse  wondering about us and wondering about their own origins  And if they are  I can imagine them as we are  calculating  writing computer code  building instruments  trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there. Thank you. Thank you. Back in New York  I am the head of development for a non profit called Robin Hood. When I'm not fighting poverty  I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. Now in our town  where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff  you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. I remember my first fire. I was the second volunteer on the scene  so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in. But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be. When I found the captain  he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner  who was surely having one of the worst days of her life. Here it was  the middle of the night  she was standing outside in the pouring rain  under an umbrella  in her pajamas  barefoot  while her house was in flames. The other volunteer who had arrived just before me    let's call him Lex Luther    got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog  I was stunned with jealousy. Here was some lawyer or money manager who  for the rest of his life  gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature  just because he beat me by five seconds. Well  I was next. The captain waved me over. He said   Bezos  I need you to go into the house. I need you to go upstairs  past the fire  and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes.  I swear. So  not exactly what I was hoping for  but off I went    up the stairs  down the hall  past the 'real' firefighters  who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point  into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. Now I know what you're thinking  but I'm no hero. I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door. We took our treasures outside to the homeowner  where  not surprisingly  his received much more attention than did mine. A few weeks later  the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home. The act of kindness she noted above all others  someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter  I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale  but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis. And you know what I've learned  They all matter. So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved  or are on their way to achieving  remarkable levels of success  I would offer this reminder  don't wait. Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life. If you have something to give  give it now. Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. Be a mentor. Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life  but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. So get in the game. Save the shoes. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Mark  Mark  come back. Mark Bezos  Thank you. There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says   Light creates ambiance  light makes the feel of a space  and light is also the expression of structure.  Well  that was not by me. That was  of course  by Le Corbusier  the famous architect. And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings    the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut De Ronchamp    where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark. And I think that is the quintessence of this    minute talk    that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well being without proper darkness. So this is how we normally would light our offices. We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much Lux and of great uniformity. This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps. And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier. If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome  it would never have looked like this  because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building. And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said   Light  I make it in my buildings for comfort.  And he didn't mean the comfort of a five course dinner as opposed to a one course meal  but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people. He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun. And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky  and where you can experience the sun  that give us a better life in the built environment  just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows. And what it all boils down to is  of course  the sun. And this image of the Sun may suggest that the Sun is something evil and aggressive  but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the Sun  and light is only a manifestation of that energy. The sun is for dynamics  for color changes. The sun is for beauty in our environment  like in this building    the High Museum in Atlanta  which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy  together with Arup Lighting  a brilliant team of lighting designers  who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space  responding to what the sun does outside  just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof. So in an indirect way  you can see the sun. And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum. They created this shade that you can see here  which actually covers the sun  but opens up to the good light from the sky. And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models  with quantitative as well as qualitative methods  to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture. They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way. As you can see here  there's some direct light on the floor  but they could easily figure out where that comes from. And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun  the good part of the sun. And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways  of course. It can be just like this  or maybe like this  which is rather peculiar  but this is in         the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States. And it's just a bit bright up there  so these people have found a very intriguing solution. This is  I think  a very illustrative image of what I try to say    that the beautiful dynamics of sun  bringing these into the building  creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives. And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness  of course  because otherwise you don't see these dynamics. As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk  this is a well known office  which is the Weidt Group. They are in green energy consulting  or something like that. And they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all. It has only  on one side  this big  big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range. So it can be very dim over there  and you do your work  and it can be very bright over there  and you do your work. But actually  the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull  and therefore helps us to enhance our lives. I really owe a short introduction of this man to you. This is Richard Kelly who was born     years ago  which is the reason I bring him up now  because it's kind of an anniversary year. In the     s  Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design. And he coined three terms  which are  focal glow    ambient luminescence  and  play of the brilliants     three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience. So to begin with  focal glow. He meant something like this    where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around. Or something like this  which is the lighting design he did for General Motors  for the car showroom. And you enter that space  and you feel like   Wow  This is so impressive   just because of this focal point  this huge light source in the middle. To me  it is something from theater  and I will get back to that a little bit later. It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus. It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land  highlighting it compared to the dim environment. Or it can be in today's retail  in the shopping environment    lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around. Ambient luminescence is something very different. Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite  something without any focus  something where all details actually dissolve in infinity. And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate. It could also be something like this  the National Museum of Science in London  where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture. And then finally  Kelly's play of brilliants added to that really some play  I think  of the skyline of Hong Kong  or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house  or in the theater here  which is the decoration  the icing on the cake  something playful  something that is just an addition to the architectural environment  I would say. These three distinct elements  together  make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better. And we can only create these out of darkness. And I will explain that further. And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly  here on the left  was explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe. And behind them  you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design. Those times  there were some early attempts also for light therapy already. You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine  where people are put in the sun to get better. It's a little bit of a different story  this health aspect of light  than what I'm telling you today. In today's modern medicine  there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way. And there is the idea that  when we look at things  it is the yellow light that helps us the most  that we are the most sensitive for. But our circadian rhythms  which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on  they are much more triggered by blue light. And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment  we can help people to relax  or to be alert  to fall asleep  or to stay awake. And that is how  maybe in the near future  light can help hospitals to make people better sooner  recover them quicker. Maybe in the airplane  we can overcome jet lag like that. Perhaps in school  we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work. And you can imagine a lot more applications. But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life. So light is  of course  for social interaction also    to create relationships with all the features around us. It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other. And it is all about this planet. But when you look at this planet at night  it looks like this. And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today. Because all this light here goes up to the sky. It never reaches the ground where it was meant for. It never is to the benefit of people. It only spoils the darkness. So at a global scale  it looks like this. And  I mean  that is quite amazing  what you see here    how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground. Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be  it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything. The world is changing though  and urbanization is a big driver of everything. I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou  and I realized that    years ago  there was nothing like this  of these buildings. It was just a much smaller city  and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous. And we have to understand these main questions  How do people move through these new urban spaces  How do they share their culture  How do we tackle things like mobility  And how can light help there  Because the new technologies  they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments. It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps. And of course  we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that. Now we have LED  but here you see the latest one  and you see how incredibly small it is. And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity  because this tiny  tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it. And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness. So that is a really interesting proposition  I think  and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well being in mind. The problem is  though  that I wanted to explain to you how this really works    but I can have four of these on my finger  so you would not be able to really see them. So I asked our laboratory to do something about it  and they said   Well  we can do something.  They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam. So here it is. It's the same thing as you can see over there    just     times bigger. And I will very quickly show you how it works. So just to explain. Now  every LED that is made these days gives blue light. Now  this is not very pleasant and comfortable. And for that reason  we cover the LED with a phosphor cap. And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant. And then when you add the lens to that  you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else. So you can preserve the darkness and make the light. I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works. Thank you. We can go further. So we have to rethink the way we light our cities. We have to think again about light as a default solution. Why are all these motorways permanently lit  Is it really needed  Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness  Can we be much more gentle with light  Like here    this is a very low light level actually. Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create  so they really want to connect with it  like here  Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around  And can we preserve the darkness  Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very  very challenging. And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult. Even in the oceans  we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well being. And it's known that migrating birds  for example  get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms. And we discovered that when we make those lights green  the birds  they actually go the right way. They are not disturbed anymore. And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here. In all of these examples  I think  we should start making the light out of darkness  and use the darkness as a canvas    like the visual artists do  like Edward Hopper in this painting. I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting. I think  when I see it  I start to think  who are those people  Where have they come from  Where are they going  What just happened  What will be happening in the next five minutes  And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light. Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark. And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments. We can do that in commercial spaces like this. And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe  which is  of course  the universe itself. So I give you this wonderful  informative image of the sky  ranging from the inner city  where you may see one or two stars and nothing else  all the way to the rural environments  where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars. In architecture  it works just the same. By appreciating the darkness when you design the light  you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives. This is the most well known example  Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals  where light and dark  in very gentle combinations  alter each other to define the space. Or Richard MacCormac's Southwark tube station in London  where you can really see the sky  even though you are under the ground. And finally  I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater. And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks. It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater. And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light. Thank you very much. If I should have a daughter  instead of  Mom   she's going to call me  Point B   because that way she knows that no matter what happens  at least she can always find her way to me. And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say   Oh  I know that like the back of my hand.  And she's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face  wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt  here  that cannot be fixed by Band Aids or poetry. So the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming  I'll make sure she knows she doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself  because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers  your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. Believe me  I've tried.  And  baby   I'll tell her  don't keep your nose up in the air like that. I know that trick  I've done it a million times. You're just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house  so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place  to see if you can change him. But I know she will anyway  so instead I'll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby  because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix. Okay  there's a few that chocolate can't fix. But that's what the rain boots are for  because rain will wash away everything  if you let it. I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat  to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind  because that's the way my mom taught me. That there'll be days like this. When you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises  when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape  when your boots will fill with rain  and you'll be up to your knees in disappointment. And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you. Because there's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline  no matter how many times it's sent away. You will put the wind in win some  lose some. You will put the star in starting over  and over. And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute  be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life. And yes  on a scale from one to over trusting  I am pretty damn naive. But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. It can crumble so easily  but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.  Baby   I'll tell her   remember  your momma is a worrier  and your poppa is a warrior  and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.  Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things. Always apologize when you've done something wrong  but don't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining. Your voice is small  but don't ever stop singing. And when they finally hand you heartache  when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street corners of cynicism and defeat  you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. All right  so I want you to take a moment  and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true. They can be about whatever you want    technology  entertainment  design  your family  what you had for breakfast. The only rule is don't think too hard. Okay  ready  Go. Okay. So here are three things I know to be true. I know that Jean Luc Godard was right when he said that   A good story has a beginning  a middle and an end  although not necessarily in that order.  I know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here  which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool. And I know that I have been waiting all week to tell this joke. Why was the scarecrow invited to TED  Because he was out standing in his field. I'm sorry. Okay  so these are three things I know to be true. But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding. So I write poems to figure things out. Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem. Sometimes I get to the end of the poem  look back and go   Oh  that's what this is all about   and sometimes I get to the end of the poem and haven't solved anything  but at least I have a new poem out of it. Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry. I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper  that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person. When I was a freshman in high school  I was a live wire of nervous hormones. And I was underdeveloped and over excitable. And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long  I was fascinated by the idea of spoken word poetry. I felt that my two secret loves  poetry and theater  had come together  had a baby  a baby I needed to get to know. So I decided to give it a try. My first spoken word poem  packed with all the wisdom of a    year old  was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine. The poem was very indignant  and mainly exaggerated  but the only spoken word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant  so I thought that's what was expected of me. The first time that I performed  the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy  and when I came off the stage  I was shaking. I felt this tap on my shoulder  and I turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd. She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand  but instead she just nodded at me and said   Hey  I really felt that. Thanks.  And lightning struck. I was hooked. I discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic  and my bewildered  but supportive  parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could. I was the youngest by at least a decade  but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem bothered by the    year old wandering about. In fact  they welcomed me. And it was here  listening to these poets share their stories  that I learned that spoken word poetry didn't have to be indignant  it could be fun or painful or serious or silly. The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home  and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well. Never mind the fact that I was   . They told me   Write about being   .  So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant  grown up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me   Hey  I really felt that too.  Now I can divide my spoken word journey into three steps. Step one was the moment I said   I can. I can do this.  And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie. Step two was the moment I said   I will. I will continue. I love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week.  And step three began when I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems  if that's not what I was. There were things that were specific to me  and the more that I focused on those things  the weirder my poetry got  but the more that it felt like mine. It's not just the adage  Write what you know.  It's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience you've collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don't know. I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand  but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been. When I got to university  I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken word poetry. And actually  Phil Kaye and I coincidentally also share the same last name. When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E. as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me. But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E.  this time changing the mission to using spoken word poetry as a way to entertain  educate and inspire. We stayed full time students  but in between we traveled  performing and teaching nine year olds to MFA candidates  from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus. And we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks. But it turns out sometimes  poetry can be really scary. Turns out sometimes  you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry. So I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists. And the first list that I assign is     Things I Know to be True.  And here's what happens  you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud. At a certain point  you would realize that someone has the exact same thing  or one thing very similar  to something on your list. And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours. Third  someone has something you've never even heard of before. Fourth  someone has something you thought you knew everything about  but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it. And I tell people that this is where great stories start from    these four intersections of what you're passionate about and what others might be invested in. And most people respond really well to this exercise. But one of my students  a freshman named Charlotte  was not convinced. Charlotte was very good at writing lists  but she refused to write any poems.  Miss   she'd say   I'm just not interesting. I don't have anything interesting to say.  So I assigned her list after list  and one day I assigned the list     Things I Should Have Learned by Now.  Number three on Charlotte's list was   I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age.  I asked her what that meant  and she said   Miss  it's kind of a long story.  And I said   Charlotte  it sounds pretty interesting to me.  And so she wrote her first poem  a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before. And the poem began   Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man.   Did you see him on    Minutes  racing Michael Phelps in a pool    nothing but swim trunks on    diving in the water  determined to beat this swimming champion  After the race  he tossed his wet  cloud white hair and said  'You're a god.' No  Anderson  you're the god.  Now  I know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed  to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you. Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this. You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up. But I try to walk through life like this. And yes  that means catching all of those miseries and hurt  but it also means that when beautiful  amazing things just fall out of the sky  I'm ready to catch them. I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder  to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and  instead  actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them  so that they can reinterpret and create something from it. It's not that I think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form. I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story. I write musicals  I make short films alongside my poems. But I teach spoken word poetry because it's accessible. Not everyone can read music or owns a camera  but everyone can communicate in some way  and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from. Plus  spoken word poetry allows for immediate connection. It's not uncommon to feel like you're alone or that nobody understands you  but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions  you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers  or your community  who will listen. And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what you've shared. And that is an amazing realization to have  especially when you're   . Plus  now with YouTube  that connection's not even limited to the room we're in. I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students. It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to. Once you've figured this out  it is tempting to keep writing the same poem  or keep telling the same story  over and over  once you've figured out that it will gain you applause. It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself. You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself. And that is step three  infusing the work you're doing with the specific things that make you you  even while those things are always changing. Because step three never ends. But you don't get to start on step three  until you take step one first   I can.  I travel a lot while I'm teaching  and I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three  but I was very lucky with Charlotte  that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did. I watched her realize that  by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing  she can create poems that only Charlotte can write  about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer. And I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell    like this story. I spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story  and I wondered if the best way was going to be a PowerPoint  a short film    And where exactly was the beginning  the middle or the end  I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out  or not. And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club  but it's possible that it was much earlier. In preparing for TED  I discovered this diary page in an old journal. I think December   th was probably supposed to be   th. It's clear that when I was a child  I definitely walked through life like this. I think that we all did. I would like to help others rediscover that wonder    to want to engage with it  to want to learn  to want to share what they've learned  what they've figured out to be true and what they're still figuring out. So I'd like to close with this poem. When they bombed Hiroshima  the explosion formed a mini supernova  so every living animal  human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash. And what was left of the city soon followed. The long lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder. When I was born  my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said   This  I've done this before.  She says I have old eyes. When my Grandpa Genji died  I was only five years old  but I took my mom by the hand and told her   Don't worry  he'll come back as a baby.  And yet  for someone who's apparently done this already  I still haven't figured anything out yet. My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage. My self confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry  and it still always tastes funny in my mouth. But in Hiroshima  some people were wiped clean away  leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page. So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets  I keep trying  hoping that one day I'll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed. My parents named me Sarah  which is a biblical name. In the original story  God told Sarah she could do something impossible  and    she laughed  because the first Sarah  she didn't know what to do with impossible. And me  Well  neither do I  but I see the impossible every day. Impossible is trying to connect in this world  trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you  knowing that while you're speaking  they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk    they hear you. They feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it. It's what I strive for every time I open my mouth    that impossible connection. There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation. But on the front step  a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone. The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light. After the A bomb  specialists said it would take    years for the radiation damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again. But that spring  there were new buds popping up from the earth. When I meet you  in that moment  I'm no longer a part of your future. I start quickly becoming part of your past. But in that instant  I get to share your present. And you  you get to share mine. And that is the greatest present of all. So if you tell me I can do the impossible    I'll probably laugh at you. I don't know if I can change the world yet  because I don't know that much about it    and I don't know that much about reincarnation either  but if you make me laugh hard enough  sometimes I forget what century I'm in. This isn't my first time here. This isn't my last time here. These aren't the last words I'll share. But just in case  I'm trying my hardest to get it right this time around. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life. That was a great day for my mother. My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine  and the first day it was going to be used  even Grandma was invited to see the machine. And Grandma was even more excited. Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood  and she had hand washed laundry for seven children. And now she was going to watch electricity do that work. My mother carefully opened the door  and she loaded the laundry into the machine  like this. And then  when she closed the door  Grandma said   No  no  no  no. Let me  let me push the button.  And Grandma pushed the button  and she said   Oh  fantastic  I want to see this  Give me a chair  Give me a chair  I want to see it   and she sat down in front of the machine  and she watched the entire washing program. She was mesmerized. To my grandmother  the washing machine was a miracle. Today  in Sweden and other rich countries  people are using so many different machines. Look  the homes are full of machines. I can't even name them all. And they also  when they want to travel  they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations. And yet  in the world  there are so many people who still heat the water on fire  and they cook their food on fire. Sometimes they don't even have enough food  and they live below the poverty line. There are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day. And the richest people over there    there's one billion people    and they live above what I call the  air line   because they spend more than     a day on their consumption. But this is just one  two  three billion people  and obviously there are seven billion people in the world  so there must be one  two  three  four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line. They have electricity  but the question is  how many have washing machines  I've done the scrutiny of market data  and I've found that  indeed  the washing machine has penetrated below the air line  and today there's an additional one billion people out there who live above the  wash line.  And they consume more than     per day. So two billion have access to washing machines. And the remaining five billion  how do they wash  Or  to be more precise  how do most of the women in the world wash  Because it remains hard work for women to wash. They wash like this  by hand. It's a hard  time consuming labor  which they have to do for hours every week. And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home  or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off. And they want the washing machine. They don't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity. And there's nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma. Look here  two generations ago in Sweden    picking water from the stream  heating with firewood and washing like that. They want the washing machine in exactly the same way. But when I lecture to environmentally concerned students  they tell me   No  everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines.  How can we tell this woman that she ain't going to have a washing machine  And then I ask my students  I've asked them    over the last two years I've asked   How many of you doesn't use a car   And some of them proudly raise their hand and say   I don't use a car.  And then I put the really tough question   How many of you hand wash your jeans and your bed sheets   And no one raised their hand. Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines. So how come  this is  something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it  What is special with this  I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world. Here we are. Look here  you see the seven billion people up there  the air people  the wash people  the bulb people and the fire people. One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel    oil  coal or gas. That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is. And it's    units used in the entire world  and the richest one billion  they use six of them. Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population. And these ones who have washing machines  but not a house full of other machines  they use two. This group uses three  one each. And they also have electricity. And over there they don't even use one each. That makes    of them. But the main concern for the environmentally interested students    and they are right    is about the future. What are the trends  If we just prolong the trends  without any real advanced analysis  to       there are two things that can increase the energy use. First  population growth. Second  economic growth. Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman. And  with  that you will get two extra  but that won't change the energy use very much. What will happen is economic growth. The best of here in the emerging economies    I call them the New East    they will jump the air line.  Wopp   they will say. And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already. And these people  they want the washing machine. I told you. They'll go there. And they will double their energy use. And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light. And they'll get a two child family without a stop in population growth. But the total energy consumption will increase to    units. And these    units    still the richest people use most of it. So what needs to be done  Because the risk  the high probability of climate change is real. It's real. Of course they must be more energy efficient. They must change behavior in some way. They must also start to produce green energy  much more green energy. But until they have the same energy consumption per person  they shouldn't give advice to others    what to do and what not to do. Here we can get more green energy all over. This is what we hope may happen. It's a real challenge in the future. But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio  she wants a washing machine. She's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone    so happy that she even voted for her. And she became Dilma Rousseff  the president elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world    moving from minister of energy to president. If you have democracy  people will vote for washing machines. They love them. And what's the magic with them  My mother explained the magic with this machine the very  very first day. She said   Now Hans  we have loaded the laundry. The machine will make the work. And now we can go to the library.  Because this is the magic  you load the laundry  and what do you get out of the machine  You get books out of the machines  children's books. And mother got time to read for me. She loved this. I got the  ABC's     this is where I started my career as a professor  when my mother had time to read for me. And she also got books for herself. She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language. And she read so many novels  so many different novels here. And we really  we really loved this machine. And what we said  my mother and me   Thank you industrialization. Thank you steel mill. Thank you power station. And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books.  Thank you very much. I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival. It's a place where women run the show  have sex to say hello  and play rules the day    where fun is serious business. And no  this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco. Ladies and gentlemen  meet your cousins. This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo. Bonobos are  together with chimpanzees  your living closest relative. That means we all share a common ancestor  an evolutionary grandmother  who lived around six million years ago. Now  chimpanzees are well known for their aggression. But unfortunately  we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution. But bonobos show us the other side of the coin. While chimpanzees are dominated by big  scary guys  bonobo society is run by empowered females. These guys have really worked something out  since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet. But unfortunately  bonobos are the least understood of the great apes. They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle  and it has been very difficult to study them. The Congo is a paradox    a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty  but also the heart of darkness itself    the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War. Not surprisingly  this destruction also endangers bonobo survival. Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world    and we're not even sure of that to be honest. Yet  in this land of violence and chaos  you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees. Who are these cousins  We know them as the  make love  not war  apes since they have frequent  promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. Now  I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems    since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra. Bonobos  like humans  love to play throughout their entire lives. Play is not just child's games. For us and them  play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance. It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game. Play increases creativity and resilience  and it's all about the generation of diversity    diversity of interactions  diversity of behaviors  diversity of connections. And when you watch bonobo play  you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter  dance and ritual. Play is the glue that binds us together. Now  I don't know how you play  but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild. First  it's a ball game bonobo style    and I do not mean football. So here  we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game. Have a look what she's doing. It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase   she's got him by the balls.  Only I think that he's rather loving it here  right  Yeah. So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans. And this video is really interesting because it shows    this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play    such as testicles    and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust    while at the same time being tremendous fun. But play's a shapeshifter. Play's a shapeshifter  and it can take many forms  some of which are more quiet  imaginative  curious    maybe where wonder is discovered anew. And I want you to see  this is Fuku  a young female  and she is quietly playing with water. I think  like her  we sometimes play alone  and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds. And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore  drives us to interact  and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity. So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present. But they also hold a secret for our future  a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation. The secret is that play is the key to these capacities. In other words  play is our adaptive wildcard. In order to adapt successfully to a changing world  we need to play. But will we make the most of our playfulness  Play is not frivolous. Play's essential. For bonobos and humans alike  life is not just red in tooth and claw. In times when it seems least appropriate to play  it might be the times when it is most urgent. And so  my fellow primates  let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together  as we rediscover creativity  fellowship and wonder. Thank you. Today I want to talk about design  but not design as we usually think about it. I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific  biotechnological culture  where  for really the first time in history  we have the power to design bodies  to design animal bodies  to design human bodies. In the history of our planet  there have been three great waves of evolution. The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution. So  as you all know  species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments  and the pressures of those environments selected which changes  through random mutation in species  were going to be preserved. Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution  which was we changed the environment in which we evolved. We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization. And that has been the second great    couple         years          years    flow of our evolution. By changing our environment  we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve. Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities  all the way through modern medicine  we have changed our own evolution. Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history  which has been called many things   intentional evolution    evolution by design     very different than intelligent design    whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet. So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species  as well as our cultures  because of this change. Now we actually have been doing it for a long time. We started selectively breeding animals many  many thousands of years ago. And if you think of dogs for example  dogs are now intentionally designed creatures. There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature. Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like. But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them. We don't have to do it that way anymore. This is a beefalo. A beefalo is a buffalo cattle hybrid. And they are now making them  and someday  perhaps pretty soon  you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket. This is a geep  a goat sheep hybrid. The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards. I think they said it tasted like chicken. This is a cama. A cama is a camel llama hybrid  created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama. And they are now using these in certain cultures. Then there's the liger. This is the largest cat in the world    the lion tiger hybrid. It's bigger than a tiger. And in the case of the liger  there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild. But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology. And then finally  everybody's favorite  the zorse. None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures. And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement  or genetic manipulation  of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics. And if that were all this was about  then it would be an interesting thing. But something much  much more powerful is happening now. These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep sea jellyfish. We all know that some deep sea creatures glow. Well  they've now taken that gene  that bioluminescent gene  and put it into mammal cells. These are normal cells. And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light. Once they could do that with cells  they could do it with organisms. So they did it with mouse pups  kittens. And by the way  the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral  while this is from jellyfish. They did it with pigs. They did it with puppies. And  in fact  they did it with monkeys. And if you can do it with monkeys    though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes    if they can do it in monkeys  they can probably figure out how to do it in apes  which means they can do it in human beings. In other words  it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. Be easier to find us at night. And in fact  right now in many states  you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets. These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver. These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow  green  red  and they are actually available now in certain states. Other states have banned them. Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures. There is no area of the government    not the EPA or the FDA    that controls genetically engineered pets. And so some states have decided to allow them  some states have decided to ban them. Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically engineered salmon. The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon  using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat  to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed. And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether  pretty soon  you could be eating this fish    it'll be sold in the stores. And before you get too worried about it  here in the United States  the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically modified components to it. So even as we worry about it  we have allowed it to go on in this country    much different in Europe    without any regulation  and even without any identification on the package. These are all the first cloned animals of their type. So in the lower right here  you have Dolly  the first cloned sheep    now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh  Ralph the rat  the first cloned rat  CC the cat  for cloned cat  Snuppy  the first cloned dog    Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy    created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo  which he had not. He actually was the first person to clone a dog  which is a very difficult thing to do  because dog genomes are very plastic. This is Prometea  the first cloned horse. It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy  a real  gold ring  of cloning  because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings. In other words  the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed. But if you can clone that horse  you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud. These were the first cloned calves  the first cloned grey wolves  and then  finally  the first cloned piglets  Alexis  Chista  Carrel  Janie and Dotcom. In addition  we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species. This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create. So with antithrombin in that goat    that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create. And then in addition  transgenic pigs  knockout pigs  from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea  are pigs that they are going to use  in fact  to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them  instead of producing them in an industrial way. These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species. The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate. A somatic cell  a body cell  was taken from its body  gestated in the ovum of a cow  and then that cow gave birth to a guar. Same thing happened with the mouflon  where it's an endangered species of sheep. It was gestated in a regular sheep body  which actually raises an interesting biological problem. We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies. We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA  but we also have DNA in our mitochondria  which are the energy packets of the cell. That DNA is passed down through our mothers. So really  what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon  but a guar with cow mitochondria  and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA  and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA. These are really hybrids  not pure animals. And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology    a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve. This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach. And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top  and it's on a big computer tracking ball. And now  using a joystick  they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right  forwards or backwards. They've created a kind of insect bot  or bugbot. It gets worse than that    or perhaps better than that. This actually is one of DARPA's very important    DARPA is the Defense Research Agency    one of their projects. These goliath beetles are wired in their wings. They have a computer chip strapped to their backs  and they can fly these creatures around the lab. They can make them go left  right. They can make them take off. They can't actually make them land. They put them about one inch above the ground  and then they shut everything off and they go pfft. But it's the closest they can get to a landing. And in fact  this technology has gotten so developed that this creature    this is a moth    this is the moth in its pupa stage  and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology  so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth  it is already prewired. The wires are already in its body  and they can just hook it up to their technology  and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance. They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones. It's not just insects. This is the ratbot  or the robo rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate. Again  it's got technology    it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres  it's got a camera on top of its head. The scientists can make this creature go left  right. They have it running through mazes  controlling where it's going. They've now created an organic robot. The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar's lab said   Is this ethical  We've taken away the autonomy of this animal.  I'll get back to that in a minute. There's also been work done with monkeys. This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke. He took owl monkeys  wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved  especially looking at the movement of their right arm. The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways. They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm  which you see here in the picture  put the arm in another room. Pretty soon  the computer learned  by reading the monkey's brainwaves  to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did. Then he put a video monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm  and the monkey got fascinated. The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm  this prosthetic arm would do. And eventually she was moving it and moving it  and eventually stopped moving her right arm and  staring at the screen  could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves    which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms. And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals. This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida. He took        and then        disaggregated rat neurons    so these are just individual neurons from rats    put them on a chip. They self aggregated into a network  became an integrated chip. And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator. So now we have organic computer chips made out of living  self aggregating neurons. Finally  Mussa Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact  independent lamprey eel brain. This is a brain from a lamprey eel. It is living    fully intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides  attached photosensitive sensors to the brain  put it into a cart    here's the cart  the brain is sitting there in the middle    and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart  when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart  the cart moves toward the light  when you turn it off  it moves away. It's photophilic. So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain. Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts  sitting there in its nutrient medium  I don't know  but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding. So  we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes. This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts. He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin  put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being. Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation. This is where we are in this process. Finally  not that long ago  Craig Venter created the first artificial cell  where he took a cell  took a DNA synthesizer  which is a machine  created an artificial genome  put it in a different cell    the genome was not of the cell he put it in    and that cell then reproduced as the other cell. In other words  that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent    it did not have an organic parent. And so  asks The Economist   The first artificial organism and its consequences.  So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that. But in fact  that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like. This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like. This is a DNA synthesizer  and here at the bottom are just bottles of A  T  C and G    the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain. And so  we need to ask ourselves some questions. For the first time in the history of this planet  we are able to directly design organisms. We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power  and it confers on us a responsibility. Is everything okay  Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want  Do we have free reign to design animals  Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say   Look  I want a dog. I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund  the body of a retriever  maybe some pink fur  and let's make it glow in the dark   Does industry get to create creatures who  in their milk  in their blood  and in their saliva and other bodily fluids  create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines  Do we get to create organic robots  where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings  And then the final step of this  once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings  what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then  It's already happening. It's not science fiction. We are not only already using these things in animals  some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies. We are now taking control of our own evolution. We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet. It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now. It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future. Thanks. I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities  or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again. We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons. These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning  and it will give you extra strength  and it will further enhance your speed  and it will help you  for instance  to manage your balance. It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine. But not only that    it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there. This is just not some blue sky thinking. To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier  that on average does carry about     lbs. on their backs  and they are being asked to carry more equipment. Obviously  this is resulting in some major complications    back injuries     percent of them    chronic back injuries. So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue. So let me now introduce to you HULC    or the Human Universal Load Carrier. Soldier  With the HULC exoskeleton  I can carry     lbs. over varied terrain for many hours. Its flexible design allows for deep squats  crawls and high agility movements. It senses what I want to do  where I want to go  and then augments my strength and endurance. Eythor Bender  We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device  this new exoskeleton this year. So this is for real. Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users  something that I'm particularly passionate about. There are    million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide. This is about one percent of the total population. And that's actually a conservative estimate. We are talking here about  oftentimes  very young individuals with spinal cord injuries  that in the prime of their life      s    s    s    hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option. But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers. And the only option  pretty much    when it's stroke or other complications    is the wheelchair. And that is actually for the last     years  since its very successful introduction  I must say. So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility. Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that    years ago was spinal cord injured  and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for    years until now. Amanda Boxtel  Thank you. EB  Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. It has sensors. It's completely non invasive  sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back. There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips  as well as her knee joints  that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait. AB  I was    years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me. In a split second  I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis. Not long afterwards  a doctor strode into my hospital room  and he said   Amanda  you'll never walk again.  And that was    yeas ago. He robbed every ounce of hope from my being. Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again  to rock climb and even handcycle. But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk  until now. Thank you. EB  As you can see  we have the technology  we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you. It's in our hands  and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations    not only for the soldiers  or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users  but for everyone. AB  Thanks. Pep Rosenfeld  Folks  you've just met Claron McFadden. She is a world class soprano singer who studied in Rochester  New York. Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied. In August       Claron was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts  winning praise for her brilliance  her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality. Please welcome Claron McFadden. Claron McFadden  The human voice  mysterious  spontaneous  primal. For me  the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel    except  perhaps  jealousy. And the breath  the breath is the captain of that vessel. A child is born  takes its first breath    Whah  And we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression    mysterious  spontaneous and primal. A few years ago  I did a meditation retreat in Thailand. I wanted a place where I would have total silence and total solitude. I spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut    no music  no nothing    sounds of nature  trying to find the essence of concentration  being in the moment. On my last day  the woman who looked after the place  she came and we spoke for a minute  and then she said to me   Would you sing something for me   And I thought  but this is a place of total quiet and silence. I can't make noise. She said   Please  sing for me.  So I closed my eyes  I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was  Summertime   Porgy and Bess. Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high. Oh  your daddy's rich and your ma is good lookin'. So hush little baby  don't you cry. And I opened my eyes  and I saw that she had her eyes closed. And after a moment  she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said   It's like meditation.  And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for  to search for  I had it already in my singing    the calm  but alertness  the focus  but awareness  and being totally in the moment. When you're totally in the moment    when I'm totally in the moment  the vessel of expression is open. The emotions can flow from me to you and back. It's an extremely profound experience. There's a piece by a composer  an American composer called John Cage. It's called  Aria.  It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian. And the thing about this piece that's so special    if you see it behind me    it's not notated in any way. No notes  no flats  no sharps. But it's a kind of structure. And the singer  within this structure  has total freedom to be creative  spontaneous. For example  there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing    pop  country and western  opera  jazz    and you just have to be consistent with that color. You see there are different lines. You choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line  but you must respect it  more or less. And these little dots  these represent a sort of sound that's not a vocal  not a lyrical way of expressing the voice. Using the body    it could be sneezing  it could be coughing  animals    Exactly.  Laughter  Clapping  whatever. And there's different text. There's Armenian  Russian  French  English  Italian. So within this structure  one is free. To me  this piece is an ode to the voice  because it's mysterious  as we can see. It's quite spontaneous. And it's primal. So I would like to share this piece with you  It's  Aria   of John Cage. Hampart zoum Dirouhi Di questa Terra Naprasno Conscience et Tsk  tsk  tsk.

You think I've lost my way  and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat. I get that all the time in Dubai.  Here on holiday are you  dear    Come to visit the children  How long are you staying   Well actually  I hope for a while longer yet. I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over    years. And in that time  I have seen a lot of changes. Now that statistic is quite shocking. And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English. I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi. And one fine day  she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary. But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants  as well as their uses    medicinal uses  cosmetics  cooking  herbal. How did those students get all that knowledge  Of course  from their grandparents and even their great grandparents. It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations. But sadly  today  languages are dying at an unprecedented rate. A language dies every    days. Now  at the same time  English is the undisputed global language. Could there be a connection  Well I don't know. But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. When I first came out to the Gulf  I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post. Actually  not that long ago. That is a little bit too early. But nevertheless  I was recruited by the British Council  along with about    other teachers. And we were the first non Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait. We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education. And of course  the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth. Okay. Now this is the major change that I've seen    how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum  and no longer the sole domain of mother England  it has become a bandwagon for every English speaking nation on earth. And why not  After all  the best education    according to the latest World University Rankings    is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S. So everybody wants to have an English education  naturally. But if you're not a native speaker  you have to pass a test. Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone  Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius. Would he need the same language as a lawyer  for example  Well  I don't think so. We English teachers reject them all the time. We put a stop sign  and we stop them in their tracks. They can't pursue their dream any longer  'til they get English. Now let me put it this way  if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer  would I stop him from entering my British University  I don't think so. But indeed  that is exactly what we do. We English teachers are the gatekeepers. And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough. Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society. Maybe the barrier would be too universal. Okay.  But   I hear you say   what about the research  It's all in English.  So the books are in English  the journals are done in English  but that is a self fulfilling prophecy. It feeds the English requirement. And so it goes on. I ask you  what happened to translation  If you think about the Islamic Golden Age  there was lots of translation then. They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic  into Persian  and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages. And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe. Now don't get me wrong  I am not against teaching English  all you English teachers out there. I love it that we have a global language. We need one today more than ever. But I am against using it as a barrier. Do we really want to end up with     languages and the main one being English  or Chinese  We need more than that. Where do we draw the line  This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English  which is quite arbitrary. And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English  they didn't have to pass an English test. Case in point  Einstein. He  by the way  was considered remedial at school because he was  in fact  dyslexic. But fortunately for the world  he did not have to pass an English test. Because they didn't start until      with TOEFL  the American test of English. Now it's exploded. There are lots and lots of tests of English. And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. Now you might think  you and me   Those fees aren't bad  they're okay   but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. So immediately  we're rejecting them. It brings to mind a headline I saw recently   Education  The Great Divide.  Now I get it  I understand why people would want to focus on English. They want to give their children the best chance in life. And to do that  they need a Western education. Because  of course  the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities  that I put on earlier. It's a circular thing. Okay. Let me tell you a story about two scientists  two English scientists. They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. But they couldn't get the results they wanted. They really didn't know what to do  until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb  whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German. So bingo  problem solved. If you can't think a thought  you are stuck. But if another language can think that thought  then  by cooperating  we can achieve and learn so much more. My daughter came to England from Kuwait. She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic. It's an Arabic medium school. She had to translate it into English at her grammar school. And she was the best in the class at those subjects. Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad  we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know  and they know it in their own language. When a language dies  we don't know what we lose with that language. This is    I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently    they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village  like all the village children  because the kerosene lamp  it had smoke and it damaged his eyes. And anyway  there was never enough kerosene  because what does a dollar a day buy for you  So he invented a cost free solar lamp. And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home. When he received his award  he said these lovely words   The children can lead Africa from what it is today  a dark continent  to a light continent.  A simple idea  but it could have such far reaching consequences. People who have no light  whether it's physical or metaphorical  cannot pass our exams  and we can never know what they know. Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark. Let us celebrate diversity. Mind your language. Use it to spread great ideas. Thank you very much. The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple. We don't want Iran to get the bomb. Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The gray boxes that you see  these are real time control systems. Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves  we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge. The gray boxes don't run Windows software  they are a completely different technology. But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box  then we are in business. And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. So we start with a Windows dropper. The payload goes onto the gray box  damages the centrifuge  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed    mission accomplished. That's easy  huh  I want to tell you how we found that out. When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. The only thing that was known is it's very  very complex on the Windows part  the dropper part  used multiple zero day vulnerabilities. And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes  these real time control systems. So that got our attention  and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out. And then some very funny things happened. Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese    sniffed  but didn't want to eat. Didn't make sense to me. And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese  I realized  well  this is a directed attack. It's completely directed. The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target. And if not  Stuxnet does nothing. So that really got my attention  and we started to work on this nearly around the clock  because I thought   Well  we don't know what the target is. It could be  let's say for example  a U.S. power plant  or a chemical plant in Germany. So we better find out what the target is soon.  So we extracted and decompiled the attack code  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs    a smaller one and a bigger one. And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack. They probably even know the shoe size of the operator. So they know everything. And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high tech  let me tell you this  the payload is rocket science. It's way above everything that we have ever seen before. Here you see a sample of this actual attack code. We are talking about    around about        lines of code. Looks pretty much like old style assembly language. And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code. So what we were looking for is  first of all  system function calls  because we know what they do. And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world    to potential real world targets. So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. In order to get target theories  we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage  it must be a high value target and it is most likely located in Iran  because that's where most of the infections had been reported. Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. So I told my assistant   Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.  And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data. And that worked pretty well. So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control. The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge  that black object that you see. And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor  you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode. What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy    obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly. The big digital warhead    we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures. So for example  the number     really stands out in that code  you can't overlook it. I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade  and each cascade holds     centrifuges. So that made sense  that was a match. And it even got better. These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into     what is called  stages. And guess what we found in the attack code  An almost identical structure. So again  that was a real good match. And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. Now don't get me wrong here  it didn't go like this. These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor. And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover. Anyway  so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target  but from different angles. The small warhead is taking one cascade  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down  and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves. So in all  we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is. It is Natanz  and it is only Natanz. So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet. Here's some very cool stuff that we saw    really knocked my socks off. Down there is the gray box  and on the top you see the centrifuges. Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors    so for example  from pressure sensors and vibration sensors    and it provides legitimate program code  which is still running during the attack  with fake input data. And as a matter of fact  this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet. So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. That's cool  huh  The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room. It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough. So for example  in a power plant  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed  you must open relief valves within a millisecond. Obviously  this cannot be done by a human operator. So this is where we need digital safety systems. And when they are compromised  then real bad things can happen. Your plant can blow up. And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it. That's scary. But it gets worse. And this is very important  what I'm going to say. Think about this  this attack is generic. It doesn't have anything to do  in specifics  with centrifuges  with uranium enrichment. So it would work as well  for example  in a power plant or in an automobile factory. It is generic. And you don't have    as an attacker    you don't have to deliver this payload by a USB stick  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet. You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. Just spread it as wide as possible. And if you do that  what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction. That's the consequence that we have to face. So unfortunately  the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East. They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. So all of the green areas  these are your target rich environments. We have to face the consequences  and we better start to prepare right now. Thanks. Chris Anderson  I've got a question. Ralph  it's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this. Is that your opinion  Ralph Langner  Okay  you really want to hear that  Yeah. Okay. My opinion is that the Mossad is involved  but that the leading force is not Israel. So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower. There is only one  and that's the United States    fortunately  fortunately. Because otherwise  our problems would even be bigger. CA  Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you  Ralph. Adrian Kohler  Well  we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. Basil Jones  But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena. AK  The ancestor of the horse. Okay  we'll do something with it. Hahahaha. The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called  Faustus in Africa   a Handspring Production from       where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy. This production was directed by South African artist and theater director  William Kentridge. So it needed a very articulate front paw. But  like all puppets  it has other attributes. BJ  One of them is breath  and it kind of breathes. AK  Haa haa haaa. BJ  Breath is really important for us. It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage. It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet    AK  Oops. BJ  From an actor. Puppets always have to try to be alive. It's their kind of ur story onstage  that desperation to live. AK  Yeah  it's basically a dead object  as you can see  and it only lives because you make it. An actor struggles to die onstage  but a puppet has to struggle to live. And in a way that's a metaphor for life. BJ  So every moment it's on the stage  it's making the struggle. So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up to the minute   th century technology    to turn nouns into verbs. AK  Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life. BJ  Okay so. AK  It has ears that move passively when the head goes. BJ  And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood  covered with fabric    curiously similar  in fact  to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. AK  In Port Elizabeth  the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa. BJ  His mother was a puppeteer. And when we met at art school and fell in love in       I hated puppets. I really thought they were so beneath me. I wanted to become an avant garde artist    and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go. And  in fact  it took about    years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa  where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry  to learn a renewed  or a new  respect for this art form. AK  So in       I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company. And    years later  miraculously  we collaborated with a company from Mali  the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako  where we made a piece about a tall giraffe. It was just called  Tall Horse   which was a life sized giraffe. BJ  And here again  you see the same structure. The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane  but it's ultimately the same structure. It's got two people inside it on stilts  which give them the height  and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. AK  The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail  a bit like the hyena    same mechanism  just a bit bigger. And he's controlling the ear movement. BJ  So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London. And just around that time  his mother had said   Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'   AK  It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse. The horse is sold to the First World War  and he joins up to find his horse. BJ  So Tom gave us a call and said   Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre   AK  It seemed a lovely idea. BJ  But it had to ride. It had to have a rider. AK  It had to have a rider  and it had to participate in cavalry charges. A play about early   th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London. But they agreed to go along with it for a while. So we began with a test. BJ  This is Adrian and Thys Stander  who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse  and our next door neighbor Katherine  riding on a ladder. The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. AK  And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell  we knew that we might be able to make a horse  which could be ridden. So we made a model. This is a cardboard model  a little bit smaller than the hyena. You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there. BJ  And the two manipulators are inside. But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator  because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time. AK  We started work on the prototype after the model was approved  and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated. We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones. And we had a crate built for it. It had to be shipped to London. We were going to test drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town  and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. BJ  So we got a camera  and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances. And we sent it off to the National Theatre  hoping that they believed that we created something that worked. AK  A month later  we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. BJ  About    people. AK  We were terrified. We opened the lid  we took the horse out  and it did work  it walked and it was able to be ridden. Here I have an    second clip of the very first walk of the prototype. This is in the National Theatre studio  the place where they cook new ideas. It had by no means got the green light yet. The choreographer  Toby Sedgwick  invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse  which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs  grew up into the big horse. And Nick Starr  the director of the National Theatre  saw that particular moment  he was standing next to me    he nearly wet himself. And so the show was given the green light. And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely. Here is the plan. And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses. You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there. The horses are completely handmade. There is very little   th century technology in them. We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces. But because they have to be light and flexible  and each one of them is different  they can't be mass produced  unfortunately. So here are some half finished horses ready to be worked in London. And now we would like to introduce you to Joey. Joey boy  you there  Joey. Joey. Joey  come here. No  no  I haven't got it. He's got it  it's in his pocket. BJ  Joey. AK  Joey  Joey  Joey  Joey. Come here. Stand here where people can see you. Move around. Come on. I'd just like to describe    I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated. Here  Craig is working the head. He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand. Each one of them operates either an ear  separately  or the head  up and down. But he also controls the head directly by using his hand. The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse. When they point right back  the horse is fearful or angry  depending upon what's going on in front of him  around him. Or  when he's more relaxed  the head comes down and the ears listen  either side. Horses' hearing is very important. It's almost more important than their eyesight. Over here  Tommy's got what you call the heart position. He's working the leg. You see the string tendon from the hyena  the hyena's front leg  automatically pulls the hoop up. Horses are so unpredictable. The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action. The hind legs have got the same action. BJ  And Mikey also has  in his fingers  the ability to move the tail from left to right  and up and down with the other hand. And together  there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression. AK  You want to say something about the breathing  BJ  We had a big challenge with breathing. Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that    because that's how a horse would breathe  with an expanded chest. But we realized that  if that were to be happening  you wouldn't  as an audience  see the breath. So he made a channel in here  and the chest moves up and down in that channel. So it's anti naturalistic really  the up and down movement  but it feels like breath. And it's very  very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees. AK  Other emotional stuff. If I were to touch the horse here on his skin  the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver. You'll notice  of course  that the puppet is made out of cane lines. And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice  that I was making a three dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space. But of course  it was the cane is light  the cane is flexible  the cane is durable and the cane is moldable. And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. The skin itself is made out of a see through nylon mesh  which  if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear  she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike. You see the skeletal structure of it. Or if you light it from above  it becomes more solid. Again  that was a practical consideration. The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out. They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production. And it's very much an in the moment activity that they're engaged in. It's three heads making one character. But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces. And plant. Thank you. And now just    All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. BJ  Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd. The sound that that very large chest makes  of the horse    the whinnying and the nickering and everything    that starts usually with one performer  carries on with a second person and ends with a third. AK  Mikey Brett from Leicestershire. Mikey Brett  Craig  Leo  Zem Joaquin and Basil and me. Thank you. Thank you. As a boy  I loved cars. When I turned     I lost my best friend to a car accident. Like this. And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. Now I haven't succeeded  so this is just a progress report  but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self driving cars. I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self driving car that could navigate a desert. And even though a hundred teams were there  these cars went nowhere. So we decided at Stanford to build a different self driving car. We built the hardware and the software. We made it learn from us  and we set it free in the desert. And the unimaginable happened  it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge  winning Stanford   million dollars. Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. Since  our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves    any street in California. We've driven         miles. Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. It's the perfect driving mechanism. We've driven in cities  like in San Francisco here. We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway  . We've encountered joggers  busy highways  toll booths  and this is without a person in the loop  the car just drives itself. In fact  while we drove         miles  people didn't even notice. Mountain roads  day and night  and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco. Sometimes our cars get so crazy  they even do little stunts. What  Second Man  It's driving itself. Sebastian Thrun  Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life  but I can do something for all the people who died. Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people  And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error  and can therefore be prevented by machines  Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane    improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes  and do away with all traffic jams on highways  Do you realize that you  TED users  spend an average of    minutes per day in traffic  wasting your time on your daily commute  You could regain this time. This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone. And it's  .  billion gallons of gasoline wasted. Now I think there's a vision here  a new technology  and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. Thank you. I wanted to be a rock star. I dreamed of it  and that's all I dreamed of. To be more accurate  I wanted to be a pop star. This was in the late '  s. And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran. They wouldn't have me. I didn't read music  but I played synthesizers and drum machines. And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada. And I was certain that's what my life would be. And when I went to college at the University of Nevada  Las Vegas when I was     I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star      or even a degree program for that interest. And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir. And I said   Yes  I would love to do that. It sounds great.  And I left the room and said   No way.  The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky  and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people. And about a week later  a friend of mine came to me and said   Listen  you've got to join choir. At the end of the semester  we're taking a trip to Mexico  all expenses paid. And the soprano section is just full of hot girls.  And so I figured for Mexico and babes  I could do just about anything. And I went to my first day in choir  and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing. They opened their scores  the conductor gave the downbeat  and boom  they launched into the Kyrie from the  Requiem  by Mozart. In my entire life I had seen in black and white  and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor. The most transformative experience I've ever had    in that single moment  hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing  people together  the shared vision. And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself. And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section  as it turns out. I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life. I had learned to read music by then  or slowly learning to read music. And that piece was published  and then I wrote another piece  and that got published. And then I started conducting  and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School. And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor. Well a couple of years ago  a friend of mine emailed me a link  a YouTube link  and said   You have got to see this.  And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me  singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called  Sleep.  My name is Britlin Losee  and this is a video that I'd like to make for you. Here's me singing  Sleep.  I'm a little nervous  just to let you know.   If there are noises     in the night   Eric Whitacre  I was thunderstruck. Britlin was so innocent and so sweet  and her voice was so pure. And I even loved seeing behind her  I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room. Such an intimate video. And I had this idea  if I could get    people to all do this same thing  sing their parts    soprano  alto  tenor and bass    wherever they were in the world  post their videos to YouTube  we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir. So I wrote on my blog   OMG OMG.  I actually wrote   OMG   hopefully for the last time in public ever. And I sent out this call to singers. And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year      called  Lux Aurumque   which means  light and gold.  And lo and behold  people started uploading their videos. Now I should say  before that  what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting. And it's in complete silence when I filmed it  because I was only hearing the music in my head  imagining the choir that would one day come to be. Afterwards  I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to. And then as the videos started to come in ... This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore. This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts. Stephen Hanson from Sweden. This is Jamal Walker from Dallas  Texas. There was even a little soprano solo in the piece  and so I had auditions. And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts. I was told later  and also by lots of singers who were involved in this  that they sometimes recorded    or    different takes until they got just the right take    they uploaded it. Here's our winner of the soprano solo. This is Melody Myers from Tennessee. I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note    like   No problem  everything's fine.  And from the crowd emerged this young man  Scott Haines. And he said   Listen  this is the project I've been looking for my whole life. I'd like to be the person to edit this all together.  I said   Thank you  Scott. I'm so glad that you found me.  And Scott aggregated all of the videos. He scrubbed the audio. He made sure that everything lined up. And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago. This is  Lux Aurumque  sung by the Virtual Choir. I'll stop it there in the interest of time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So there's more. There's more. Thank you so much. And I had the same reaction you did. I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it. I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it    these souls all on their own desert island  sending electronic messages in bottles to each other. And the video went viral. We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it. And because of that  then a lot of singers started saying   All right  what's Virtual Choir  .    And so I decided for Virtual Choir  .  that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing   Sleep   which is another work that I wrote in the year         poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri. And again  I posted a conductor video  and we started accepting submissions. This time we got some more mature members. And some younger members.   Safe in bed   EW  That's Georgie from England. She's only nine. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen  Someone did all eight videos    a bass even singing the soprano parts. This is Beau Awtin. EW  And our goal    it was sort of an arbitrary goal    there was an MTV video where they all sang  Lollipop  and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody. And there were     people involved in that. So I told the singers   That's our goal. That's the number for us to beat.  And we just closed submissions January   th  and our final tally was       videos from    different countries. Thank you. From Malta  Madagascar  Thailand  Vietnam  Jordan  Egypt  Israel  as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand. And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials  what it was like for them  their experience singing it. And I've just chosen a few of them here.  My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly. Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling. It's so wonderful to sing together again   I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.  Aside from the beautiful music  it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before  but who are connected anyway.  And my personal favorite   When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this  he told me that I did not have the voice for it.  Yeah  I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too. Me too.  It hurt so much  and I shed some tears  but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words. It is a dream come true to be part of this choir  as I've never been part of one. When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map  I had to go with the nearest city  which is about     miles away from where I live. As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush  satellite is my connection to the world.  So two things struck me deeply about this. The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other. It doesn't matter the technology. And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection. It wasn't a virtual choir. There are people now online that are friends  they've never met. But  I know myself too  I feel this virtual esprit de corps  if you will  with all of them. I feel a closeness to this choir    almost like a family. What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at  Sleep  by Virtual Choir  . . This will be a premiere today. We're not finished with the video yet. You can imagine  with       synchronized YouTube videos  the render time is just atrocious. But we do have the first three minutes. And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first. You're the very first people to see this. This is  Sleep   the Virtual Choir.   beneath the moon     A silver thread on darkened dune     With closing eyes and resting head     I know that sleep is coming soon     Upon my pillow      safe in bed      a thousand pictures fill my head     I cannot sleep     my mind's aflight     and yet my limbs seem made of lead     If there are noises in the night   Eric Whitacre  Thank you very  very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a huge believer in hands on education. But you have to have the right tools. If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics  I'm not going to give her a soldering iron. And similarly  she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands. So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of  Play Doh. And so we spent a summer looking at different Play Doh recipes. And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play dough    pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen. We have two favorite recipes    one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt. And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these. But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together. You see that really salty Play Doh  Well  it conducts electricity. And this is nothing new. It turns out that regular Play Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity  and high school physics teachers have used that for years. But our homemade play dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play Doh. And that sugar dough  Well it's     times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. So what does that mean  Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits    circuits that the most creative  tiny  little hands can build on their own. And so I want to do a little demo for you. So if I take this salt dough  again  it's like the play dough you probably made as kids  and I plug it in    it's a two lead battery pack  simple battery pack  you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else    we can actually then light things up. But if any of you have studied electrical engineering  we can also create a short circuit. If I push these together  the light turns off. Right  the current wants to run through the play dough  not through that LED. If I separate them again  I have some light. Well now if I take that sugar dough  the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. It's like a wall to the electricity. If I place that between  now all the dough is touching  but if I stick that light back in  I have light. In fact  I could even add some movement to my sculptures. If I want a spinning tail  let's grab a motor  put some play dough on it  stick it on and we have spinning. And once you have the basics  we can make a slightly more complicated circuit. We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids. I plug in again the power to it. And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits. I can start plugging in lots of lights. And we can start talking about things like electrical load. What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor  It'll dim. We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done. You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this. So this is all in your home kitchen. We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab. We have a website  it's all there. These are the home recipes. We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves. And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone. We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids  to a science researcher in the U.K.  and curriculum developers in Hawaii. So I would encourage you all to grab some Play Doh  grab some salt  grab some sugar and start playing. We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers  but maybe we should. Have fun. Thank you. Ten years ago  on a Tuesday morning  I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg  North Carolina. It was a routine training jump  like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper    years before. We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early. You do some routine refresher training  and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you. And you put on the T    parachute. And you're very careful how you put the straps  particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs. And then you put on your reserve  and then you put on your heavy rucksack. And then a jumpmaster comes  and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations. He checks you out  he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed  your shoulders are crushed down  and  of course  he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well. Then you sit down  and you wait a little while  because this is the Army. Then you load the aircraft  and then you stand up and you get on  and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this  in a line of people  and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft. And you wait a little bit longer  because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait. Then you take off. And it's painful enough now    and I think it's designed this way    it's painful enough so you want to jump. You didn't really want to jump  but you want out. So you get in the aircraft  you're flying along  and at    minutes out  these jumpmasters start giving you commands. They give    minutes    that's a time warning. You sit there  OK. Then they give you    minutes. And of course  you're responding with all of these. And that's to boost everybody's confidence  to show that you're not scared. Then they give you   Get ready.  Then they go   Outboard personnel  stand up.  If you're an outboard personnel  now you stand up. If you're an inboard personnel  stand up. And then you hook up  and you hook up your static line. And at that point  you think   Hey  guess what  I'm probably going to jump. There's no way to get out of this at this point.  You go through some additional checks  and then they open the door. And this was that Tuesday morning in September  and it was pretty nice outside. So nice air comes flowing in. The jumpmasters start to check the door. And then when it's time to go  a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes   Go.  The first guy goes  and you're just in line  and you just kind of lumber to the door. Jump is a misnomer  you fall. You fall outside the door  you're caught in the slipstream. The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position    head down in your chest  your arms extended  put over your reserve parachute. You do that because     years before  an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that. I have no idea whether it makes any difference  but he seemed to make sense  and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong. And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open. If you don't get an opening shock  you don't get a parachute    you've got a whole new problem set. But typically you do  typically it opens. And of course  if your leg straps aren't set right  at that point you get another little thrill. Boom. So then you look around  you're under a canopy and you say   This is good.  Now you prepare for the inevitable. You are going to hit the ground. You can't delay that much. And you really can't decide where you hit very much  because they pretend you can steer  but you're being delivered. So you look around  where you're going to land  you try to make yourself ready. And then as you get close  you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line  so that it's not on you when you land  and you prepare to do a parachute landing fall. Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance    the toes of your feet  your calves  your thighs  your buttocks and your push up muscles. It's this elegant little land  twist and roll. And that's not going to hurt. In    some years of jumping  I never did one. I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window. And as soon as I hit  the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed. I'd shake my head  and I'd ask myself the eternal question   Why didn't I go into banking   And I'd look around  and then I'd see another paratrooper  a young guy or girl  and they'd have pulled out their M  carbine and they'd be picking up their equipment. They'd be doing everything that we had taught them. And I realized that  if they had to go into combat  they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders. And I realized that  if they came out of combat  it would be because we led them well. And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did. So now I do that Tuesday morning jump  but it's not any jump    that was September   th      . And when we took off from the airfield  America was at peace. When we landed on the drop zone  everything had changed. And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very  very real    and leadership seemed important. But things had changed  I was a    year old brigadier general. I'd been successful  but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes  and on that morning  I didn't know it. I was raised with traditional stories of leadership  Robert E. Lee  John Buford at Gettysburg. And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership. This was my father in Vietnam. And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful  they didn't lie  cheat  steal or abandon their comrades. And I still believe real leaders are like that. But in my first    years of career  I had a bunch of different experiences. One of my first battalion commanders  I worked in his battalion for    months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile    of a    mile road march  and he chewed my ass for about    seconds. And I'm not sure that was real interaction. But then a couple of years later  when I was a company commander  I went out to the National Training Center. And we did an operation  and my company did a dawn attack    you know  the classic dawn attack  you prepare all night  move to the line of departure. And I had an armored organization at that point. We move forward  and we get wiped out    I mean  wiped out immediately. The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it. And after the battle  they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an  after action review  to teach you what you've done wrong. Sort of leadership by humiliation. They put a big screen up  and they take you through everything   and then you didn't do this  and you didn't do this  etc.  I walked out feeling as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut. And I saw my battalion commander  because I had let him down. And I went up to apologize to him  and he said   Stanley  I thought you did great.  And in one sentence  he lifted me  put me back on my feet  and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure. When      came     year old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world. First  the things that are obvious  that you're familiar with  the environment changed    the speed  the scrutiny  the sensitivity of everything now is so fast  sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it. But everything we do is in a different context. More importantly  the force that I led was spread over more than    countries. And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them  I'm now leading a force that's dispersed  and I've got to use other techniques. I've got to use video teleconferences  I've got to use chat  I've got to use email  I've got to use phone calls    I've got to use everything I can  not just for communication  but for leadership. A    year old individual operating alone  thousands of miles from me  has got to communicate to me with confidence. I have to have trust in them and vice versa. And I also have to build their faith. And that's a new kind of leadership for me. We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations. An emerging opportunity came    didn't have time to get everybody together. So we had to get complex intelligence together  we had to line up the ability to act. It was sensitive  we had to go up the chain of command  convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium. We failed. The mission didn't work. And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force  rebuild their confidence    me and them  and them and me  and our seniors and us as a force    all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder. Entirely new requirement. Also  the people had changed. You probably think that the force that I led was all steely eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons. In reality  much of the force I led looked exactly like you. It was men  women  young  old    not just from military  from different organizations  many of them detailed to us just from a handshake. And so instead of giving orders  you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose. Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference  the ages  had changed so much. I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan  and on that operation  a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team. We talked about the operation  and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that. I asked   Where were you on        And one young Ranger in the back    his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind    he said   Sir  I was in the sixth grade.  And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness  and yet he has different experiences  in many cases a different vocabulary  a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders. And yet  we need to have that shared sense. It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise  because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot  that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore. So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing  And it's a brand new leadership challenge. And it forced me to become a lot more transparent  a lot more willing to listen  a lot more willing to be reverse mentored from lower. And yet  again  you're not all in one room. Then another thing. There's an effect on you and on your leaders. There's an impact  it's cumulative. You don't reset  or recharge your battery every time. I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces. And I remembered his son was in our force. And I said   John  where's your son  And how is he   And he said   Sir  he's fine. Thanks for asking.  I said   Where is he now   And he pointed at the screen  he said   He's in that firefight.  Think about watching your brother  father  daughter  son  wife in a firefight in real time and you can't do anything about it. Think about knowing that over time. And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders. And you have to watch and take care of each other. I probably learned the most about relationships. I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together. I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment. And every morning in the Ranger regiment  every Ranger    and there are more than       of them    says a six stanza Ranger creed. You may know one line of it  it says   I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy.  And it's not a mindless mantra  and it's not a poem. It's a promise. Every Ranger promises every other Ranger   No matter what happens  no matter what it costs me  if you need me  I'm coming.  And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger. Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful. It's probably more powerful than marriage vows. And they've lived up to it  which gives it special power. And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing. And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever. We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in       and an old friend of mine  that I had spent many years at various points of my career with    godfather to one of their kids    he sent me a note  just in an envelope  that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said   I knew if I ever got in a tight spot  that you would come  if alive.  And having that kind of relationship  for me  turned out to be critical at many points in my career. And I learned that you have to give that in this environment  because it's tough. That was my journey. I hope it's not over. I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right  they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust. This isn't easy stuff. It's not like that electronic abs machine where     minutes a month  you get washboard abs. And it isn't always fair. You can get knocked down  and it hurts and it leaves scars. But if you're a leader  the people you've counted on will help you up. And if you're a leader  the people who count on you need you on your feet. Thank you. So what does the happiest man in the world look like  He certainly doesn't look like me. He looks like this. His name is Matthieu Ricard. So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world  Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain. And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI  versus the right prefrontal cortex. And Matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts. He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. Which leads us to a question  What was he thinking when he was being measured  Perhaps something very naughty. Actually  he was meditating on compassion. Matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever. Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life. My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime    and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale. And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work. Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore. Compassion is something that creates happiness. Compassion is fun. And that mind blowing insight changes the entire game. Because if compassion was a chore  nobody's going to do it  except maybe the Dalai Lama or something. But if compassion was fun  everybody's going to do it. Therefore  to create the conditions for global compassion  all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun. But fun is not enough. What if compassion is also profitable  What if compassion is also good for business  Then  every boss  every manager in the world  will want to have compassion    like this. That would create the conditions for world peace. So  I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting. Fortunately  I didn't have to look very far. Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes    in Google  my company. I know there are other compassionate companies in the world  but Google is the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for    years  so I'll use Google as the case study. Google is a company born of idealism. It's a company that thrives on idealism. And maybe because of that  compassion is organic and widespread company wide. In Google  expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern. It's sort of a funny pattern. It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something. And they don't usually ask for permission  they just go ahead and do it  and then other Googlers join in  and it just gets bigger and bigger. And sometimes it gets big enough to become official. So in other words  it almost always starts from the bottom up. And let me give you some examples. The first example is the largest annual community event    where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities    was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official  because it just became too big. Another example  three Googlers    a chef  an engineer and  most funny  a massage therapist    three of them  they learned about a region in India where         people live without a single medical facility. So what do they do  They just go ahead and start a fundraiser. And they raise enough money to build this hospital    the first hospital of its kind for         people. During the Haiti earthquake  a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones. And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices. In China for example  one mid level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China  involving more than       schools in China  working on issues such as education  poverty  health care and the environment. There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. And this idea  again  came from the grassroots  from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job. And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy. It was two persons saying   Let's do this   and the company said   Yes.  So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company  because Googlers found compassion to be fun. But again  fun is not enough. There are also real business benefits. So what are they  The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders. What does that mean  There are three components of compassion. There is the affective component  which is   I feel for you.  There is the cognitive component  which is   I understand you.  And there is a motivational component  which is   I want to help you.  So what has this got to do with business leadership  According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins  and documented in the book  Good to Great   it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness. And he calls them  Level   leaders.  These are leaders who  in addition to being highly capable  possess two important qualities  and they are humility and ambition. These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good. And because they're ambitious for a greater good  they feel no need to inflate their own egos. And they  according to the research  make the best business leaders. And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion  we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion    understanding people and empathizing with people    inhibits  tones down  what I call the excessive self obsession that's in us  therefore creating the conditions for humility. The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good. In other words  compassion is the way to grow Level   leaders. And this is the first compelling business benefit. The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce. Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good. It creates a vibrant  energetic community where people admire and respect each other. I mean  you come to work in the morning  and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India. It's like how can you not be inspired by those people    your own coworkers  So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration  initiative and creativity. It makes us a highly effective company. So  having said all that  what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting  In our experience  there are three ingredients. The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good. So always think  how is your company and your job serving the greater good  Or  how can you further serve the greater good  This awareness of serving the greater good is very self inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in. That's one. The second ingredient is autonomy. So in Google  there's a lot of autonomy. And one of our most popular managers jokes that  this is what he says   Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum.  And he considers himself one of the inmates. If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free  they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way. The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth. Leadership training in Google  for example  places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities  such as self awareness  self mastery  empathy and compassion  because we believe that leadership begins with character. We even created a seven week curriculum on emotion intelligence  which we jokingly call  Searching Inside Yourself.  It's less naughty than it sounds. So I'm an engineer by training  but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course  which I find kind of funny  because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence. What a company. So  Search Inside Yourself     how does it work  It works in three steps. The first step is attention training. Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. Therefore  any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training. The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence. The second step follows the first step. The second step is developing self knowledge and self mastery. So using the supercharged attention from step one  we create a high resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes. What does that mean  It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity  objectivity and from a third person perspective. And once you can do that  you create the kind of self knowledge that enables self mastery. The third step  following the second step  is to create new mental habits. What does that mean  Imagine this. Imagine whenever you meet any other person  any time you meet a person  your habitual  instinctive first thought is   I want you to be happy. I want you to be happy.  Imagine you can do that. Having this habit  this mental habit  changes everything at work. Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people  and it creates trust  and trust creates a lot of good working relationships. And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace. Someday  we hope to open source  Search Inside Yourself  so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference. And in closing  I want to end the same place I started  with happiness. I want to quote this guy    the guy in robes  not the other guy    the Dalai Lama  who said   If you want others to be happy  practice compassion. If you want to be happy  practice compassion.  I found this to be true  both on the individual level and at a corporate level. And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too. Thank you. I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous. I went to prison    difficult. I worked in a coal mine    dangerous. I filmed in war zones    difficult and dangerous. And I spent    days eating nothing but this    fun in the beginning  little difficult in the middle  very dangerous in the end. In fact  most of my career  I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging  that make them interesting  that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience. So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship  I knew I would want to do something a little different. So as some of you may or may not have heard  a couple weeks ago  I took out an ad on eBay. I sent out some Facebook messages  some Twitter messages  and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my      TED Talk. That's right  some lucky individual  corporation  for profit or non profit  was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity    because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again    to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now  that at the time didn't have a title  didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be. So what you were getting was this  Your name here presents  My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and  depending on the content  could ultimately blow up in your face  especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it. But that being said  it's a very good media opportunity. You know how many people watch these TED Talks  It's a lot. That's just a working title  by the way. So even with that caveat  I knew that someone would buy the naming rights. Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago  I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty. But in the new project that I'm working on  my new film  we examine the world of marketing  advertising. And as I said earlier  I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years  but nothing could prepare me  nothing could ready me  for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. You see  I had this idea for a movie. all about product placement  marketing and advertising  where the entire film is funded by product placement  marketing and advertising. So the movie will be called  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  So what happens in  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold   is that everything from top to bottom  from start to finish  is branded from beginning to end    from the above the title sponsor that you'll see in the movie  which is brand X. Now this brand  the Qualcomm Stadium  the Staples Center ... these people will be married to the film in perpetuity    forever. And so the film explores this whole idea     Michael Kassan  It's redundant.  It's what   MK  It's redundant.  In perpetuity  forever  I'm a redundant person.  MK  I'm just saying.  That was more for emphasis. It was   In perpetuity. Forever.  But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor  but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ... the greatest car you ever drove from  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold   the greatest drink you've ever had  courtesy of  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  Xavier Kochhar  So the idea is  beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life  but actually get them to finance the film   MS  Get them to finance the film.  MS  And actually we show the whole process of how does it work. The goal of this whole film is transparency. You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie. So that's the whole concept  the whole film  start to finish. And I would love for CEG to help make it happen. Robert Friedman  You know it's funny  because when I first hear it  it is the ultimate respect for an audience. Guy  I don't know how receptive people are going to be to it  though. XK  Do you have a perspective    I don't want to use  angle  because that has a negative connotation    but do you know how this is going to play out   MS  No idea.  David Cohn  How much money does it take to do this  MS   .  million.  DC  Okay.  John Kamen  I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them  but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big  really obvious brands. XK  Who knows  maybe by the time your film comes out  we look like a bunch of blithering idiots. MS  What do you think the response is going to be  Stuart Ruderfer  The responses mostly will be  no.  MS  But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me  JK  Both. MS  ... Meaning not so optimistic. So  sir  can you help me  I need help. MK  I can help you. MS  Okay.  MK  Good.  Awesome. MK  We've gotta figure out which brands. MS  Yeah.  MK  That's the challenge.  When you look at the people you deal with .. MK  We've got some places we can go.  MS  Okay.  Turn the camera off. MS  I thought  Turn the camera off  meant   Let's have an off the record conversation.  Turns out it really means   We want nothing to do with your movie.  MS  And just like that  one by one  all of these companies suddenly disappeared. None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. I was amazed. They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project. And I was blown away  because I thought the whole concept  the idea of advertising  was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible  to get as many people to see it as possible. Especially in today's world  this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape  isn't the idea to get that new buzz worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses  No  that's what I thought. But the problem was  you see  my idea had one fatal flaw  and that flaw was this. Actually no  that was not the flaw whatsoever. That wouldn't have been a problem at all. This would have been fine. But what this image represents was the problem. See  when you do a Google image search for transparency  this is     This is one of the first images that comes up. So I like the way you roll  Sergey Brin. No. This is was the problem  transparency    free from pretense or deceit  easily detected or seen through  readily understood  characterized by visibility or accessibility of information  especially concerning business practices    that last line being probably the biggest problem. You see  we hear a lot about transparency these days. Our politicians say it  our president says it  even our CEO's say it. But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality  something suddenly changes. But why  Well  transparency is scary    like that odd  still screaming bear. It's unpredictable    like this odd country road. And it's also very risky. What else is risky  Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip. That's very risky. Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story  and they said   No  we want you to tell a story. We want you to tell a story  but we just want to tell our story.  See  when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie    and there he is giving me the look he often gave me    he would say   Son  there's three sides to every story. There's your story  there's my story and there's the real story.  Now you see  with this film  we wanted to tell the real story. But with only one company  one agency willing to help me    and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years    I realized that I would have to go on my own  I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team. So what you suddenly started to realize    or what I started to realize    is that when you started having conversations with these companies  the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem. and I have friends who make little independent films like I make. And the friends of mine who make big  giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have. And then my friends who make small independent films say   Well  how are we supposed to compete with these big  giant Hollywood movies   And the movie is called  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  So how specifically will we see Ban in the film  Any time I'm ready to go  any time I open up my medicine cabinet  you will see Ban deodorant. While anytime I do an interview with someone  I can say   Are you fresh enough for this interview  Are you ready  You look a little nervous. I want to help you calm down. So maybe you should put some one before the interview.  So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents. Whether it's a  Floral Fusion  or a  Paradise Winds   they'll have their chance. We will have them geared for both male or female    solid  roll on or stick  whatever it may be. That's the two cent tour. So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five cent tour. Karen Frank  We are a smaller brand. Much like you talked about being a smaller movie  we're very much a challenger brand. So we don't have the budgets that other brands have. So doing things like this    you know  remind people about Ban    is kind of why were interested in it. MS  What are the words that you would use to describe Ban  Ban is blank. KF  That's a great question. Woman  Superior technology. MS  Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit. Man  We talk about bold  fresh. I think  fresh  is a great word that really spins this category into the positive  versus  fights odor and wetness.  It keeps you fresh. How do we keep you fresher longer    better freshness  more freshness  three times fresher. Things like that that are more of that positive benefit. MS  And that's a multi million dollar corporation. What about me  What about a regular guy  I need to go talk to the man on the street  the people who are like me  the regular Joes. They need to tell me about my brand. Man  Um  my brand  I don't know. I like really nice clothes. Woman    's revival meets skater punk  unless it's laundry day. MS  All right  what is brand Gerry  Gerry  Unique.  MS  Unique.  Man  I guess what kind of genre  style I am would be like dark glamor. I like a lot of black colors  a lot of grays and stuff like that. But usually I have an accessory  like sunglasses  or I like crystal and things like that too. Woman  If Dan were a brand  he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz. Man    The brand that I am is  I would call it casual fly. Woman    Part hippie  part yogi  part Brooklyn girl    I don't know. Man    I'm the pet guy. I sell pet toys all over the country  all over the world. So I guess that's my brand. In my warped little industry  that's my brand. Man    My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods. Man    Failed writer alcoholic brand. Is that something  Lawyer  I'm a lawyer brand. Tom  I'm Tom. MS  Well we can't all be brand Tom  but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly. And what I realized is I needed an expert. I needed somebody who could get inside my head  somebody who could really help me understand what they call your  brand personality.  And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg. They've helped companies like Nestle  Febreze  Hallmark discover that brand personality. If they could do it for them  surely they could do it for me. MS  I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family. A  So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are. MS  These are the people who shape the way I look at the world. A  Tell me about this world. MS  This world  I think your world is the world that you live in    like people who are around you  your friends  your family  the way you live your life  the job you do. All those things stemmed and started from one place  and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia. A  What's the next one you want to talk about  MS  The next one  This was the best day ever. A  How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are  MS  It's like  who do I want to be  I like things that are different. I like things that are weird. I like weird things. A  Tell me about the  why  phase    what does that do for us  What is the machete  What pupa stage are you in now  Why is it important to reboot  What does the red represent  Tell me a little bit about that part. ... A little more about you that is not who you are. What are some other metamorphoses that you've had  ... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on  MS  EEEEEE   A  Thank you.  No  thank you. A  Thanks for you patience.  MS  Great job.  A  Yeah.  MS  Thanks a lot.  All right. MS  Yeah  I don't know what's going to come of this. There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there. Lindsay Zaltman  The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct  but complementary sides to your brand personality    the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful play brand. Those are juxtaposed very nicely together. And I think there's almost a paradox with those. And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both. Most companies tend to    and it's human nature    to avoid things that they're not sure of  avoid fear  those elements  and you really embrace those  and you actually turn them into positives for you  and it's a neat thing to see. What other brands are like that  The first on here is the classic  Apple. And you can see here too  Target  Wii  Mini from the Mini Coopers  and JetBlue. Now there's playful brands and mindful brands  those things that have come and gone  but a playful  mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing. MS  A playful  mindful brand. What is your brand  If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity  your brand personality  what would you be  Are you an up attribute  Are you something that gets the blood flowing  Or are you more of a down attribute  Are you something that's a little more calm  reserved  conservative  Up attributes are things like being playful  being fresh like the Fresh Prince  contemporary  adventurous  edgy or daring like Errol Flynn  nimble or agile  profane  domineering  magical or mystical like Gandalf. Or are you more of a down attribute  Are you mindful  sophisticated like      Are you established  traditional  nurturing  protective  empathetic like the Oprah  Are you reliable  stable  familiar  safe  secure  sacred  contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda  Over the course of this film  we had     plus companies who were up and down companies saying   no   they didn't want any part of this project. They wanted nothing to do with this film  mainly because they would have no control  they would have no control over the final product. But we did get    brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control  who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell    stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind. They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing  as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing. We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising. In the entire city for the past five years  there's no billboards  there's no posters  there's no flyers  nothing. And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash strapped schools all across America. What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of  or I've had the most success in  are ones where I've interacted with things directly. And that's what these brands did. They cut out the middleman  they cut out their agencies and said   Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind. I'm going to deal directly with the artist. I'm going to work with him to create something different  something that's going to get people thinking  that's going to challenge the way we look at the world.  And how has that been for them  Has it been successful  Well  since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival  let's take a look. According to Burrelles  the movie premiered in January  and since then    and this isn't even the whole thing    we've had     million media impressions for this film. That's literally covering just like a two and a half week period. That's only online    no print  no TV. The film hasn't even been distributed yet. It's not even online. It's not even streaming. It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet. So ultimately  this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum. And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part. What I always believe is that if you take chances  if you take risks  that in those risks will come opportunity. I believe that when you push people away from that  you're pushing them more towards failure. I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse  then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged. I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks. We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them. Ultimately  moving forward  I think we have to embrace fear. We've got to put that bear in a cage. Embrace fear. Embrace risk. One big spoonful at a time  we have to embrace risk. And ultimately  we have to embrace transparency. Today  more than ever  a little honesty is going to go a long way. And that being said  through honesty and transparency  my entire talk   Embrace Transparency   has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC  who for        bought the naming rights on eBay. EMC  Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world. EMC presents   Embrace Transparency.  Thank you very much  guys. June Cohen  So  Morgan  in the name of transparency  what exactly happened to that         MS  That is a fantastic question. I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization  the Sapling Foundation    a check for        to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED. I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy. This guy's name is TEMPT. TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the   s. And he came up home from a run one day and said   Dad  my legs are tingling.  And that was the onset of ALS. So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. He only has use of his eyes. I was exposed to him. I have a company that does design and animation  so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony  TEMPT  and his cause. So I went and met with his brother and father and said   We're going to give you this money. What are you going to do with it   And his brother said   I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me.  And I said   Wait a second  isn't that    I've seen Stephen Hawking    don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices   And he said   No  unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance  you can't actually do that. These devices aren't accessible to people.  And I said   Well  how do you actually communicate   Has everyone seen the movie  The Diving Bell and the Butterfly   That's how they communicate    so run their finger along. I said   That's archaic. How can that be   So I showed up with the desire to just write a check  and instead  I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash. I committed to his brother and his father right then and there    I'm like   All right  here's the deal  Tony's going to speak  we're going to get him a machine  and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again. Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it.  So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that. I met these guys called GRL  Graffiti Research Lab  and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then  with a laser pointer  draw on it  and it just registers the negative space. So they go around and do art installations like this. All the things that go up there  they said there's a life cycle. First it starts with the sexual organs  then it starts with cuss words  then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art. But there was always a life cycle to their presentations. So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this  and we were like   Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things  why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again  Well that would be awesome.  So that started the journey. And about two years later  about a year later  after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around  we'd accomplished a couple things. One  we battered down the doors of the insurance companies  and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate    a Stephen Hawking machine. Which was awesome. And he's seriously one of the funniest    I call him Yoda  because you talk to the guy  you get an email from him  and you're like   I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing.  The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world    literally every corner of the world    into our house. My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage  and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house. A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls. But for over two weeks  we programmed  we went to the Venice boardwalk  my kids got involved  my dog got involved  and we created this. This is called the EyeWriter  and you can see the description. This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk  some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack. We took a PS  camera  hacked it open  mounted it to an LED light  and now there's a device that is free    you build this yourself  we publish the code for free  you download the software for free. And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations. There's no insurance company that can say  No.  There's no hospital that can say  No.  Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes. Thank you. Thank you guys very much. That was awesome. So at the end of the two weeks  we went back to TEMPT's room. I love this picture  because this is someone else's room and that's his room. So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling. And after over a year of planning  two weeks of programming  carb fest and all night sessions  Tony drew again for the first time in seven years. And this is an amazing picture  because this is his life support system  and he's looking over his life support system. We kicked his bed so that he could see out. And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital. And he drew again for the first time  in front of his family and friends    and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was. The funny thing was  we had to break into the parking lot too  so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too. So at the end of this  he sent us an email  and this is what the email said   That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years. I feel like I had been held underwater  and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe.  Isn't that awesome  So that's kind of our battle cry. That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing. And we've got such a long way to go with this. This is an amazing device  but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more. So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better  faster  stronger. Since that time  we've had all kinds of acknowledgment. We've won a bunch of awards. Remember  it's free  none of us are making any money on this thing. It's all coming out of our own pockets. So the awards were like   Oh  this is fantastic.  Armstrong Twittered about us  and then in December  Time magazine honored us as one of the top    inventions of       which was really cool. The coolest thing about this    and this is what's completing the whole circle    is that in April of this year  at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles  there's going to be an exhibition called  Art of the Streets.  And  Art of the Streets  is going to have pretty much the bad asses of the street art scene    Banksy  Shepard Fairey  KAWS    all of these guys will be there. TEMPT's going to be in the show  which is pretty awesome. So basically this is my point  If you see something that's not possible  make it possible. Everything in this room wasn't possible    this stage  this computer  this mic  the EyeWriter    wasn't possible at one point. Make it possible  everyone in this room. I'm not a programmer  never done anything with ocular recognition technology  but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen. And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done  if not now  then when  And if not me  then who  Thank you guys. Can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were     Do you know what I wanted to be  I wanted to be a biker chick. I wanted to race cars  and I wanted to be a cowgirl  and I wanted to be Mowgli from  The Jungle Book.  Because they were all about being free  the wind in your hair    just to be free. And on my seventeenth birthday  my parents  knowing how much I loved speed  gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday. Not that we could have afforded I drive  but to give me the dream of driving. And on my seventeenth birthday  I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence  as I always had all my life    my visually impaired sister    to go to see an eye specialist. Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters. And my little sister wanted to be a pilot    God help her. So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun. And on my seventeenth birthday  after my fake eye exam  the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday. And he said   So what are you going to do to celebrate   And I took that driving lesson  and I said   I'm going to learn how to drive.  And then there was a silence    one of those awful silences when you know something's wrong. And he turned to my mother  and he said   You haven't told her yet   On my seventeenth birthday  as Janis Ian would best say  I learned the truth at   . I am  and have been since birth  legally blind. And you know  how on earth did I get to    and not know that  Well  if anybody says country music isn't powerful  let me tell you this  I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song   A Boy Named Sue.  I'm the eldest of three. I was born in     . And very shortly after my birth  my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism. And what the hell does that mean to you  So let me just tell you  the great part of all of this  I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing  so holy God  woohoo   Laughter  I might buy some more time. But more importantly  let me tell you    I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out  Pat. Hey. See this hand  Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline. Every man in this room  even you  Steve  is George Clooney. And every woman  you are so beautiful. And when I want to look beautiful  I step three feet away from the mirror  and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting I've done all my life from all the dark lights. The really strange part is that  at three and a half  just before I was going to school  my parents made a bizarre  unusual and incredibly brave decision. No special needs schools. No labels. No limitations. My ability and my potential. And they decided to tell me that I could see. So just like Johnny Cash's Sue  a boy given a girl's name  I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive  when they were no longer there to protect me  or just take it all away. But more significantly  they gave me the ability to believe  totally  to believe that I could. And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things  a big fat  no   everybody imagines I was devastated. And don't get me wrong  because when I first heard it    aside from the fact that I thought he was insane    I got that thump in my chest  just that  huh   But very quickly I recovered. It was like that. The first thing I thought about was my mom  who was crying over beside me. And I swear to God  I walked out of his office   I will drive. I will drive. You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive.  And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child    he taught me how to sail  knowing I could never see where I was going  I could never see the shore  and I couldn't see the sails  and I couldn't see the destination. But he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face. And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive. And for the next    years  I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see  because I didn't want to be a failure  and I didn't want to be weak. And I believed I could do it. So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do. And I was an archeologist  and then I broke things. And then I managed a restaurant  and then I slipped on things. And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener. And then I went to business school. And you know  disabled people are hugely educated. And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture. And they didn't even know. And it's extraordinary how far belief can take you. In       two and a half years into that job  something happened. Wonderfully  my eyes decided  enough. And temporarily  very unexpectedly  they dropped. And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world  where you work hard  play hard  you gotta be the best  you gotta be the best. And two years in  I really could see very little. And I found myself in front of an HR manager in       saying something I never imagined that I would say. I was    years old. I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do. And I simply said   I'm sorry. I can't see  and I need help.  Asking for help can be incredibly difficult. And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that. We all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure. And it's frightening  isn't it  But all that belief had fueled me so long. And can I tell you  operating in the sighted world when you can't see  it's kind of difficult    it really is. Can I tell you  airports are a disaster. Oh  for the love of God. And please  any designers out there  OK  designers  please put up your hands  even though I can't even see you. I always end up in the gents' toilets. And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell. But can I just tell you  the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle. Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes  It's such a small thing  right  And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you're not  or to be somebody that you aren't  And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR  they sent me off to an eye specialist. And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life. But before I got to him  I was so lost. I had no idea who I was anymore. And that eye specialist  he didn't bother testing my eyes. God no  it was therapy. And he asked me several questions  of which many were   Why  Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself  And do you love what you do  Caroline   And you know  when you go to a global consulting firm  they put a chip in your head  and you're like   I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.   Laughter  To leave would be failure. And he said   Do you love it   I couldn't even speak I was so choked up. I just was so    how do I tell him  And then he said to me   What did you want to be when you were little   Now listen  I wasn't going to say to him   Well  I wanted to race cars and motorbikes.  Hardly appropriate at this moment in time. He thought I was mad enough anyway. And as I left his office  he called me back and he said   I think it's time. I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different.  And that door closed. And that silence just outside a doctor's office  that many of us know. And my chest ached. And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea. But I did know the game was up. And I went home  and  because the pain in my chest ached so much  I thought   I'll go out for a run.  Really not a very sensible thing to do. And I went on a run that I know so well. I know this run so well  by the back of my hand. I always run it perfectly fine. I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with. And there was a rock that I always missed. And I'd never fallen on it  never. And there I was crying away  and smash  bash on my rock. Broken  fallen over on this rock in the middle of March in       typical Irish weather on a Wednesday    gray  snot  tears everywhere  ridiculously self pitying. And I was floored  and I was broken  and I was angry. And I didn't know what to do. And I sat there for quite some time going   How am I going to get off this rock and go home  Because who am I going to be  What am I going to be   And I thought about my dad  and I thought   Good God  I'm so not Sue now.  And I kept thinking over and over in my mind  what had happened  Where did it go wrong  Why didn't I understand  And you know  the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers. I had lost my belief. Look where my belief had brought me to. And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see. I was crumpled. And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me   What do you want to be  What do you want to be  What did you want to be when you were little  Do you love what you do  Do something different. What do you want to be  Do something different. What do you want to be   And really slowly  slowly  slowly  it happened. And it did happen this way. And then the minute it came  it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart    something different.  Well  how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'  You don't get more different than that.  And the moment  and I mean the moment  the moment that hit me  I swear to God  it was like woo hoo  You know    something to believe in. And nobody can tell me no. Yes  you can say I can't be an archeologist. But you can't tell me  no  I can't be Mowgli  because guess what  Nobody's ever done it before  so I'm going to go do it. And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl  I'm just going to scoot. And so I got off that rock  and  oh my God  did I run home. And I sprinted home  and I didn't fall  and I didn't crash. And I ran up the stairs  and there was one of my favorite books of all time   Travels on My Elephant  by Mark Shand    I don't know if any of you know it. And I grabbed this book off  and I'm sitting on the couch going   I know what I'm going to do. I know how to be Mowgli. I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant. I'm going to be an elephant handler.  And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler. From global management consultant to elephant handler. I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant  get an elephant. I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue. But I knew I would. Because  when you make a decision at the right time and the right place  God  that universe makes it happen for you. Nine months later  after that day on snot rock  I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi. And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India. The most powerful thing of all  it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God  I did. But you know  I was believing in the wrong thing. Because I wasn't believing in me  really me  all the bits of me    all the bits of all of us. Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not  And you know what  when you really believe in yourself and everything about you  it's extraordinary what happens. And you know what  that trip  that thousand kilometers  it raised enough money for       cataract eye operations. Six thousand people got to see because of that. When I came home off that elephant  do you know what the most amazing part was  I chucked in my job at Accenture. I left  and I became a social entrepreneur  and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family  which deals with Asian elephant conservation. And I set up Kanchi  because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant  because disability is like the elephant in the room. And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way    no charity  no pity. But I wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible. It was extraordinary. That's what I wanted to do. And I never thought about noes anymore  or not seeing  or any of that kind of nothing. It just seemed that it was possible. And you know  the oddest part is  when I was on my way traveling here to TED  I'll be honest  I was petrified. And I speak  but this is an amazing audience  and what am I doing here  But as I was traveling here  you'll be very happy to know  I did use my white symbol stick cane  because it's really good to skip queues in the airport. And I got my way here being happily proud that I couldn't see. And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine  he texted me on the way over  knowing I was scared. Even though I present confident  I was scared. He said   Be you.  And so here I am. This is me  all of me. And I have learned  you know what  cars and motorbikes and elephants  that's not freedom. Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom. And I never needed eyes to see    never. I simply needed vision and belief. And if you truly believe    and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart    you can make change happen. And we need to make it happen  because every single one of us    woman  man  gay  straight  disabled  perfect  normal  whatever    everyone of us must be the very best of ourselves. I no longer want anybody to be invisible. We all have to be included. And stop with the labels  the limiting. Losing of labels  because we are not jam jars. We are extraordinary  different  wonderful people. Thank you. First  a video. Yes  it is a scrambled egg. But as you look at it  I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy. Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself. And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated. And now they're going to be poured back into the egg. And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works. A scrambled egg is mush    tasty mush    but it's mush. An egg is a beautiful  sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things  such as chickens. And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity. In fact  this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics  the second law of thermodynamics  or the law of entropy. What that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order  lack of structure    in fact  to mush. And that's why that video feels a bit strange. And yet  look around us. What we see around us is staggering complexity. Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone  there are some    billion SKUs  or distinct commodities  being traded. That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth. And they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals  who are linked by trade  travel  and the Internet into a global system of stupendous complexity. So here's a great puzzle  in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics  how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described  the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center  Well  the answer seems to be  the universe can create complexity  but with great difficulty. In pockets  there appear what my colleague  Fred Spier  calls  Goldilocks conditions     not too hot  not too cold  just right for the creation of complexity. And slightly more complex things appear. And where you have slightly more complex things  you can get slightly more complex things. And in this way  complexity builds stage by stage. Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe. We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments. And at each threshold  the going gets tougher. The complex things get more fragile  more vulnerable  the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent  and it's more difficult to create complexity. Now  we  as extremely complex creatures  desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law  and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility. And that's the story that we tell in big history. But to do it  you have do something that may  at first sight  seem completely impossible. You have to survey the whole history of the universe. So let's do it. Let's begin by winding the timeline back   .  billion years  to the beginning of time. Around us  there's nothing. There's not even time or space. Imagine the darkest  emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are. And then suddenly  bang  A universe appears  an entire universe. And we've crossed our first threshold. The universe is tiny  it's smaller than an atom. It's incredibly hot. It contains everything that's in today's universe  so you can imagine  it's busting. And it's expanding at incredible speed. And at first  it's just a blur  but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur. Within the first second  energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity. And energy does something else quite magical  it congeals to form matter    quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons. And all of that happens in the first second. Now we move forward         years. That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet. And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium. Now I want to pause for a moment          years after the origins of the universe  because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage. We know above all that it was extremely simple. It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms  and they have no structure. They're really a sort of cosmic mush. But that's not completely true. Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that  in fact  there are just tiny differences in that background. What you see here  the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas. These are tiny differences  but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity. And this is how it works. Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff. So where you get slightly denser areas  gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms. So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds. And each cloud is compacted  gravity gets more powerful as density increases  the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud  and then  at the center  the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of    million degrees  protons start to fuse  there's a huge release of energy  and    bam  We have our first stars. From about     million years after the Big Bang  stars begin to appear all through the universe  billions of them. And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex. Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds. When very large stars die  they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations  to form all the elements of the periodic table. If  like me  you're wearing a gold ring  it was forged in a supernova explosion. So now the universe is chemically more complex. And in a chemically more complex universe  it's possible to make more things. And what starts happening is that  around young suns  young stars  all these elements combine  they swirl around  the energy of the star stirs them around  they form particles  they form snowflakes  they form little dust motes  they form rocks  they form asteroids  and eventually  they form planets and moons. And that is how our solar system was formed  four and a half billion years ago. Rocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials. So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity. Now  the going gets tougher. The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile  significantly more vulnerable  but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity. I'm talking  of course  about living organisms. Living organisms are created by chemistry. We are huge packages of chemicals. So  chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force. That operates over smaller scales than gravity  which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets. Now  what are the ideal conditions for chemistry  What are the Goldilocks conditions  Well  first  you need energy  but not too much. In the center of a star  there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again. But not too little. In intergalactic space  there's so little energy that atoms can't combine. What you want is just the right amount  and planets  it turns out  are just right  because they're close to stars  but not too close. You also need a great diversity of chemical elements  and you need liquids  such as water. Why  Well  in gases  atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up. In solids  atoms are stuck together  they can't move. In liquids  they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules. Now  where do you find such Goldilocks conditions  Well  planets are great  and our early Earth was almost perfect. It was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water. And deep beneath those oceans  at cracks in the Earth's crust  you've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth  and you've got a great diversity of elements. So at those deep oceanic vents  fantastic chemistry began to happen  and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations. But of course  life is more than just exotic chemistry. How do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable  Well  it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick. You don't stabilize the individual  you stabilize the template  the thing that carries information  and you allow the template to copy itself. And DNA  of course  is the beautiful molecule that contains that information. You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA. Each rung contains information. So  DNA contains information about how to make living organisms. And DNA also copies itself. So  it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean. So the information spreads. Notice that information has become part of our story. The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections. As it copies itself  once in every billion rungs  there tends to be an error. And what that means is that DNA is  in effect  learning. It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work. So DNA's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity. And we can see this happening over the last four billion years. For most of that time of life on Earth  living organisms have been relatively simple    single cells. But they had great diversity  and  inside  great complexity. Then from about     to     million years ago  multi celled organisms appear. You get fungi  you get fish  you get plants  you get amphibia  you get reptiles  and then  of course  you get the dinosaurs. And occasionally  there are disasters. Sixty five million years ago  an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula  creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war  and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Terrible news for the dinosaurs  but great news for our mammalian ancestors  who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs. And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began    million years ago with the landing of an asteroid. Humans appeared about         years ago. And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story. Let me explain why. We've seen that DNA learns in a sense  it accumulates information. But it is so slow. DNA accumulates information through random errors  some of which just happen to work. But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning  it had produced organisms with brains  and those organisms can learn in real time. They accumulate information  they learn. The sad thing is  when they die  the information dies with them. Now what makes humans different is human language. We are blessed with a language  a system of communication  so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory. And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information  and it can accumulate from generation to generation. And that's why  as a species  we're so creative and so powerful  and that's why we have a history. We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift. I call this ability collective learning. It's what makes us different. We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history. We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa  but then you see humans migrating into new environments  into desert lands  into jungles  into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia    tough  tough environment    into the Americas  into Australasia. Each migration involved learning    learning new ways of exploiting the environment  new ways of dealing with their surroundings. Then        years ago  exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age  humans learned to farm. Farming was an energy bonanza. And exploiting that energy  human populations multiplied. Human societies got larger  denser  more interconnected. And then from about     years ago  humans began to link up globally through shipping  through trains  through telegraph  through the Internet  until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals. And that brain is learning at warp speed. And in the last     years  something else has happened. We've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels. So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us. So    Here we are  back at the convention center. We've been on a journey  a return journey  of   .  billion years. I hope you agree this is a powerful story. And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role. But it also contains warnings. Collective learning is a very  very powerful force  and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it. I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England  living through the Cuban Missile Crisis. For a few days  the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction. And the same weapons are still here  and they are still armed. If we avoid that trap  others are waiting for us. We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last        years. So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us  but it can also show us our power with collective learning. And now  finally    this is what I want. I want my grandson  Daniel  and his friends and his generation  throughout the world  to know the story of big history  and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us. And that's why a group of us are building a free  online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world. We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them  as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet. I thank you for your attention. How often do we hear that people just don't care  How many times have you been told that real  substantial change isn't possible because most people are too selfish  too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community  I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist  but rather  that people do care  but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way. And I'll give you some examples of what I mean. Let's start with city hall. You ever see one of these before  This is a newspaper ad. It's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what's happening. As you can see  it's impossible to read. You need to get halfway down to even find out which address they're talking about  and then farther down  in tiny    point font  to find out how to actually get involved. Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way    if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that. Now that would never happen. You'll never see an ad like that because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes. Whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process  otherwise their ads would look something like this    with all the information basically laid out clearly. As long as the city's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged  then of course people aren't going to be engaged. But that's not apathy  that's intentional exclusion. Public space. The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression. Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice  dominating the visual and mental environment. The problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren't profitable to say. So you're never going to see them on a billboard. The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change  mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals  but even when they do talk about important political issues  they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement. And I'll give you an example  the Now magazine from last week    progressive  downtown weekly in Toronto. This is the cover story. It's an article about a theater performance  and it starts with basic information about where it is  in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article    where  the time  the website. Same with this    it's a movie review  an art review  a book review    where the reading is in case you want to go. A restaurant    you might not want to just read about it  maybe you want to go to the restaurant. So they tell you where it is  what the prices are  the address  the phone number  etc. Then you get to their political articles. Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening. It talks about the candidates    written very well    but no information  no follow up  no websites for the campaigns  no information about when the debates are  where the campaign offices are. Here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign. The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat  maybe read a book  maybe see a movie  but not be engaged in their community. And you might think this is a small thing  but I think it's important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport. Heroes  How do we view leadership  Look at these    movies. What do they have in common  Anyone  They all have heroes who were chosen. Someone came up to them and said   You're the chosen one. There's a prophesy. You have to save the world.  And then someone goes off and saves the world because they've been told to  with a few people tagging along. This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about. A heroic effort is a collective effort  number one. Number two  it's imperfect  it's not very glamorous  and it doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end. It's an ongoing process your whole life. But most importantly  it's voluntary. It's voluntary. As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead  or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy  they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership  which is that it comes from within. It's about following your own dreams    uninvited  uninvited    and then working with others to make those dreams come true. Political parties  oh boy. Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics. Instead  they've become  sadly  uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing  pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas. And people can smell that  and it feeds cynicism. Charitable status  Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy. This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced  especially during election time. Which leads us to the last one  which is our elections. As you may have noticed  our elections in Canada are a complete joke. We use out of date systems that are unfair and create random results. Canada's currently led by a party that most Canadians didn't actually want. How can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don't count in Canada  You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic. It's like trying to run into a brick wall. Now I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what's in our way. Quite the opposite  I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care. But that  as I said  we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way. As long as we believe that people  our own neighbors  are selfish  stupid or lazy  then there's no hope. But we can change all those things I mentioned. We can open up city hall. We can reform our electoral systems. We can democratize our public spaces. My main message is  if we can redefine apathy  not as some kind of internal syndrome  but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement  and if we can clearly define  we can clearly identify  what those obstacles are  and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles  then anything is possible. Thank you. Roger Ebert  These are my words  but this is not my voice. This is Alex  the best computer voice I've been able to find  which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh. For most of my life  I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak. It was like breathing. In those days  I was living in a fool's paradise. After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak  eat or drink  I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me. For several days now  we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED. I used to be able to talk like that. Maybe I wasn't as smart  but I was at least as talkative. I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself  and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. However  I've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous. So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me. I will start with my wife  Chaz. Chaz Ebert  It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in       I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show  'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.' I had pre taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation. The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. My tongue  larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected. CE  I was optimistic  and all was right with the world. The first surgery was a great success. I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good. Two weeks later  I was ready to return home. I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song 'I'm Your Man' for my doctors and nurses. Suddenly  I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding. My carotid artery had ruptured. Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there. Chaz told me that if that song hadn't played for so long  I might have already been in the car  on the way home  and would have died right there and then. So thank you  Leonard Cohen  for saving my life. There was a second surgery    which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart. And then a third attempt  which also patched me back together pretty well  until it failed. A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. And before I left the hospital  after a year of being hospitalized  I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery. There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again  it just sort of became obvious. Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system. We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. Therefore  the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air. Because I had lost my jaw  I could no longer form a seal  and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless. Dean Ornish  At first for a long time  I wrote messages in notebooks. Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice. This was faster  and nobody had to try to read my handwriting. I tried out various computer voices that were available online  and for several months I had a British accent  which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.   It was the clearest I could find. Then Apple released the Alex voice  which was the best I'd heard. It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. When it saw a period  it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air. There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices  and I've experimented with them. For me  they share a fundamental problem  they're too slow. When I find myself in a conversational situation  I need to type fast and to jump right in. People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase. But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice  How does that affect who you are as a person  When people hear Alex speaking my words  do they experience a disconnect  Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next  How did I feel not being able to speak  I felt  and I still feel  a lot of distance from the human mainstream. I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop. Even then  I'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties. So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of    years. At first I was against it. I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer. There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. But I decided then to just give it a try. So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. They'd never made one from previously recorded materials. All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. But they were willing to give it a try. So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice  including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs. And it sounded like me  it really did. There was a reason for that  it was me. But it wasn't that simple. The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved    movie soundtracks  for example  or Gene Siskel arguing with me    and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough. I'll let you hear a sample of that voice. These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program. And here's the voice we call Roger Jr. or Roger  . . Roger  .   Oprah  I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show. We have been talking for a long time  and now here we are again. This is the first version of my computer voice. It still needs improvement  but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL     . When I heard it the first time  it sent chills down my spine. When I type anything  this voice will speak whatever I type. When I read something  it will read in my voice. I have typed these words in advance  as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on  Casablanca  and  Citizen Kane.  This is the first voice they've created for an individual. There are several very good voices available for computers  but they all sound like somebody else  while this voice sounds like me. I plan to use it on television  radio and the Internet. People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built in speaking systems. Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves. But I've got to say  in first grade  they said I talked too much  and now I still can. Roger Ebert  As you can hear  it sounds like me  but the words jump up and down. The flow isn't natural. The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice  and I'm optimistic about it. But so far  the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard. I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex. He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice. A very large sample is needed. John Hunter  All my life I was a motormouth. Now I have spoken my last words  and I don't even remember for sure what they were. I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled  I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.  On Wednesday  David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time span of the universe. For almost all of its millions and billions of years  there was no life on Earth at all. For almost all the years of life on Earth  there was no intelligent life. Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next  did civilization become possible. In cosmological terms  that was about    minutes ago. Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool  the computer. That has mostly happened in my lifetime. Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana  the birthplace of HAL     . When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday  about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world  I had a flashback. It was about     . As a local newspaper reporter still in high school  I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO. The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. This was a computer assisted instruction system  which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC. The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. I doubt  on that day    years ago  they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished. But that's not the point. The point is PLATO was only    years ago  an instant in time. It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers  until only five years ago. I have learned from Wikipedia that  starting with that humble beginning  PLATO established forums  message boards  online testing  email  chat rooms  picture languages  instant messaging  remote screen sharing and multiple player games. Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana  it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual  online universe we occupy today. But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce. I'm here as a man who wants to communicate. All of this has happened in my lifetime. I started writing on a computer back in the     s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun Times. I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model    's. And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections  they didn't know what I was talking about. When I bought my first desktop  it was a DEC Rainbow. Does anybody remember that    The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble. I joined CompuServe when it had fewer numbers than I currently have followers on Twitter. CE  All of this has happened in the blink of an eye. It is unimaginable what will happen next. It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history. Indeed  I am lucky to live in history at all  because without intelligence and memory there is no history. For billions of years  the universe evolved completely without notice. Now we live in the age of the Internet  which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. And because of it  I can communicate as well as I ever could. We are born into a box of time and space. We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others. For me  the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence. I cannot speak  I can only type so fast. Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated  but with my computer  I can communicate more widely than ever before. I feel as if my blog  my email  Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation. They aren't an improvement  but they're the best I can do. They give me a way to speak. Not everybody has the patience of my wife  Chaz. But online  everybody speaks at the same speed. This whole adventure has been a learning experience. Every time there was a surgery that failed  I was left with a little less flesh and bone. Now I have no jaw left at all. While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders  the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily. Ironic that my legs are fine  and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk. When you see me today  I look like the Phantom of the Opera. But no you don't. It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles. People    People talk loudly    I'm so sorry. Excuse me. People talk loudly and slowly to me. Sometimes they assume I am deaf. There are people who don't want to make eye contact. Believe me  he didn't mean this as    anyway  let me just read it. You should never let your wife read something like this. It is human nature to look away from illness. We don't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality. That's why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me. My ability to think and write have not been affected. And on the Web  my real voice finds expression. I have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way. One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes. One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple. Google him and he will make you laugh. All of these people are saying  in one way or another  that what you see is not all you get. So I have not come here to complain. I have much to make me happy and relieved. I seem  for the time being  to be cancer free. I am writing as well as ever. I am productive. If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago  I would be as isolated as a hermit. I would be trapped inside my head. Because of the rush of human knowledge  because of the digital revolution  I have a voice  and I do not need to scream. RE  Wait. I have one more thing to add. A guy goes into a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist says   You're crazy.  The guy says   I want a second opinion.  The psychiatrist says   All right  you're ugly.  You all know the test for artificial intelligence    the Turing test. A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer. If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human  the machine has passed the test. I now propose a test for computer voices    the Ebert test. If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman  then that's the voice I want. Hi  my name is Marcin    farmer  technologist. I was born in Poland  now in the U.S. I started a group called Open Source Ecology. We've identified the    most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist    things from tractors  bread ovens  circuit makers. Then we set out to create an open source  DIY  do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. We call this the Global Village Construction Set. So let me tell you a story. So I finished my   s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy  and I discovered I was useless. I had no practical skills. The world presented me with options  and I took them. I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming. I bought a tractor    then it broke. I paid to get it repaired    then it broke again. Then pretty soon  I was broke too. I realized that the truly appropriate  low cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. I needed tools that were robust  modular  highly efficient and optimized  low cost  made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime  not designed for obsolescence. I found that I would have to build them myself. So I did just that. And I tested them. And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. So then I published the  D designs  schematics  instructional videos and budgets on a wiki. Then contributors from all over the world began showing up  prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. So far  we have prototyped eight of the    machines. And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. If we can lower the barriers to farming  building  manufacturing  then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. That's not only in the developing world. Our tools are being made for the American farmer  builder  entrepreneur  maker. We've seen lots of excitement from these people  who can now start a construction business  parts manufacturing  organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear  so complete  that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit. I've planted a hundred trees in a day. I've pressed       bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days. From what I've seen  this is only the beginning. If this idea is truly sound  then the implications are significant. A greater distribution of the means of production  environmentally sound supply chains  and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity. We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. Thank you. So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers  Thomas Starzl  who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in       and Sir Roy Calne  who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K. in the following year. I returned to Singapore and  in       performed Asia's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure  but against all odds. Now when I look back  the transplant was actually the easiest part. Next  raising the money to fund the procedure. But perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators    a matter which was debated in the parliament    that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country. But    years on  my patient  Surinder  is Asia's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date. And perhaps more important  I am the proud godmother to her    year old son. But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate. The truth is  there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around. As the demand for donor organs continues to rise  in large part due to the aging population  the supply has remained relatively constant. In the United States alone          men  women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs  and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs. The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation. And the gift of life has been extended from brain dead donors to living  related donors    relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ  like a split liver graft  to a relative or loved one. But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs  the gift of life was then extended from living  related donors to now living  unrelated donors. And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy. How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from  for example  a submissive spouse  an in law  a servant  a slave  an employee  Where and how can we draw the line  In my part of the world  too many people live below the poverty line. And in some areas  the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living  unrelated donors. Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant  I received my next assignment  and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners. I was also pregnant at the time. Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life. But my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts    thoughts of walking through the prison's high security death row  as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room. And at each time  I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me. And for two years  I struggled with the dilemma of waking up at      am on a Friday morning  driving to the prison  getting down  gloved and scrubbed  ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner  remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon. No doubt  I was informed  the consent had been obtained. But  in my life  the one fulfilling skill that I had was now invoking feelings of conflict    conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk. In my team  the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience. Some of us may have been sublimated  but really none of us remained the same. I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos. And in my mind  I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence. It made me wonder if there could be a better way    a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide. Now just about that time  the practice of surgery evolved from big to small  from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures  tiny incisions. And in transplantation  concepts shifted from whole organs to cells. In       at the University of Minnesota  I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants. I witnessed the technical difficulty. And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. I thought to myself  why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas    the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes    and transplant these cells     technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ. And at that time  stem cell research had gained momentum  following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the     s. The observation that stem cells  as master cells  could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types    heart cells  liver cells  pancreatic islet cells    captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public. I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology  and this inspired a shift in my mindset  from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells. And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants. Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells. Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage  chiefly because of their pluripotency    that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types. But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells    the fact that these cells are derived from five day old human embryos    has encouraged research into other types of stem cells. Now to the ridicule of my colleagues  I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non controversial source of stem cells  adipose tissue  or fat  yes fat    nowadays available in abundant supply    you and I  I think  would be very happy to get rid of anyway. Fat derived stem cells are adult stem cells. And adult stem cells are found in you and me    in our blood  in our bone marrow  in our fat  our skin and other organs. And as it turns out  fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells. But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells. And here is the limitation  adult stem cells are mature cells  and  like mature human beings  these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types  as embryonic stem cells  can . But in       two remarkable individuals  Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States  made an astounding discovery. They discovered that adult cells  taken from you and me  could be reprogrammed back into embryonic like cells  which they termed IPS cells  or induced pluripotent stem cells. And so guess what  scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells    aging adult cells from you and me    they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells. And in our lab  we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells    cells that we may use to then form other  more specialized  cells  which one day may be used as cell transplants. If this research is successful  it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos. Indeed  there is a lot of hype  but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions. Heart disease  stroke  diabetes  spinal cord injury  muscular dystrophy  retinal eye diseases    are any of these conditions relevant  personally  to you  In May       something horrible happened to me. I was about to start a robotic operation  but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room  I realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness. Earlier that week  I had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing    yes  I fell. And I started to see floaters and stars  which I casually dismissed as too much high altitude sun exposure. What happened to me might have been catastrophic  if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access. And I had my vision restored  but not before a prolonged period of convalescence    three months    in a head down position. This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients  and especially those with retinal diseases.    million people worldwide are blind  and     million more suffer from impaired vision. Stem cell derived retinal transplants  now in a research phase  may one day restore vision  or part vision  to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide. Indeed  we live in both challenging as well as exciting times. As the world population ages  scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells. It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured  our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation. And these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue. Stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body  or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver. As we speak  there are     or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases. What lies ahead  Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.  .  million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly.  .  million suffer cardiac failure. Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function. There are     clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease. While still in a research phase  stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology. Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings    small  incremental steps  cells rather than organs  repair rather than replacement. Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs. Powerful new technologies always present enigmas. As we speak  the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval. And in the U.K.  neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial. The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers. Each one has his story. My story has been about my journey from organs to cells    a journey through controversy  inspired by hope    hope that  as we age  you and I may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life. Thank you. My students often ask me   What is sociology   And I tell them   It's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don't see.  And they say   So how can I be a sociologist  How can I understand those invisible forces   And I say   Empathy. Start with empathy. It all begins with empathy. Take yourself out of your shoes  put yourself into the shoes of another person.  Here  I'll give you an example. So I imagine my life  if a hundred years ago China had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the United States in search of coal  and they found it  and  in fact  they found lots of it right here. And pretty soon  they began shipping that coal  ton by ton  rail car by rail car  boatload by boatload  back to China and elsewhere around the world. And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so. And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal. And back here in the United States  we saw economic despair  deprivation. This is what I saw. I saw people struggling to get by  not knowing what was what and what was next. And then I asked myself the question. I say   How's it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States  because the coal is such a wealthy resource  it's so much money   And I realized  because the Chinese ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the United States who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves. And the rest of us  the vast majority of us  struggle to get by. And the Chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out against this relationship. Does this sound familiar  And they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal. And everywhere  were symbols of the Chinese    everywhere  a constant reminder. And back in China  what do they say in China  Nothing. They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal. If you ask them  they'll say   Well  you know the coal  we need the coal. I mean  come on  I'm not going to turn down my thermostat. You can't expect that.  And so I get angry  and I get pissed  as do lots of average people. And we fight back  and it gets really ugly. And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way. And before we know it  they send in the tanks and then send in the troops  and lots of people are dying  and it's a very  very difficult situation. Can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes  Can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there or a truck full of soldiers  And just imagine what you would feel. Because you know why they're here  and you know what they're doing here. And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear. If you can  that's empathy    that's empathy. You've left your shoes  and you've stood in mine. And you've got to feel that. Okay  so that's the warm up. That's the warm up. Now we're going to have the real radical experiment. And so for the remainder of my talk  what I want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim living in the Middle East    in particular  in Iraq. And so to help you  perhaps you're a member of this middle class family in Baghdad    and what you want is the best for your kids. You want your kids to have a better life. And you watch the news  you pay attention  you read the newspaper  you go down to the coffee shop with your friends  and you read the newspapers from around the world. And sometimes you even watch satellite  CNN  from the United States. So you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking. But really  you just want a better life for yourself. That's what you want. You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq. You want a better life for yourself. So here  let me help you. Let me help you with some things that you might be thinking. Number one  this incursion into your land these past    years  and before  the reason anyone is interested in your land  and particularly the United States  it's oil. It's all about oil  you know that  everybody knows that. People here back in the United States know it's about oil. It's because somebody else has a design for your resource. It's your resource  it's not somebody else's. It's your land  it's your resource. Somebody else has a design for it. And you know why they have a design  You know why they have their eyes set on it  Because they have an entire economic system that's dependent on that oil    foreign oil  oil from other parts of the world that they don't own. And what else do you think about these people  The Americans  they're rich. Come on  they live in big houses  they have big cars  they all have blond hair  blue eyes  they're happy. You think that. It's not true  of course  but that's the media impression  and that's like what you get. And they have big cities  and the cities are all dependent on oil. And back home  what do you see  Poverty  despair  struggle. Look  you don't live in a wealthy country. This is Iraq. This is what you see. You see people struggling to get by. I mean  it's not easy  you see a lot of poverty. And you feel something about this. These people have designs for your resource  and this is what you see  Something else you see that you talk about    Americans don't talk about this  but you do. There's this thing  this militarization of the world  and it's centered right in the United States. And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending    four percent of the world's population. And you feel it  you see it every day. It's part of your life. And you talk about it with your friends. You read about it. And back when Saddam Hussein was in power  the Americans didn't care about his crimes. When he was gassing the Kurds and gassing Iran  they didn't care about it. When oil was at stake  somehow  suddenly  things mattered. And what you see  something else  the United States  the hub of democracy around the world  they don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world. There are a lot of countries  oil producing countries  that aren't very democratic  but supported by the United States. That's odd. Oh  these incursions  these two wars  the    years of sanctions  the eight years of occupation  the insurgency that's been unleashed on your people  the tens of thousands  the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths  all because of oil. You can't help but think that. You talk about it. It's in the forefront of your mind always. You say   How is that possible   And this man  he's every man    your grandfather  your uncle  your father  your son  your neighbor  your professor  your student. Once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly  pain and sorrow. Everyone in your country has been touched by the violence  the bloodshed  the pain  the horror  everybody. Not a single person in your country has not been touched. But there's something else. There's something else about these people  these Americans who are there. There's something else about them that you see    they don't see themselves. And what do you see  They're Christians. They're Christians. They worship the Christian God  they have crosses  they carry Bibles. Their Bibles have a little insignia that says  U.S. Army  on them. And their leaders  their leaders  before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country    and you know the reason    before they send them off  they go to a Christian church  and they pray to their Christian God  and they ask for protection and guidance from that god. Why  Well  obviously  when people die in the war  they are Muslims  they are Iraqis    they're not Americans. You don't want Americans to die. Protect our troops. And you feel something about that    of course you do. And they do wonderful things. You read about it  you hear about it. They're there to build schools and help people  and that's what they want to do. They do wonderful things  but they also do the bad things  and you can't tell the difference. And this guy  you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin. I mean  here's a guy who says that your God is a false God. Your God's an idol  his God is the true God. The solution to the problem in the Middle East  according to him  is to convert you all to Christianity    just get rid of your religion. And you know that. Americans don't read about this guy. They don't know anything about him  but you do. You pass it around. You pass his words around. I mean this is serious. You're afraid. He was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq. And you're thinking   God  if this guy is saying that  then all the soldiers must be saying that.  And this word here  George Bush called this war a crusade. Man  the Americans  they're just like   Ah  crusade. Whatever. I don't know.  You know what it means. It's a holy war against Muslims. Look  invade  subdue them  take their resources. If they won't submit  kill them. That's what this is about. And you're thinking   My God  these Christians are coming to kill us.  This is frightening. You feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened. And this man  Terry Jones  I mean here's a guy who wants to burn Korans  right  And the Americans   Ah  he's a knucklehead. He's a former hotel manager  he's got three dozen members of his church.  They laugh him off. You don't laugh him off. Because in the context of everything else  all the pieces fit. I mean  of course  this is how Americans take it  so people all over the Middle East  not just in your country  are protesting.  He wants to burn Korans  our holy book. These Christians  who are these Christians  They're so evil  they're so mean    this is what they're about.  This is what you're thinking as an Arab Muslim  as an Iraqi. Of course you're going to think this. And then your cousin says   Hey cuz  check out this website. You've got to see this    Bible Boot Camp. These Christians are nuts. They're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus. And they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say   Sir  yes  sir   and things like grenade toss and weapons care and maintenance. And go to the website. It says  U.S. Army  right on it. I mean  these Christians  they're nuts. How would they do this to their little kids   And you're reading this website. And of course  Christians back in the United States  or anybody  says   Ah  this is some little  tiny church in the middle of nowhere.  You don't know that. For you  this is like all Christians. It's all over the Web  Bible Boot Camp. And look at this  they even teach their kids    they train them in the same way the U.S. Marines train. Isn't that interesting. And it scares you  and it frightens you. So these guys  you see them. You see  I  Sam Richards  I know who these guys are. They're my students  my friends. I know what they're thinking   You don't know.  When you see them  they're something else  they're something else. That's what they are to you. We don't see it that way in the United States  but you see it that way. So here. Of course  you got it wrong. You're generalizing. It's wrong. You don't understand the Americans. It's not a Christian invasion. We're not just there for oil  we're there for lots of reasons. You have it wrong. You've missed it. And of course  most of you don't support the insurgency  you don't support killing Americans  you don't support the terrorists. Of course you don't. Very few people do. But some of you do. And this is a perspective. Okay  so now  here's what we're going to do. Step outside of your shoes that you're in right now and step back into your normal shoes. So everyone's back in the room  okay. Now here comes the radical experiment. So we're all back home. This photo  this woman  man  I feel her. I feel her. She's my sister  my wife  my cousin  my neighbor. She's anybody to me. These guys standing there  everybody in the photo  I feel this photo  man. So here's what I want you to do. Let's go back to my first example of the Chinese. So I want you to go there. So it's all about coal  and the Chinese are here in the United States. And what I want you to do is picture her as a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag because her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising. And the soldiers are Chinese  and everybody else is Chinese. As an American  how do you feel about this picture  What do you think about that scene  Okay  try this. Bring it back. This is the scene here. It's an American  American soldiers  American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East    in Iraq or Afghanistan. Now  put yourself in the shoes  go back to the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq. What are you feeling and thinking about this photo  about this woman  Okay  now follow me on this  because I'm taking a big risk here. And so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me. These gentlemen here  they're insurgents. They were caught by the American soldiers  trying to kill Americans. And maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded. Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them. Can you feel the rage  Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks  Can you go there  It shouldn't be that difficult. You just    oh  man. Now  put yourself in their shoes. Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders  Which one  Can you feel their anger  their fear  their rage at what has happened in their country  Can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning bent down to their child and hugged their child and said   Dear  I'll be back later. I'm going out to defend your freedom  your lives. I'm going out to look out for us  the future of our country.  Can you imagine that  Can you imagine saying that  Can you go there  What do you think they're feeling  You see  that's empathy. It's also understanding. Now  you might ask   Okay  Sam  so why do you do this sort of thing  Why would you use this example of all examples   And I say  because ... because. You're allowed to hate these people. You're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being. And if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch  one tiny inch  then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life. You can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person's driving    miles per hour in the passing lane  or your teenage son  or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings. Whatever it is  you can go so far. And this is what I tell my students  step outside of your tiny  little world. Step inside of the tiny  little world of somebody else. And then do it again and do it again and do it again. And suddenly all these tiny  little worlds  they come together in this complex web. And they build a big  complex world. And suddenly  without realizing it  you're seeing the world differently. Everything has changed. Everything in your life has changed. And that's  of course  what this is about. Attend to other lives  other visions. Listen to other people  enlighten ourselves. I'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq  but as a sociologist  what I am saying is I understand. And now perhaps    perhaps    you do too. Thank you. So it's       I'm in college  and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence  Rhode Island to Portland  Oregon. And you know  we're young and unemployed  so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests    basically the longest route we can possibly take. And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota  I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for       miles.  What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road   My friend looks at me totally blankly. There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look. And I'm like   You know  all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them.  She just stares at me for a few moments  and then she cracks up  because she figures out what I'm talking about. And what I'm talking about is this. Right  the famous Chinese character for picnic area. I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this    why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us  and how we behave when that happens  and what all of this can tell us about human nature. In other words  as you heard Chris say  I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong. This might strike you as a strange career move  but it actually has one great advantage  no job competition. In fact  most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong  or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong. We get it in the abstract. We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes. The human species  in general  is fallible    okay fine. But when it comes down to me  right now  to all the beliefs I hold  here in the present tense  suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window    and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about. And the thing is  the present tense is where we live. We go to meetings in the present tense  we go on family vacations in the present tense  we go to the polls and vote in the present tense. So effectively  we all kind of wind up traveling through life  trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything. I think this is a problem. I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals  in our personal and professional lives  and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture. So what I want to do today is  first of all  talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right. And second  why it's such a problem. And finally  I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so  it is the single greatest moral  intellectual and creative leap you can make. So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right  One reason  actually  has to do with a feeling of being wrong. So let me ask you guys something    or actually  let me ask you guys something  because you're right here  How does it feel    emotionally    how does it feel to be wrong  Dreadful. Thumbs down. Embarrassing. Okay  wonderful  great. Dreadful  thumbs down  embarrassing    thank you  these are great answers  but they're answers to a different question. You guys are answering the question  How does it feel to realize you're wrong  Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things  right  I mean it can be devastating  it can be revelatory  it can actually be quite funny  like my stupid Chinese character mistake. But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything. I'll give you an analogy. Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner  In pretty much every episode of this cartoon  there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff  which is fine    he's a bird  he can fly. But the thing is  the coyote runs off the cliff right after him. And what's funny    at least if you're six years old    is that the coyote's totally fine too. He just keeps running    right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid air. That's when he falls. When we're wrong about something    not when we realize it  but before that    we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down. You know  we're already wrong  we're already in trouble  but we feel like we're on solid ground. So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago. It does feel like something to be wrong  it feels like being right. So this is one reason  a structural reason  why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness. I call this error blindness. Most of the time  we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something  until it's too late. But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well    and this one is cultural. Think back for a moment to elementary school. You're sitting there in class  and your teacher is handing back quiz papers  and one of them looks like this. This is not mine  by the way. So there you are in grade school  and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper. It's the dumb kid  the troublemaker  the one who never does his homework. So by the time you are nine years old  you've already learned  first of all  that people who get stuff wrong are lazy  irresponsible dimwits    and second of all  that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes. We learn these really bad lessons really well. And a lot of us    and I suspect  especially a lot of us in this room    deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students  perfectionists  over achievers. Right  Mr. CFO  astrophysicist  ultra marathoner  You're all CFO  astrophysicists  ultra marathoners  it turns out. Okay  so fine. Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong. Because according to this  getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us. So we just insist that we're right  because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe. So let me tell you a story. A couple of years ago  a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery. Beth Israel's in Boston. It's the teaching hospital for Harvard    one of the best hospitals in the country. So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room. She's anesthetized  the surgeon does his thing    stitches her back up  sends her out to the recovery room. Everything seems to have gone fine. And she wakes up  and she looks down at herself  and she says   Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages   Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one. When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident  he said something very interesting. He said   For whatever reason  the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient.  The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous. This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world. And when we act like it is  and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong  well that's when we end up doing things like dumping     million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico  or torpedoing the global economy. So this is a huge practical problem. But it's also a huge social problem. Think for a moment about what it means to feel right. It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality. And when you feel that way  you've got a problem to solve  which is  how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you  It turns out  most of us explain those people the same way  by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions. The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant. They don't have access to the same information that we do  and when we generously share that information with them  they're going to see the light and come on over to our team. When that doesn't work  when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us  then we move on to a second assumption  which is that they're idiots. They have all the right pieces of the puzzle  and they are too moronic to put them together correctly. And when that doesn't work  when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart  then we move on to a third assumption  they know the truth  and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. So this is a catastrophe. This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly. But to me  what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human. It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds. And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing. That is not true  and if it were  life would be incredibly boring. The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is. It's that you can see the world as it isn't. We can remember the past  and we can think about the future  and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place. And we all do this a little differently  which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this. And yeah  it is also why we get things wrong.       years before Descartes said his famous thing about  I think therefore I am   this guy  St. Augustine  sat down and wrote  Fallor ergo sum      I err therefore I am.  Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up  it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system  something we can eradicate or overcome. It's totally fundamental to who we are. Because  unlike God  we don't really know what's going on out there. And unlike all of the other animals  we are obsessed with trying to figure it out. To me  this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity. Last year  for various reasons  I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life. And so I'm listening and I'm listening  and at some point  I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong. And my first thought was   I've lost it. I've become the crazy wrongness lady. I just imagined it everywhere   which has happened. But a couple of months later  I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass  who's the host of the show. And I mentioned this to him  and he was like   No actually  that's true. In fact   he says   as a staff  we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto theme. And the crypto theme is  'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is   says Ira Glass   we need this. We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work.  And for the rest of us  audience members  as listeners  as readers  we eat this stuff up. We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings. When it comes to our stories  we love being wrong. But  you know  our stories are like this because our lives are like this. We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead. George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq  find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction  liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East. And something else happened instead. And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life  until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son. And something else happened instead. And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together. And something else happened instead. And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize. And something else happened instead. I mean  this is life. For good and for ill  we generate these incredible stories about the world around us  and then the world turns around and astonishes us. No offense  but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong. We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements  but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements  Because half the stuff that's the most mind boggling and world altering    TED         eh. Didn't really work out that way  did it  Where's my jet pack  Chris  So here we are again. And that's how it goes. We come up with another idea. We tell another story. We hold another conference. The theme of this one  as you guys have now heard seven million times  is the rediscovery of wonder. And to me  if you really want to rediscover wonder  you need to step outside of that tiny  terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say   Wow  I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.  Thank you. Thank you guys. I'm very fortunate to be here. I feel so fortunate. I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me. I called my wife Leslie  and I said   You know  there's so many good people trying to do so much good. It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels.  It's a true feeling. But let me get to the talk    I see the clock is running. I'm a public school teacher  and I just want to share a story of my superintendent. Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County  Virginia  the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. And she's a very high tech superintendent. She uses smart boards  she blogs  she Tweets  she does Facebook  she does all this sort of high tech stuff. She's a technology leader and instructional leader. But in her office  there's this old wooden  weather worn table  kitchen table    peeling green paint  it's kind of rickety. And I said   Pam  you're such a modern  cutting edge person. Why is this old table in your office   And she told me  she said   You know  I grew up in Southwestern Virginia  in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia  and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen. And we'd come in from playing  he'd come in from plowing and working  and we'd sit around that table every night. And as I grew up  I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table  I began to call it the wisdom table. And when he passed on  I took this table with me and brought it to my office  and it reminds me of him. It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes.  The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game  and essentially it is also an empty space. And I'd like to think of it as a   st century wisdom table  really. It all started back in     . I was a young man  and I had been dropping in and out of college. And my parents were very patient  but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest. And I remember the last time I came back from India    in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses    and I said to my father   Dad  I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment.  He said   Well there's one more thing you need to find.  I said   What is that  dad    A job.  And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something. So I got a degree and it turned out to be education. It was an experimental education program. It could have been dentistry  but the word  experimental  was in it  and so that's what I had to go for. And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia  the capital city  bought a three piece suit    my concession to convention    kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes    at the time it was the '  s    and I walked in  and I sat down and had an interview. And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor  her name was Anna Aro  said I had the job teaching gifted children. And I was so shocked  so stunned  I got up and said   Well  thank you  but what do I do   Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much. There weren't really many materials or things to use. And I said   What do I do   And her answer shocked me. It stunned me. Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that. She said   What do you want to do   And that question cleared the space. There was no program directive  no manual to follow  no standards in gifted education in that way. And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students  an empty space  whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding. So this happened in       and I was teaching many years later  and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker. His name is Chris Farina. Chris Farina is here today at his own cost. Chris  could you stand up and let them see you    a young  visionary filmmaker who's made a film. This film is called  World Peace and Other  th Grade Achievements.  He proposed the film to me    it's a great title. He proposed the film to me  and I said   Yeah  maybe it'll be on local TV  and we can say hi to our friends.  But the film has really gone places. Now it's still in debt  but Chris has managed  through his own sacrifice  to get this film out. So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me  more than a story about one teacher. It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers. And it's a beautiful thing. And the strange thing is  when I watch the film    I have the eerie sensation of seeing it    I saw myself literally disappear. What I saw was my teachers coming through me. I saw my geometry teacher in high school  Mr. Rucell's wry smile under his handlebar mustache. That's the smile I use    that's his smile. I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes. And they weren't flashing in anger  they were flashing in love  intense love for her students. And I have that kind of flash sometimes. And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high heels to elementary school every day. And you know  she had that old school teacher stare. You know the one.  And I'm not even talking about you behind me  because I've got eyes in the back of my head.  You know that teacher  I didn't use that stare very often  but I do have it in my repertoire. And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me. And then I saw my own parents  my first teachers. My father  very inventive  spatial thinker. That's my brother Malcolm there on the right. And my mother  who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia  who was my inspiration. And really  I feel as though  when I see the film    I have a gesture she does  like this    I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture. I am one of her teaching gestures. And the beautiful thing was  I got to teach my daughter in elementary school  Madeline. And so that gesture of my mother's continues through many generations. It's an amazing feeling to have that lineage. And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people. I'm not here alone. There are many people on this stage right now. And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about. It started out like this  it's just a four foot by five foot plywood board in an inner city urban school      . I was creating a lesson for students on Africa. We put all the problems of the world there  and I thought  let's let them solve it. I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading. I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies. So I thought  well they like to play games. I'll make something    I didn't say interactive  we didn't have that term in         but something interactive. And so we made the game  and it has since evolved to a four foot by four foot by four foot Plexiglass structure. And it has four Plexiglass layers. There's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining. There's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces  a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it    even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining. There are four countries around the board. The kids make up the names of the countries    some are rich  some are poor. They have different assets  commercial and military. And each country has a cabinet. There's a Prime Minister  Secretary of State  Minister of Defense and a CFO  or Comptroller. I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them. I offer them the job  they can turn it down  and then they choose their own cabinet. There's a World Bank  arms dealers and a United Nations. There's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather. That's not all. And then there's a    page crisis document with    interlocking problems. So that  if one thing changes  everything else changes. I throw them into this complex matrix  and they trust me because we have a deep  rich relationship together. And so with all these crises  we have    let's see    ethnic and minority tensions  we have chemical and nuclear spills  nuclear proliferation. There's oil spills  environmental disasters  water rights disputes  breakaway republics  famine  endangered species and global warming. If Al Gore is here  I'm going to send my fourth graders from Agnor Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week. And they've done it several times too. So I also have in the game a saboteur    some child    it's basically a troublemaker    and I have my troublemaker put to use because they  on the surface  are trying to save the world and their position in the game. But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game. And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies  trying to cause everyone to think more deeply. The saboteur is there  and we also read from Sun Tzu's  The Art of War.  Fourth graders understand it    nine years old    and they handle that and use that to understand how to  not follow    at first they do    the paths to power and destruction  the path to war. They learn to overlook short sighted reactions and impulsive thinking  to think in a long term  more consequential way. Stewart Brand is here  and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force. And in the game  sometimes students actually form a peace force. I'm just a clock watcher. I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator. The students run the game. I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing. So I'll just share with you ... You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world. See  Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot  and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem. John Hunter  I offered them a    Actually  I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer. And I admit the truth to them right up front  I don't know. And because I don't know  they've got to dig up the answer. And so I apologize to them as well. I say   I'm so sorry  boys and girls  but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape  and we hope you can fix it for us  and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it.  It's a sincere apology  and they take it very seriously. Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like. Well when we have the game start  here's what you see. JH  My question to you is  who's in charge of that classroom  It's a serious question  who is really in charge  I've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time. There's a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don't have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher  control every conversation and response in the classroom. It's impossible. Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine  and I admit it to them openly. So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened. In this game we had a little girl  and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation. And the Defense Minister    she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth. And she was next door to a very wealthy  oil rich neighbor. Without provocation  suddenly she attacked  against her Prime Minister's orders  the next door neighbor's oil fields. She marched into the oil field reserves  surrounded it  without firing a shot  and secured it and held it. And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up. We were all upset with her   Why are you doing this  This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you   This was a little girl and  at nine years old  she held her pieces and said   I know what I'm doing.  To her girlfriends she said that. That's a breach there. And we learned in this  you don't really ever want to cross a nine year old girl with tanks. They are the toughest opponents. And we were very upset. I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this  But come to find out  a few game days later    and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team    actually there's a negotiation period with all teams  and each team takes a turn  then we go back in negotiation  around and around  so each turn around is one game day. So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world. Had they had their fuel supplies  they would have done it. She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game. Now she used a small war to avert a larger war  so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right  conditional good  or not right. That's the kind of thinking that we put them in  the situations. I could not have designed that in teaching it. It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom. Another example  a beautiful thing happened. We have a letter in the game. If you're a military commander and you wage troops    the little plastic toys on the board    and you lose them  I put in a letter. You have to write a letter to their parents    the fictional parents of your fictional troops    explaining what happened and offering your condolences. So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat. And so we had this situation come up    last summer actually  at Agnor Hurt School in Albemarle County    and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said   Mr. Hunter  let's ask    there's a parent over there.  There was a parent visiting that day  just sitting in the back of the room.  Let's ask that mom to read the letter. It'll be more realer if she reads it.  So we did  we asked her  and she gamely picked up the letter.  Sure.  She started reading. She read one sentence. She read two sentences. By the third sentence  she was in tears. I was in tears. Everybody understood that when we lose somebody  the winners are not gloating. We all lose. And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding. I'll show you what my friend David says about this. He's been in many battles. I mean  we've been lucky  most of  the time. But now I'm feeling really weird because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week. One week he said   Those who go into battle and win will want to go back  and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win.  And so I've been winning battles  so I'm going into battles  more battles. And I think it's sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said. JH  I get chills every time I see that. That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen. And I can't design that  I can't plan that  and I can't even test that. But it's self evident assessment. We know that's an authentic assessment of learning. We have a lot of data  but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on. So I'll just share a third story. This is about my friend Brennan. We had played the game one session after school for many weeks  about seven weeks  and we had essentially solved all    of the interlocking crises. The way the game is won is all    problems have to be solved and every country's asset value has to be increased above its starting point. Some are poor  some are wealthy. There are billions. The World Bank president was a third grader one time. He says   How many zeros in a trillion  I've got to calculate that right away.  But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him. So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer. There was no way they could win. And we were approaching four o'clock  our cut off time    there was about a minute left    and despair just settled over the room. I thought  I'm failing as a teacher. I should have gotten it so they could have won. They shouldn't be failing like this. I've failed them. And I was just feeling so sad and dejected. And suddenly  Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell  the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets  and he ran back to his seat  rang the bell. Everybody ran to his chair  there was screaming  there was yelling  waving of their dossiers. They get these dossiers full of secret documents. They were gesticulating  they were running around. I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom. Principal walks in  I'm out of a job. The parents were looking in the window. And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat. He rings the bell again. He says   We have     and there's    seconds left on the clock     we have  all nations  pooled all our funds together. And we've got     billion dollars. We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country. And if they accept it  it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game. Will you accept it   And there are three seconds left on the clock. Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country  and he says   Yes.  And the game is won. Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for  that was unexpected and unpredictable. Every game we play is different. Some games are more about social issues  some are more about economic issues. Some games are more about warfare. But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human. I allow them to go there and  through their own experience  learn  in a bloodless way  how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing. And they find out what is right their own way  their own selves. And so in this game  I've learned so much from it  but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world  they may save us all. If only. And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I'm standing  thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon  which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it. My own interest in this subject  and my passion for it  began rather accidentally. I had bought a copy of this book   The Universe and Dr. Einstein     a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle. A few years after that  in Bangalore  I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night  and I picked up this book  thinking it would put me to sleep in    minutes. And as it happened  I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot. And I was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do. And that feeling hasn't left me yet. That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career    from being a software engineer to become a science writer    so that I could partake in the joy of science  and also the joy of communicating it to others. And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts  to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes  detectors  instruments that people are building  or have built  in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail. So it took me from places like Chile    the Atacama Desert in Chile    to Siberia  to underground mines in the Japanese Alps  in Northern America  all the way to Antarctica and even to the South Pole. And today I would like to share with you some images  some stories of these trips. I have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting  literally at times  their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe. And I first begin with a pie chart    and I promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation    but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos. All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter    the stuff that we're all made of    and that's four percent of the universe. Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe  which makes up    percent of the universe  and something called dark energy  which permeates the fabric of space time  that makes up another    percent. So if you look at this pie chart     percent of the universe  at this point in our exploration of it  is unknown or not well understood. And most of the experiments  telescopes that I went to see are in some way addressing this question  these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter. And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors. And the reason why they have to go underground is that  if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth  the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays  ambient radio activity  even our own bodies. You might not believe it  but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment. So they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector. And I went to see one of these experiments  and this is actually    you can barely see it  and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there    this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in     . And physicists came and started using it sometime in the     s. And the miners in the early part of the last century worked  literally  in candlelight. And today  you would see this inside the mine  half a mile underground. This is one of the largest underground labs in the world. And  among other things  they're looking for dark matter. There is another way to search for dark matter  which is indirectly. If dark matter exists in our universe  in our galaxy  then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about    one of them being neutrinos. And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules. When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light  a flash of blue light  and by looking for this blue light  you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then  indirectly  something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino. But you need very  very large volumes of water in order to do this. You need something like tens of megatons of water    almost a gigaton of water    in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino. And where in the world would you find such water  Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard. This is Lake Baikal. It is the largest lake in the world. It's     km long. It's about    to    km wide in most places  and one to two kilometers deep. And what the Russians are doing is they're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light. And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there. This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter. The lake is entirely frozen. And the line of black dots that you see in the background  that's the ice camp where the physicists are working. The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring  which  if they did that  they would need ships and submersibles to do their work. So they wait until winter    the lake is completely frozen over    and they use this meter thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work. So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter. They have to drill holes in the ice  dive down into the water    cold  cold water    to get hold of the instrument  bring it up  do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do  put it back and get out before the ice melts. Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it's full of cracks. And you have to imagine  there's an entire sea like lake underneath  moving. I still don't understand this one Russian man working in his bare chest  but that tells you how hard he was working. And these people  a handful of people  have been working for    years  looking for particles that may or may not exist. And they have dedicated their lives to it. And just to give you an idea  they have spent    million over    years. It's very harsh conditions. They work on a shoestring budget. The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack. And it's that basic  but they do this every year. From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile  to see something called The Very Large Telescope. The Very Large Telescope is one of these things that astronomers do    they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively. I can tell you for a fact  that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope. And you wouldn't believe it  but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. But nonetheless  it's an extraordinary piece of engineering. These are four  .  meter telescopes. And these telescopes  among other things  they're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time. And the more you understand that  the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about. And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror. Each mirror  there are four of them  is made of a single piece of glass  a monolithic piece of high tech ceramic  that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is  to  imagine a city like Paris  with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower  if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy  you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high. And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured. An extraordinary set of telescopes. Here's another view of the same. The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert. The dry air is really good for telescopes  and also  the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about     days of clear skies. Finally  I want to take you to Antarctica. I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world. This is cosmology's final frontier. Some of the most amazing experiments  some of the most extreme experiments  are being done in Antarctica. I was there to view something called a long duration balloon flight  which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere  the upper stratosphere     km up. And that's where they do their experiments  and then the balloon  the payload  is brought down. So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. That's an American C    cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to McMurdo in Antarctica. And here we are about to board our bus. And I don't know if you can read the lettering  but it says   Ivan the Terribus.  And that's taking us to McMurdo. And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo. And you barely might be able to make out this hut here. This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole. Because it's so cold  the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it  with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there. It's an extraordinary place. This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer  and about     in winter when it's completely dark for six months. I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument. This is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper stratosphere to an altitude of    km. What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight. So you're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of    km. And the engineers  the technicians  the physicists have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf  because Antarctica    I won't go into the reasons why    but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches  except for the weather. The weather  as you can imagine  this is summer  and you're standing on     ft of ice. And there's a volcano behind  which has glaciers at the very top. And what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon    the fabric  parachute and everything    on the ice and then fill it up with helium. And that process takes about two hours. And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly. For instance  here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind  which is eventually going to be filled up with helium. Those two trucks you see at the very end carry    tanks each of compressed helium. Now  in case the weather changes before the launch  they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station. And this particular balloon  because it has to launch two tons of weight  is an extremely huge balloon. The fabric alone weighs two tons. In order to minimize the weight  it's very thin  it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper. And if they have to pack it back  they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again    except  when they did it first  it would have been done in Texas. Here  they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing  so they have to take their shoes off  get barefoot into the boxes  in this cold  and do that kind of work. That's the kind of dedication these people have. Here's the balloon being filled up with helium  and you can see it's a gorgeous sight. Here's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end to end. So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left hand side  and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute  and then the parachute is then connected to the payload. And remember  all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold  in sub zero temperatures. They're wearing about    kg of clothing and stuff  but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that. And I would like to share with you a launch. release the balloon  release the balloon. Anil Ananthaswamy  And I'll finally like to leave you with two images. This is an observatory in the Himalayas  in Ladakh in India. And the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right hand side. And on the far left there is a     year old Buddhist monastery. This is a close up of the Buddhist monastery. And I was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has. One is exploring the cosmos on the outside  and the other one is exploring our interior being. And both require silence of some sort. And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes  the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence  whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever. And it was very obvious that  if we destroy these silent places on Earth  we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards  because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space. Thank you. Imagine a big explosion as you climb through       ft. Imagine a plane full of smoke. Imagine an engine going clack  clack  clack. It sounds scary. Well  I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in  D. I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants. So I looked at them right away  and they said   No problem. We probably hit some birds.  The pilot had already turned the plane around  and we weren't that far. You could see Manhattan. Two minutes later  three things happened at the same time. The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River. That's usually not the route. He turns off the engines. Now  imagine being in a plane with no sound. And then he says three words. The most unemotional three words I've ever heard. He says   Brace for impact.  I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. I could see in her eyes  it was terror. Life was over. Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day. I learned that it all changes in an instant. We have this bucket list  we have these things we want to do in life  and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't  all the fences I wanted to mend  all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did. As I thought about that later on  I came up with a saying  which is   I collect bad wines.  Because if the wine is ready and the person is there  I'm opening it. I no longer want to postpone anything in life. And that urgency  that purpose  has really changed my life. The second thing I learned that day    and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge  which was by not a lot    I thought about  wow  I really feel one real regret. I've lived a good life. In my own humanity and mistakes  I've tried to get better at everything I tried. But in my humanity  I also allow my ego to get in. And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter. And I thought about my relationship with my wife  with my friends  with people. And after  as I reflected on that  I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. It's not perfect  but it's a lot better. I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. It feels great. I no longer try to be right  I choose to be happy. The third thing I learned    and this is as your mental clock starts going             .  You can see the water coming. I'm saying   Please blow up.  I don't want this thing to break in    pieces like you've seen in those documentaries. And as we're coming down  I had a sense of  wow  dying is not scary. It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives. But it was very sad. I didn't want to go  I love my life. And that sadness really framed in one thought  which is  I only wish for one thing. I only wish I could see my kids grow up. About a month later  I was at a performance by my daughter    first grader  not much artistic talent    Yet  And I'm bawling  I'm crying  like a little kid. And it made all the sense in the world to me. I realized at that point  by connecting those two dots  that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad. Above all  above all  the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad. I was given the gift of a miracle  of not dying that day. I was given another gift  which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently. I challenge you guys that are flying today  imagine the same thing happens on your plane    and please don't    but imagine  and how would you change  What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever  How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them  And more than anything  are you being the best parent you can  Thank you. How would you like to be better than you are  Suppose I said that  with just a few changes in your genes  you could get a better memory    more precise  more accurate and quicker. Or maybe you'd like to be more fit  stronger  with more stamina. Would you like to be more attractive and self confident  How about living longer with good health  Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity. Which one would you like the most  Which would you like  if you could have just one  Creativity. How many people would choose creativity  Raise your hands. Let me see. A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here. How many would opt for memory  Quite a few more. How about fitness  A few less. What about longevity  Ah  the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor. If you could have any one of these  it would be a very different world. Is it just imaginary  Or  is it  perhaps  possible  Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference  but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject. The great   th century geneticist  T.G. Dobzhansky  who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church  once wrote an essay that he titled  Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution.  Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution  this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid  take out your personal communications device    I give you permission    and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong  because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. But if you do accept biological evolution  consider this  is it just about the past  or is it about the future  Does it apply to others  or does it apply to us  This is another look at the tree of life. In this picture  I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions  because if you look at the edges of the tree of life  every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms  it has survived  it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment. The human part of this branch  way out on one end  is  of course  the one that we are most interested in. We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago. In the interval  there have been perhaps    or    different species of hominids. Some have come and gone. We have been here for about         years. It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life  but actually  for the most part  the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same. Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics  This is not like human insulin  this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas. And speaking of bacteria  do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body  Maybe    times more. I mean think of it  when Antonio Damasio asks about your self image  do you think about the bacteria  Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria. It's warm  it's dark  it's moist  it's very cozy. And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part. It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria  with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit. But otherwise  you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria  just as they are essential to your life. They help in the digestion of essential nutrients  and they protect you against certain diseases. But what will come in the future  Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species  Or  are we destined to become something different    something  perhaps  even better adapted to the environment  Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang     billion years ago    the Earth  the solar system  about four and a half billion years    the first signs of proto life  maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth    the first multi celled organisms  perhaps as much as     or a billion years ago    and then the human species  finally emerging in the last         years. In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe  life on Earth is like a brief measure  the animal kingdom  like a single measure  and human life  a small grace note. That was us. That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk  so I hope you enjoyed it. Now when I was a freshman in college  I took my first biology class. I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology. I became enamored of the power of evolution  and I realized something very fundamental  in most of the existence of life in single celled organisms  each cell simply divides  and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. But at the time multi celled organisms come online  things start to change. Sexual reproduction enters the picture. And very importantly  with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome  the rest of the body becomes expendable. In fact  you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction. Now I have to confess  when I was a college undergraduate  I thought  okay  sex death  sex death  death for sex    it seemed pretty reasonable at the time  but with each passing year  I've come to have increasing doubts. I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns  who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his   s. And one night  there's a knock at his hotel room door. He answers the door. Standing before him is a gorgeous  scantily clad showgirl. She looks at him and says   I'm here for super sex.   That's fine   says George   I'll take the soup.  I came to realize  as a physician  that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution    not necessarily contradictory  just different. I was trying to preserve the body. I wanted to keep us healthy. I wanted to restore health from disease. I wanted us to live long and healthy lives. Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation  adapting and surviving through generation after generation. From an evolutionary point of view  you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea. I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said   I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying.  Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest lived. It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest  and not even the smartest. Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. That is the sole test of survival and success. At the bottom of the ocean  bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce  if fish were there  sous vide cooked fish  nevertheless  have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them. So what does this mean  as we look back at what has happened in evolution  and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution  and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase  I would say that there are a number of possibilities. The first is that we will not evolve. We have reached a kind of equipoise. And the reasoning behind that would be  first  we have  through medicine  managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population. And secondly  we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it. And by the way  we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place. A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind  natural  imposed by the forces of nature. And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly  but they are inexorable. And as far as isolation goes  when we as a species do colonize distant planets  there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way. But there's a third possibility  an enticing  intriguing and frightening possibility. I call it neo evolution    the new evolution that is not simply natural  but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make. Now how could this come about  How could it be possible that we would do this  Consider  first  the reality that people today  in some cultures  are making choices about their offspring. They're  in some cultures  choosing to have more males than females. It's not necessarily good for the society  but it's what the individual and the family are choosing. Think also  if it were possible ever for you to choose  not simply to choose the sex of your child  but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases. What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke  Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes  If we look ahead  these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible. The Human Genome Project started in       and it took    years. It cost  .  billion dollars. The year after it was finished in       you could do the same job for    million dollars in three to four months. Today  you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about        dollars and in the space of about a week. It won't be very long before the reality will be the       dollar human genome  and it will be increasingly available for everyone. Just a week ago  the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer  two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way    what Frances Arnold calls  directed evolution.  A couple of years ago  the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell  a fibroblast  and by manipulating just four genes  he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell    a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body. These changes are coming. The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves  but induce immunity against other viruses. Believe it or not  there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant. Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco  These are all reality today  and  in  the future  will be evermore possible. Imagine then just two other little changes. You can change the cells in your body  but what if you could change the cells in your offspring  What if you could change the sperm and the ova  or change the newly fertilized egg  and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life    eliminate the diabetes  eliminate the hemophilia  reduce the risk of cancer  Who doesn't want healthier children  And then  that same analytic technology  that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease  will also enable us to adopt super attributes  hyper capacities    that better memory. Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings  especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine  Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer  Why not live longer  These will be irresistible. And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation  and we can adopt the attributes we want  we will have converted old style evolution into neo evolution. We'll take a process that normally might require         years  and we can compress it down to a thousand years    and maybe even in the next     years. These are choices that your grandchildren  or their grandchildren  are going to have before them. Will we use these choices to make a society that is better  that is more successful  that is kinder  Or  will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us  Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform  or more robust and more versatile  These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face. And most profoundly of all  will we ever be able to develop the wisdom  and to inherit the wisdom  that we'll need to make these choices wisely  For better or worse  and sooner than you may think  these choices will be up to us. Thank you. So security is two different things  it's a feeling  and it's a reality. And they're different. You could feel secure even if you're not. And you can be secure even if you don't feel it. Really  we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word. And what I want to do in this talk is to split them apart    figuring out when they diverge and how they converge. And language is actually a problem here. There aren't a lot of good words for the concepts we're going to talk about. So if you look at security from economic terms  it's a trade off. Every time you get some security  you're always trading off something. Whether this is a personal decision    whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home    or a national decision    where you're going to invade some foreign country    you're going to trade off something  either money or time  convenience  capabilities  maybe fundamental liberties. And the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer  but whether it's worth the trade off. You've heard in the past several years  the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is not in power. That might be true  but it's not terribly relevant. The question is  was it worth it  And you can make your own decision  and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it. That's how you think about security    in terms of the trade off. Now there's often no right or wrong here. Some of us have a burglar alarm system at home  and some of us don't. And it'll depend on where we live  whether we live alone or have a family  how much cool stuff we have  how much we're willing to accept the risk of theft. In politics also  there are different opinions. A lot of times  these trade offs are about more than just security  and I think that's really important. Now people have a natural intuition about these trade offs. We make them every day    last night in my hotel room  when I decided to double lock the door  or you in your car when you drove here  when we go eat lunch and decide the food's not poison and we'll eat it. We make these trade offs again and again  multiple times a day. We often won't even notice them. They're just part of being alive  we all do it. Every species does it. Imagine a rabbit in a field  eating grass  and the rabbit's going to see a fox. That rabbit will make a security trade off   Should I stay  or should I flee   And if you think about it  the rabbits that are good at making that trade off will tend to live and reproduce  and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve. So you'd think that us  as a successful species on the planet    you  me  everybody    would be really good at making these trade offs. Yet it seems  again and again  that we're hopelessly bad at it. And I think that's a fundamentally interesting question. I'll give you the short answer. The answer is  we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality. Now most of the time  that works. Most of the time  feeling and reality are the same. Certainly that's true for most of human prehistory. We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense. One way to think of it is that we're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the East African highlands in         B.C.      New York  not so much. Now there are several biases in risk perception. A lot of good experiments in this. And you can see certain biases that come up again and again. So I'll give you four. We tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks    so flying versus driving. The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar. One example would be  people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common. This is for children. Third  personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks    so Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name. And the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don't control. So once you take up skydiving or smoking  you downplay the risks. If a risk is thrust upon you    terrorism was a good example    you'll overplay it because you don't feel like it's in your control. There are a bunch of other of these biases  these cognitive biases  that affect our risk decisions. There's the availability heuristic  which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind. So you can imagine how that works. If you hear a lot about tiger attacks  there must be a lot of tigers around. You don't hear about lion attacks  there aren't a lot of lions around. This works until you invent newspapers. Because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks. I tell people  if it's in the news  don't worry about it. Because by definition  news is something that almost never happens. When something is so common  it's no longer news    car crashes  domestic violence    those are the risks you worry about. We're also a species of storytellers. We respond to stories more than data. And there's some basic innumeracy going on. I mean  the joke  One  Two  Three  Many  is kind of right. We're really good at small numbers. One mango  two mangoes  three mangoes         mangoes          mangoes    it's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot. So one half  one quarter  one fifth    we're good at that. One in a million  one in a billion    they're both almost never. So we have trouble with the risks that aren't very common. And what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality. And the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack  they get different. Now you either have a feeling    you feel more secure than you are. There's a false sense of security. Or the other way  and that's a false sense of insecurity. I write a lot about  security theater   which are products that make people feel secure  but don't actually do anything. There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure  but doesn't make us feel secure. Maybe it's what the CIA's supposed to do for us. So back to economics. If economics  if the market  drives security  and if people make trade offs based on the feeling of security  then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure. And there are two ways to do this. One  you can make people actually secure and hope they notice. Or two  you can make people just feel secure and hope they don't notice. So what makes people notice  Well a couple of things  understanding of the security  of the risks  the threats  the countermeasures  how they work. But if you know stuff  you're more likely to have your feelings match reality. Enough real world examples helps. Now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood  because we live there  and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality. Security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly. Okay  so what makes people not notice  Well  a poor understanding. If you don't understand the risks  you don't understand the costs  you're likely to get the trade off wrong  and your feeling doesn't match reality. Not enough examples. There's an inherent problem with low probability events. If  for example  terrorism almost never happens  it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter terrorist measures. This is why you keep sacrificing virgins  and why your unicorn defenses are working just great. There aren't enough examples of failures. Also  feelings that are clouding the issues    the cognitive biases I talked about earlier  fears  folk beliefs  basically an inadequate model of reality. So let me complicate things. I have feeling and reality. I want to add a third element. I want to add model. Feeling and model in our head  reality is the outside world. It doesn't change  it's real. So feeling is based on our intuition. Model is based on reason. That's basically the difference. In a primitive and simple world  there's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality. You don't need a model. But in a modern and complex world  you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face. There's no feeling about germs. You need a model to understand them. So this model is an intelligent representation of reality. It's  of course  limited by science  by technology. We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them. It's limited by our cognitive biases. But it has the ability to override our feelings. Where do we get these models  We get them from others. We get them from religion  from culture  teachers  elders. A couple years ago  I was in South Africa on safari. The tracker I was with grew up in Kruger National Park. He had some very complex models of how to survive. And it depended on if you were attacked by a lion or a leopard or a rhino or an elephant    and when you had to run away  and when you couldn't run away  and when you had to climb a tree    when you could never climb a tree. I would have died in a day  but he was born there  and he understood how to survive. I was born in New York City. I could have taken him to New York  and he would have died in a day. Because we had different models based on our different experiences. Models can come from the media  from our elected officials. Think of models of terrorism  child kidnapping  airline safety  car safety. Models can come from industry. The two I'm following are surveillance cameras  ID cards  quite a lot of our computer security models come from there. A lot of models come from science. Health models are a great example. Think of cancer  of bird flu  swine flu  SARS. All of our feelings of security about those diseases come from models given to us  really  by science filtered through the media. So models can change. Models are not static. As we become more comfortable in our environments  our model can move closer to our feelings. So an example might be  if you go back     years ago when electricity was first becoming common  there were a lot of fears about it. I mean  there were people who were afraid to push doorbells  because there was electricity in there  and that was dangerous. For us  we're very facile around electricity. We change light bulbs without even thinking about it. Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into. It hasn't changed as we were growing up. And we're good at it. Or think of the risks on the Internet across generations    how your parents approach Internet security  versus how you do  versus how our kids will. Models eventually fade into the background. Intuitive is just another word for familiar. So as your model is close to reality  and it converges with feelings  you often don't know it's there. So a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu. When swine flu first appeared  the initial news caused a lot of overreaction. Now it had a name  which made it scarier than the regular flu  even though it was more deadly. And people thought doctors should be able to deal with it. So there was that feeling of lack of control. And those two things made the risk more than it was. As the novelty wore off  the months went by  there was some amount of tolerance  people got used to it. There was no new data  but there was less fear. By autumn  people thought the doctors should have solved this already. And there's kind of a bifurcation    people had to choose between fear and acceptance    actually fear and indifference    they kind of chose suspicion. And when the vaccine appeared last winter  there were a lot of people    a surprising number    who refused to get it    as a nice example of how people's feelings of security change  how their model changes  sort of wildly with no new information  with no new input. This kind of thing happens a lot. I'm going to give one more complication. We have feeling  model  reality. I have a very relativistic view of security. I think it depends on the observer. And most security decisions have a variety of people involved. And stakeholders with specific trade offs will try to influence the decision. And I call that their agenda. And you see agenda    this is marketing  this is politics    trying to convince you to have one model versus another  trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings  marginalizing people with models you don't like. This is not uncommon. An example  a great example  is the risk of smoking. In the history of the past    years  the smoking risk shows how a model changes  and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like. Compare that to the secondhand smoke debate    probably about    years behind. Think about seat belts. When I was a kid  no one wore a seat belt. Nowadays  no kid will let you drive if you're not wearing a seat belt. Compare that to the airbag debate    probably about    years behind. All examples of models changing. What we learn is that changing models is hard. Models are hard to dislodge. If they equal your feelings  you don't even know you have a model. And there's another cognitive bias I'll call confirmation bias  where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs. So evidence against our model  we're likely to ignore  even if it's compelling. It has to get very compelling before we'll pay attention. New models that extend long periods of time are hard. Global warming is a great example. We're terrible at models that span    years. We can do to the next harvest. We can often do until our kids grow up. But    years  we're just not good at. So it's a very hard model to accept. We can have both models in our head simultaneously  right  that kind of problem where we're holding both beliefs together  right  the cognitive dissonance. Eventually  the new model will replace the old model. Strong feelings can create a model. September   th created a security model in a lot of people's heads. Also  personal experiences with crime can do it  personal health scare  a health scare in the news. You'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists. They can create a model instantaneously  because they're very emotive. So in the technological world  we don't have experience to judge models. And we rely on others. We rely on proxies. I mean  this works as long as it's to correct others. We rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe. I flew here yesterday. I didn't check the airplane. I relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly. We're here  none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us  not because we checked  but because we're pretty sure the building codes here are good. It's a model we just accept pretty much by faith. And that's okay. Now  what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models    have it reflected in their feelings    to allow them to make security trade offs. Now when these go out of whack  you have two options. One  you can fix people's feelings  directly appeal to feelings. It's manipulation  but it can work. The second  more honest way is to actually fix the model. Change happens slowly. The smoking debate took    years  and that was an easy one. Some of this stuff is hard. I mean really though  information seems like our best hope. And I lied. Remember I said feeling  model  reality  I said reality doesn't change. It actually does. We live in a technological world  reality changes all the time. So we might have    for the first time in our species    feeling chases model  model chases reality  reality's moving    they might never catch up. We don't know. But in the long term  both feeling and reality are important. And I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this.         I don't know if people will remember this    there was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings in the United States. It's a horrific story. Someone took a bottle of Tylenol  put poison in it  closed it up  put it back on the shelf. Someone else bought it and died. This terrified people. There were a couple of copycat attacks. There wasn't any real risk  but people were scared. And this is how the tamper proof drug industry was invented. Those tamper proof caps  that came from this. It's complete security theater. As a homework assignment  think of    ways to get around it. I'll give you one  a syringe. But it made people feel better. It made their feeling of security more match the reality. Last story  a few years ago  a friend of mine gave birth. I visit her in the hospital. It turns out when a baby's born now  they put an RFID bracelet on the baby  put a corresponding one on the mother  so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward  an alarm goes off. I said   Well  that's kind of neat. I wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals.  I go home  I look it up. It basically never happens. But if you think about it  if you are a hospital  and you need to take a baby away from its mother  out of the room to run some tests  you better have some good security theater  or she's going to rip your arm off. So it's important for us  those of us who design security  who look at security policy  or even look at public policy in ways that affect security. It's not just reality  it's feeling and reality. What's important is that they be about the same. It's important that  if our feelings match reality  we make better security trade offs. Thank you. I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials. I brought along with me an abalone shell. This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's    percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein. Yet  it's       times tougher than its geological counterpart. And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells  like chalk. I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials  and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job. Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure  but they're formed at the nanoscale. They're formed at the nanoscale  and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures. So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non living structures  like batteries and like solar cells  What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did  in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure  using non toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment  So that's the vision that I've been thinking about. And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish  Or  what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time  and do so in an environmentally friendly way  And so  going back to this abalone shell  besides being nano structured  one thing that's fascinating  is when a male and a female abalone get together  they pass on the genetic information that says   This is how to build an exquisite material. Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure  using non toxic materials.  Same with diatoms  which are shown right here  which are glasseous structures. Every time the diatoms replicate  they give the genetic information that says   Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano structured. And you can do it the same  over and over again.  So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery  I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old. But anyone who's ever had  or knows  small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms. And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do  it's very difficult. So when we think about future technologies  we actually think of using bacteria and virus  simple organisms. Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox  so that they can build a structure that will be important to me  Also  when we think about future technologies  we start with the beginning of Earth. Basically  it took a billion years to have life on Earth. And very rapidly  they became multi cellular  they could replicate  they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source. But it wasn't until about     million years ago    during the Cambrian geologic time period    that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials. Before that  they were all soft  fluffy structures. And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment  and organisms learned how to make hard materials. And so that's what I would like be able to do    convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table. Now if you look at biology  there's many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you've heard about that are already nano structured. So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale. What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV  But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us  So here are some examples  these are some natural shells. There are natural biological materials. The abalone shell here    and if you fracture it  you can look at the fact that it's nano structured. There's diatoms made out of SIO   and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small  single domain magnets used for navigation. What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale  and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures. Now  going back to the abalone shell  the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins. These proteins are very negatively charged. And they can pull calcium out of the environment  put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate  calcium and carbonate. It has the chemical sequences of amino acids  which says   This is how to build the structure. Here's the DNA sequence  here's the protein sequence in order to do it.  And so an interesting idea is  what if you could take any material that you wanted  or any element on the periodic table  and find its corresponding DNA sequence  then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure  but not build an abalone shell    build something that  through nature  it has never had the opportunity to work with yet. And so here's the periodic table. And I absolutely love the periodic table. Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT  I have a periodic table made that says   Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element.  And you flip it over  and it's the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges. And so I give this out to thousands of people. And I know it says MIT  and this is Caltech  but I have a couple extra if people want it. And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT  and I really wanted to give him a periodic table. So I stayed up at night  and I talked to my husband   How do I give President Obama a periodic table  What if he says  'Oh  I already have one ' or  'I've already memorized it'    Laughter  And so he came to visit my lab and looked around    it was a great visit. And then afterward  I said   Sir  I want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight.  And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass. And so he looked at it  and he said   Thank you. I'll look at it periodically.  And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy  he pulled it out and said   And people at MIT  they give out periodic tables.  So basically what I didn't tell you is that about     million years ago  organisms starter making materials  but it took them about    million years to get good at it. It took them about    million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell. And that's a hard sell to a graduate student.  Laughter   I have this great project       million years.  And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly. And so we use a virus that's a non toxic virus called M   bacteriophage that's job is to infect bacteria. Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it. And by doing that  it allows the virus to express random protein sequences. And this is pretty easy biotechnology. And you could basically do this a billion times. And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical  but they differ from each other based on their tips  on one sequence that codes for one protein. Now if you take all billion viruses  and you can put them in one drop of liquid  you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table. And through a process of selection evolution  you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you'd like it to do  like grow a battery or grow a solar cell. So basically  viruses can't replicate themselves  they need a host. Once you find that one out of a billion  you infect it into a bacteria  and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence. And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales. And these viruses are long and skinny  and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries. Now this is a high powered battery that we grew in my lab. We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes. So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube. The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery. And then it wires itself to the current collector. And so through a process of selection evolution  we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record breaking  high powered battery that's all made at room temperature  basically at the bench top. And that battery went to the White House for a press conference. I brought it here. You can see it in this case    that's lighting this LED. Now if we could scale this  you could actually use it to run your Prius  which is my dream    to be able to drive a virus powered car. But it's basically    you can pull one out of a billion. You can make lots of amplifications to it. Basically  you make an amplification in the lab  and then you get it to self assemble into a structure like a battery. We're able to do this also with catalysis. This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water. And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna  and you get an energy transfer across the virus. And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels. And I brought an example with me of that today. My students promised me it would work. These are virus assembled nanowires. When you shine light on them  you can see them bubbling. In this case  you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out. And basically  by controlling the genes  you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance. The last example are solar cells. You can also do this with solar cells. We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them    and use as a way of getting electrons through the device. And what we've found is through genetic engineering  we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye sensitized systems. And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward. So this is a virus based solar cell. Through evolution and selection  we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an    percent efficiency solar cell. So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great  interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials    and taking it the next step to see if you can force  or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials  to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making. Thank you. So for the past year and a half  my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature length interactive book. It's called  Our Choice  and the author is Al Gore. It's the sequel to  An Inconvenient Truth   and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. The book starts like this. This is the cover. As the globe spins  we can see our location  and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. Or  we can scroll through the pages at the bottom. And if we wanted to zoom into a page  we can just open it up. And anything you see in the book  you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. And if you want to go back and read the book again  you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. And so this works the same way  you pick it up and pop it open. among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. Mike Matas  And so throughout the whole book  Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. This photo  you can you can even see on an interactive map. Zoom into it and see where it was taken. And throughout the book  there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. So you can open this one. MM  It starts playing immediately. And while it's playing  we can pinch and peak back at the page  and the movie keeps playing. Or we can zoom out to the table of contents  and the video keeps playing. But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. This one shows the wind potential all around the United States. But instead of just showing us the information  we can take our finger and explore  and see  state by state  exactly how much wind potential there is. We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. This is one of my favorites. So this shows ... When the wind is blowing  any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. And as the wind starts dying down  any excess energy will be diverted back into the house    the lights never go out. And this whole book  it doesn't just run on the iPad. It also runs on the iPhone. And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. And it works the exact same way. You can pinch into any page. Open it up. So that's Push Pop Press' first title  Al Gore's  Our Choice.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  That's spectacular. Do you want to be a publisher  a technology licenser  What is the business here  Is this something that other people can do  MM  Yeah  we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. So Melcher Media's team  who's on the East coast    and we're on the West coast  building the software    takes our tool and  every day  drags in images and text. CA  So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that   MM  Yes.  All right. Mike  thanks so much. MM  Thank you.  CA  Good luck.  My name is Arvind Gupta  and I'm a toymaker. I've been making toys for the last    years. The early '  s  I was in college. It was a very revolutionary time. It was a political ferment  so to say    students out in the streets of Paris  revolting against authority. America was jolted by the anti Vietnam movement  the Civil Rights movement. In India  we had the Naxalite movement  the  unclear  movement. But you know  when there is a political churning of society  it unleashes a lot of energy. The National Movement of India was testimony to that. Lots of people resigned from well paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement. Now in the early '  s  one of the great programs in India was to revitalize primary science in village schools. There was a person  Anil Sadgopal  did a Ph.D. from Caltech and returned back as a molecular biologist in India's cutting edge research institute  the TIFR. At     he was not able to relate the kind of  unclear  research  which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people. So he designed and went and started a village science program. Many people were inspired by this. The slogan of the early '  s was  Go to the people. Live with them  love them. Start from what they know. Build on what they have.  This was kind of the defining slogan. Well I took one year. I joined Telco  made TATA trucks  pretty close to Pune. I worked there for two years  and I realized that I was not born to make trucks. Often one doesn't know what one wants to do  but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do. So I took one year off  and I went to this village science program. And it was a turning point. It was a very small village    a weekly bazaar where people  just once in a week  they put in all the vats. So I said   I'm going to spend a year over here.  So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside. And one thing which I found was this black rubber. This is called a cycle valve tube. When you pump in air in a bicycle  you use a bit of this. And some of these models    so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube  you can put two matchsticks inside this  and you make a flexible joint. It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles    an acute angle  a right angle  an obtuse angle  a straight angle. It's like its own little coupling. If you have three of them  and you loop them together  well you make a triangle. With four  you make a square  you make a pentagon  you make a hexagon  you make all these kind of polygons. And they have some wonderful properties. If you look at the hexagon  for instance  it's like an amoeba  which is constantly changing its own profile. You can just pull this out  this becomes a rectangle. You give it a push  this becomes a parallelogram. But this is very shaky. Look at the pentagon  for instance  pull this out    it becomes a boat shape trapezium. Push it and it becomes house shaped. This becomes an isosceles triangle    again  very shaky. This square might look very square and prim. Give it a little push    this becomes a rhombus. It becomes kite shaped. But give a child a triangle  he can't do a thing to it. Why use triangles  Because triangles are the only rigid structures. We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come  it would start doing a jig. Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India  they might not have gone to engineering college  but no one makes a roof placed like this. Because if they put tiles on top  it's just going to crash. They always make a triangular roof. Now this is people science. And if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick  you'll get a T joint. And if I were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle  I would make a tetrahedron. So you make all these  D shapes. You make a tetrahedron like this. And once you make these  you make a little house. Put this on top. You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six. You just need a ton. Now this was    you make a joint of six  you make an icosahedron. You can play around with it. This makes an igloo. Now this is in     . I was a    year old young engineer. And I thought this was so much better than making trucks. If you  as a matter of fact  put four marbles inside  you simulate the molecular structure of methane  CH . Four atoms of hydrogen  the four points of the tetrahedron  which means the little carbon atom. Well since then  I just thought that I've been really privileged to go to over       schools in my country    village schools  government schools  municipal schools  Ivy League schools    I've been invited by most of them. And every time I go to a school  I see a gleam in the eyes of the children. I see hope. I see happiness in their faces. Children want to make things. Children want to do things. Now this  we make lots and lots of pumps. Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon. It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon. And we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it. So all you do is    it's a very kind of provocative statement    this old bicycle tube and this old plastic  unclear  This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube. And this is how you make a valve. You put a little sticky tape. This is one way traffic. Well we make lots and lots of pumps. And this is the other one    that you just take a straw  and you just put a stick inside and you make two half cuts. Now this is what you do  is you bend both these legs into a triangle  and you just wrap some tape around. And this is the pump. And now  if you have this pump  it's like a great  great sprinkler. It's like a centrifuge. If you spin something  it tends to fly out. Well in terms of    if you were in Andhra Pradesh  you would make this with the palmyra leaf. Many of our folk toys have great science principles. If you spin top something  it tends to fly out. If I do it with both hands  you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man. Right. This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing. There are four pictures. You see insects  you see frogs  snakes  eagles  butterflies  frogs  snakes  eagles. Here's a paper which you could  unclear     designed by a mathematician at Harvard in       Arthur Stone  documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books. But this is great fun for children. They all study about the food chain. The insects are eaten by the frogs  the frogs are eaten by the snakes  the snakes are eaten by the eagles. And this can be  if you had a whole photocopy paper    A  size paper    you could be in a municipal school  you could be in a government school    a paper  a scale and a pencil    no glue  no scissors. In three minutes  you just fold this up. And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination. If you take a smaller paper  you make a smaller flexagon. With a bigger one  you make a bigger one. Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here. And you put a little fan here. And this is a hundred year old toy. There have been six major research papers on this. There's some grooves over here  you can see. And if I take a reed    if I rub this  something very amazing happens. Six major research papers on this. As a matter of fact  Feynman  as a child  was very fascinated by this. He wrote a paper on this. And you don't need the three billion dollar Hadron Collider for doing this.  Laughter   Applause  This is there for every child  and every child can enjoy this. If you want to put a colored disk  well all these seven colors coalesce. And this is what Newton talked about     years back  that white light's made of seven colors  just by spinning this around. This is a straw. What we've done  we've just sealed both the ends with tape  nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner  so there's holes in the opposite corners  there's a little hole over here. This is a kind of a blowing straw. I just put this inside this. There's a hole here  and I shut this. And this costs very little money to make    great fun for children to do. What we do is make a very simple electric motor. Now this is the simplest motor on Earth. The most expensive thing is the battery inside this. If you have a battery  it costs five cents to make it. This is an old bicycle tube  which gives you a broad rubber band  two safety pins. This is a permanent magnet. Whenever current flows through the coil  this becomes an electromagnet. It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin. We made       . Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years  they just muck up the definition and they spit it out. When teachers make it  children make it. You can see a gleam in their eye. They get a thrill of what science is all about. And this science is not a rich man's game. In a democratic country  science must reach to our most oppressed  to the most marginalized children. This program started with    schools and spread to       government schools. Over         children learn science this way. And we're just trying to see possibilities. Look  this is the tetrapak    awful materials from the point of view of the environment. There are six layers    three layers of plastic  aluminum    which are are sealed together. They are fused together  so you can't separate them. Now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron. So something which is trash  which is choking all the seabirds  you could just recycle this into a very  very joyous    all the platonic solids can be made with things like this. This is a little straw  and what you do is you just nip two corners here  and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth. You put this in your mouth  and you blow. It's children's delight  a teacher's envy  as they say. You're not able to see how the sound is produced  because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth. I'm going to keep this outside  to blow out. I'm going to suck in air. So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations. The other is that you keep blowing at it  keep making the sound  and you keep cutting it. And something very  very nice happens. And when you get a very small one    This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this. Well before I go any further  this is something worth sharing. This is a touching slate meant for blind children. This is strips of Velcro  this is my drawing slate  and this is my drawing pen  which is basically a film box. It's basically like a fisherman's line  a fishing line. And this is wool over here. If I crank the handle  all the wool goes inside. And what a blind child can do is to just draw this. Wool sticks on Velcro. There are    million blind children in our country    who live in a world of darkness. And this has come as a great boon to them. There's a factory out there making our children blind  not able to provide them with food  not able to provide them with vitamin A. But this has come as a great boon for them. There are no patents. Anyone can make it. This is very  very simple. You can see  this is the generator. It's a crank generator. These are two magnets. This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs. Small pulley and two strong magnets. And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED. If I spin this pulley  the small one's going to spin much faster. There will be a spinning magnetic field. Lines  of course  would be cut  the force will be generated. And you can see  this LED is going to glow. So this is a small crank generator. Well  this is  again  it's just a ring  a steel ring with steel nuts. And what you can do is just  if you give it a twirl  well they just keep going on. And imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on. And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this. Well in the end  what we can also do  we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps. This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar. It's a great cricket cap.  Laughter   Applause  When first you see Nehru and Gandhi  this is the Nehru cap    just half a newspaper. We make lots of toys with newspapers  and this is one of them. And this is    you can see    this is a flapping bird. All of our old newspapers  we cut them into little squares. And if you have one of these birds    children in Japan have been making this bird for many  many years. And you can see  this is a little fantail bird. Well in the end  I'll just end with a story. This is called  The Captain's Hat Story.  The captain was a captain of a sea going ship. It goes very slowly. And there were lots of passengers on the ship  and they were getting bored  so the captain invited them on the deck.  Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance  and I'll provide you with good food and drinks.  And the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia. The first day  it was a huge umbrella cap  like a captain's cap. That night  when the passengers would be sleeping  he would give it one more fold  and the second day  he would be wearing a fireman's cap    with a little shoot just like a designer cap  because it protects the spinal cord. And the second night  he would take the same cap and give it another fold. And the third day  it would be a Shikari cap    just like an adventurer's cap. And the third night  he would give it two more folds    and this is a very  very famous cap. If you've seen any of our Bollywood films  this is what the policeman wears  it's called a zapalu cap. It's been catapulted to international glory. And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship. So that's a ship. And now the end  everyone was enjoying the journey very much. They were singing and dancing. Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves. And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves. A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down. And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down. And there's a third one over here. This swallows the bridge and knocks it down. And the ship sinks  and the captain has lost everything  but for a life jacket. Thank you so much. Mark Zuckerberg  a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed. And the journalist was asking him   Why is this so important   And Zuckerberg said   A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.  And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like. So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine  the Internet meant something very different to me. It meant a connection to the world. It meant something that would connect us all together. And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society. But there's this shift in how information is flowing online  and it's invisible. And if we don't pay attention to it  it could be a real problem. So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time    my Facebook page. I'm progressive  politically    big surprise    but I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives. I like hearing what they're thinking about  I like seeing what they link to  I like learning a thing or two. And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed. And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on  and it was noticing that  actually  I was clicking more on my liberal friends' links than on my conservative friends' links. And without consulting me about it  it had edited them out. They disappeared. So Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible  algorithmic editing of the Web. Google's doing it too. If I search for something  and you search for something  even right now at the very same time  we may get very different search results. Even if you're logged out  one engineer told me  there are    signals that Google looks at    everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located    that it uses to personally tailor your query results. Think about it for a second  there is no standard Google anymore. And you know  the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see. You can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's. But a couple of weeks ago  I asked a bunch of friends to Google  Egypt  and to send me screen shots of what they got. So here's my friend Scott's screen shot. And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot. When you put them side by side  you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are. But when you do read the links  it's really quite remarkable. Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results. Scott's results were full of them. And this was the big story of the day at that time. That's how different these results are becoming. So it's not just Google and Facebook either. This is something that's sweeping the Web. There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization. Yahoo News  the biggest news site on the Internet  is now personalized    different people get different things. Huffington Post  the Washington Post  the New York Times    all flirting with personalization in various ways. And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see  but not necessarily what we need to see. As Eric Schmidt said   It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them.  So I do think this is a problem. And I think  if you take all of these filters together  you take all these algorithms  you get what I call a filter bubble. And your filter bubble is your own personal  unique universe of information that you live in online. And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are  and it depends on what you do. But the thing is that you don't decide what gets in. And more importantly  you don't actually see what gets edited out. So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix. And they were looking at the Netflix queues  and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed  which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses. They enter the queue  they just zip right out. So  Iron Man  zips right out  and  Waiting for Superman  can wait for a really long time. What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves. You know we all want to be someone who has watched  Rashomon   but right now we want to watch  Ace Ventura  for the fourth time. So the best editing gives us a bit of both. It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan. It gives us some information vegetables  it gives us some information dessert. And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters  these personalized filters  is that  because they're mainly looking at what you click on first  it can throw off that balance. And instead of a balanced information diet  you can end up surrounded by information junk food. What this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong. In a broadcast society    this is how the founding mythology goes    in a broadcast society  there were these gatekeepers  the editors  and they controlled the flows of information. And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way  and it allowed all of us to connect together  and it was awesome. But that's not actually what's happening right now. What we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones. And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did. So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us  if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see  then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance. We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important    this is what TED does    other points of view. And the thing is  we've actually been here before as a society. In       it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities. Then people noticed that they were doing something really important. That  in fact  you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information  that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter  and then journalistic ethics developed. It wasn't perfect  but it got us through the last century. And so now  we're kind of back in      on the Web. And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing. I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google    Larry and Sergey    people who have helped build the Web as it is  and I'm grateful for that. But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life  a sense of civic responsibility. We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters. And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't. Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being. We need it to connect us all together. We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives. And it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one. Thank you. Phyllis Rodriguez  We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship. And it is. And yet  it feels natural to us now. I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September   th      . We didn't know if he had perished yet until    hours later. At the time  we knew that it was political. We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son    my husband  Orlando  and I and our family. And when I saw it    and yet  through the shock  the terrible shock  and the terrible explosion in our lives  literally  we were not vengeful. And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism  and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him  if convicted  my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that  publicly. Through that and through human rights groups  we were brought together with several other victims' families. When I saw Aicha in the media  coming over when her son was indicted  and I thought   What a brave woman. Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger.  I was still in deep grief  I knew I didn't have the strength. I knew I would find her someday  or we would find each other. Because  when people heard that my son was a victim  I got immediate sympathy. But when people learned what her son was accused of  she didn't get that sympathy. But her suffering is equal to mine. So we met in November       and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui. And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. So they introduced me to five families. And I saw Phyllis  and I watched her. She was the only mother in the group. The others were brothers  sisters. And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother  just like me. I suffered a lot as a mother. I was married when I was   . I lost a child when I was     a second child when I was   . So the story with Zacarias was too much really. And I still suffer  because my son is like he's buried alive. I know she really cried for her son. But she knows where he is. My son  I don't know where he is. I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured. I don't know what happened to him. So that's why I decided to tell my story  so that my suffering is something positive for other women. For all the women  all the mothers that give life  you can give back  you can change. It's up to us women  because we are women  because we love our children. We must be hand in hand and do something together. It's not against women  it's for us  for us women  for our children. I talk against violence  against terrorism. I go to schools to talk to young  Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young. So if I can save one of the young girls  and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did  well this is something good. This is why I'm here in front of you. PR  I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha  starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members    which was a very private meeting with security  because it was November       and  frankly  we were afraid of the super patriotism of that time in the country    those of us family members. But we were all so nervous.  Why does she want to meet us   And then she was nervous.  Why did we want to meet her   What did we want from each other  Before we knew each others' names  or anything  we had embraced and wept. Then we sat in a circle with support  with help  from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. And Aicha started  and she said   I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent  but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families. I know what it is to suffer  and I feel that if there is a crime  a person should be tried fairly and punished.  But she reached out to us in that way  and it was  I'd like to say  it was an ice breaker. And what happened then is we all told our stories  and we all connected as human beings. By the end of the afternoon    it was about three hours after lunch    we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. Now what I learned from her  is a woman  not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then  and what was being done to her son  but the life she's had. I never had met someone with such a hard life  from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. And I feel that we have a special connection  which I value very much. And I think it's all about being afraid of the other  but making that step and then realizing   Hey  this wasn't so hard. Who else can I meet that I don't know  or that I'm so different from   So  Aicha  do you have a couple of words for conclusion  Because our time is up. that we have to try to know other people  the other. You have to be generous  and your hearts must be generous  your mind must be generous. You must be tolerant. You have to fight against violence. And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other. This is what I wanted to say. Good afternoon  everybody. I've got something to show you. Think about this as a pixel  a flying pixel. This is what we call  in our lab  sensible design. Let me tell you a bit about it. Now if you take this picture    I'm Italian originally  and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom    but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula   racing over the past couple of decades. Now some time ago  if you wanted to win a Formula   race  you take a budget  and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car. And if the car and the driver were good enough  then you'd win the race. Now today  if you want to win the race  actually you need also something like this    something that monitors the car in real time  has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car  transmitting this information into the system  and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected. This is what  in engineering terms  you would call a real time control system. And basically  it's a system made of two components    a sensing and an actuating component. What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives. Our cities  over the past few years  just have been blanketed with networks  electronics. They're becoming like computers in open air. And  as computers in open air  they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated. If we fix cities  actually it's a big deal. Just as an aside  I wanted to mention  cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust  but they are    percent of the world's population. They are    percent of the energy consumption    up to    percent of CO  emissions. So if we're able to do something with cities  that's a big deal. Beyond cities  all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects. That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year  during the summer. It's called  Talk to Me.  Well our objects  our environment is starting to talk back to us. In a certain sense  it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator. And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there. In a certain sense  it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ... you know  when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses  at the end it said that he took the hammer  threw it at the Moses    actually you can still see a small chip underneath    and said  shouted   Perch  non parli  Why don't you talk   Well today  for the first time  our environment is starting to talk back to us. And I'll show just a few examples    again  with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it. Let's starting with sensing. Well  the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab. It was four and a half years ago in Italy. And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world    that's a cellphone network    and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network  that's collected anyway by the operator  in order to understand how the city works. The summer was a lucky summer        . It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup. Some of you might remember  it was Italy and France playing  and then Zidane at the end  the headbutt. And anyway  Italy won at the end. Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network. Here you see the city. You see the Colosseum in the middle  the river Tiber. It's morning  before the match. You see the timeline on the top. Early afternoon  people here and there  making calls and moving. The match begins    silence. France scores. Italy scores. Halftime  people make a quick call and go to the bathroom. Second half. End of normal time. First overtime  second. Zidane  the headbutt in a moment. Italy wins. Yeah. Well  that night  everybody went to celebrate in the center. You saw the big peak. The following day  again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time. And then everybody moved down. You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo  where  since Roman times  people go to celebrate  to have a big party  and you see the peak at the end of the day. Well  that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago. Another quick example about sensing  it's not about people  but about things we use and consume. Well today  we know everything about where our objects come from. This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer  how they came together. But we know very little about where things go. So in this project  we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system. So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle  just over a year ago  to tag what they were throwing away    different types of things  as you can see here    things they would throw away anyway. Then we put a little chip  little tag  onto the trash and then started following it. Here are the results we just obtained. From Seattle ... after one week. With this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system. We can actually do the same thing with much less energy. This data was not available before. But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening. But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away  it doesn't disappear  it's still somewhere on the planet. And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there. And if we show that to people  then we can also promote some behavioral change. So that was the reason for the project. My colleague at MIT  Assaf Biderman  he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing  but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning  and that's actuating our environment. And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza  Spain. It started with a question by the mayor of the city  who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space  in architecture. And the question was  How could technology  new technology  be added to that  And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was  imagine this pipe  and you've got valves  solenoid valves  taps  opening and closing. You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water. If those pixels fall  you can write on it  you can show patterns  images  text. And even you can approach it  and it will open up to let you jump through  as you see in this image. Well  we presented this to Mayor Belloch. He liked it very much. And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo. We called it Digital Water Pavilion. The whole building is made of water. There's no doors or windows  but when you approach it  it will open up to let you in. The roof also is covered with water. And if there's a bit of wind  if you want to minimize splashing  you can actually lower the roof. Or you could close the building  and the whole architecture will disappear  like in this case. You know  these days  you always get images during the winter  when they take the roof down  of people who have been there and said   They demolished the building.  No  they didn't demolish it  just when it goes down  the architecture almost disappears. Here's the building working. You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside. And here was myself trying not to get wet  testing the sensors that open the water. Well  I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working. But actually that night  it was even more fun. All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building  because the way of engaging with the building became something different. Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in  but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water  and you had to jump without getting wet. And that was  for us  was very interesting  because  as architects  as engineers  as designers  we always think about how people will use the things we design. But then reality's always unpredictable. And that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people. Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels  the pixels made of water  and then projections on them. And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now. That's  imagine those pixels could actually start flying. Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air  and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights    almost as a cloud that can move in space. Here is the video. So imagine one helicopter  like the one we saw before  moving with others  in synchrony. So you can have this cloud. You can have a kind of flexible screen or display  like this    a regular configuration in two dimensions. Or in regular  but in three dimensions  where the thing that changes is the light  not the pixels' position. You can play with a different type. Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes  different types of resolution. But then the whole thing can be just a  D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many  many directions. Here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before. When you turn on the light  actually you see this. So the same as we saw before. And imagine each of them then controlled by people. You can have each pixel having an input that comes from people  from people's movement  or so and so. I want to show you something here for the first time. We've been working with Roberto Bolle  one of today's top ballet dancers    the  toile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan    and actually captured his movement in  D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire. And here you can see Roberto dancing. You see on the left the pixels  the different resolutions being captured. It's both  D scanning in real time and motion capture. So you can reconstruct a whole movement. You can go all the way through. But then  once we have the pixels  then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation. So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for Flyfire. I wanted to show you the last project we are working on. It's something we're working on for the London Olympics. It's called The Cloud. And the idea here is  imagine  again  we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment    almost to impart what we call cloud raising    like barn raising  but with a cloud. Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel. And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that  over the past couple of decades  we went from the physical world to the digital one. This has been digitizing everything  knowledge  and making that accessible through the Internet. Now today  for the first time    and the Obama campaign showed us this    we can go from the digital world  from the self organizing power of networks  to the physical one. This can be  in our case  we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol. That means something built in a city. But tomorrow it can be  in order to tackle today's pressing challenges    think about climate change or CO  emissions    how we can go from the digital world to the physical one. So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together  collectively. The cloud is a cloud  again  made of pixels  in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles. And those particles are water  where our cloud is a cloud of pixels. It's a physical structure in London  but covered with pixels. You can move inside  have different types of experiences. You can actually see from underneath  sharing the main moments for the Olympics in      and beyond  and really using it as a way to connect with the community. So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top  of   like London's new mountaintop. You can enter inside it. And a kind of new digital beacon for the night    but most importantly  a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top. Thank you. So as a fashion designer  I've always tended to think of materials something like this  or this  or maybe this. But then I met a biologist  and now I think of materials like this    green tea  sugar  a few microbes and a little time. I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe  which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria  yeasts and other micro organisms  which spin cellulose in a fermentation process. Over time  these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface. So we start by brewing the tea. I brew up to about    liters of tea at a time  and then while it's still hot  add a couple of kilos of sugar. We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath. We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below    degrees C. And then we're ready to add the living organism. And along with that  some acetic acid. And once you get this process going  you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid. We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth. And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it. And actually  in hot weather  I can just grow it outside. So this is my mini fabric farm. After about three days  the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid. So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing. And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid. So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose. And they're sticking together  forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface. After about two to three weeks  we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness. So the bath on the left is after five days  and on the right  after   . And this is a static culture. You don't have to do anything to it  you just literally watch it grow. It doesn't need light. And when it's ready to harvest  you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold  soapy water. At this point  it's really heavy. It's over    percent water  so we need to let that evaporate. So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet. Again  you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air. And as it's drying  it's compressing  so what you're left with  depending on the recipe  is something that's either like a really light weight  transparent paper  or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather. And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally  or you can use the wet material to form it around a three dimensional shape. And as it evaporates  it will knit itself together  forming seams. So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea. I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin  which intrigues me. Since it's organic  I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals. I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation. Using fruit and vegetable staining  create organic patterning. And using indigo  make it anti microbial. And in fact  cotton would take up to    dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark. And because of the super absorbency of this kind of cellulose  it just takes one  and a really short one at that. What I can't yet do is make it water resistant. So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today  I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water. The dress would get really heavy  and eventually the seams would probably fall apart    leaving me feeling rather naked. Possibly a good performance piece  but definitely not ideal for everyday wear. What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need. So what I want to do is say to a future bug   Spin me a thread. Align it in this direction. Make it hydrophobic. And while you're at it  just form it around this  D shape.  Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing  and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels  possibly even replacement bone tissue. But with synthetic biology  we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality  quantity and shape of material that we desire. Obviously  as a designer  that's really exciting because then I start to think  wow  we could actually imagine growing consumable products. What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency. So we only grow what we need. There's no waste. And in fact  we could make it from a waste stream    so for example  a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant. Finally  at the end of use  we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings. What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton  leather or other textile materials. But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources. Ultimately  maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact. We could  for example  imagine growing a lamp  a chair  a car or maybe even a house. So I guess what my question to you is  in the future  what would you choose to grow  Thank you very much. Bruno Giussani  Suzanne  just a curiosity  what you're wearing is not random.  Suzanne Lee  No.  This is one of the jackets you grew  SL  Yes  it is. It's probably    part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes. It's absorbing my sweat  and it's feeding on it. BG  Okay  so we'll let you go and save it  and rescue it. Suzanne Lee.  SL  Thank you.  The universe is really big. We live in a galaxy  the Milky Way Galaxy. There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky  and you just keep the shutter open  as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope  it will see something like this. Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way    a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs. There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe.     billion is the only number you need to know. The age of the universe  between now and the Big Bang  is a hundred billion in dog years. Which tells you something about our place in the universe. One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it. It's extremely beautiful. I've often wondered  what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn't have any. But we would also like to understand it. As a cosmologist  I want to ask  why is the universe like this  One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time. If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity  it would be moving away from you. And if you look at a galaxy even farther away  it would be moving away faster. So we say the universe is expanding. What that means  of course  is that  in the past  things were closer together. In the past  the universe was more dense  and it was also hotter. If you squeeze things together  the temperature goes up. That kind of makes sense to us. The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much is that the universe  at early times  near the Big Bang  was also very  very smooth. You might think that that's not a surprise. The air in this room is very smooth. You might say   Well  maybe things just smoothed themselves out.  But the conditions near the Big Bang are very  very different than the conditions of the air in this room. In particular  things were a lot denser. The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the Big Bang. What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies  a hundred billion stars each. At early times  those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big    literally    at early times. And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections  without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else. Because if there had been  they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole. Keeping the universe very  very smooth at early times is not easy  it's a delicate arrangement. It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly. There is something that made it that way. We would like to know what. So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann  an Austrian physicist in the   th century. And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy. You've heard of entropy. It's the randomness  the disorder  the chaoticness of some systems. Boltzmann gave us a formula    engraved on his tombstone now    that really quantifies what entropy is. And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice  so that macroscopically it looks the same. If you have the air in this room  you don't notice each individual atom. A low entropy configuration is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way. A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way. This is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics    the law that says that entropy increases in the universe  or in some isolated bit of the universe. The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy. That's a wonderful insight  but it leaves something out. This insight that entropy increases  by the way  is what's behind what we call the arrow of time  the difference between the past and the future. Every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing    the fact that you can remember the past  but not the future. The fact that you are born  and then you live  and then you die  always in that order  that's because entropy is increasing. Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy  it's very natural for it to increase because there's more ways to be high entropy. What he didn't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place. The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very  very smooth. We'd like to understand that. That's our job as cosmologists. Unfortunately  it's actually not a problem that we've been giving enough attention to. It's not one of the first things people would say  if you asked a modern cosmologist   What are the problems we're trying to address   One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman.    years ago  he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures. He gave the popular lectures that became  The Character of Physical Law.  He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads that became  The Feynman Lectures on Physics.  He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became  The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation.  In every one of these books  every one of these sets of lectures  he emphasized this puzzle  Why did the early universe have such a small entropy  So he says    I'm not going to do the accent    he says   For some reason  the universe  at one time  had a very low entropy for its energy content  and since then the entropy has increased. The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding.  So that's our job. We want to know    this is    years ago   Surely   you're thinking   we've figured it out by now.  It's not true that we've figured it out by now. The reason the problem has gotten worse  rather than better  is because in      we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before. We learned that it's accelerating. The universe is not only expanding. If you look at the galaxy  it's moving away. If you come back a billion years later and look at it again  it will be moving away faster. Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating. Unlike the low entropy of the early universe  even though we don't know the answer for this  we at least have a good theory that can explain it  if that theory is right  and that's the theory of dark energy. It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy. In every little cubic centimeter of space  whether or not there's stuff  whether or not there's particles  matter  radiation or whatever  there's still energy  even in the space itself. And this energy  according to Einstein  exerts a push on the universe. It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other. Because dark energy  unlike matter or radiation  does not dilute away as the universe expands. The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same  even as the universe gets bigger and bigger. This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future. For one thing  the universe will expand forever. Back when I was your age  we didn't know what the universe was going to do. Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future. Einstein was fond of this idea. But if there's dark energy  and the dark energy does not go away  the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.    billion years in the past      billion dog years  but an infinite number of years into the future. Meanwhile  for all intents and purposes  space looks finite to us. Space may be finite or infinite  but because the universe is accelerating  there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see. There's a finite region of space that we have access to  surrounded by a horizon. So even though time goes on forever  space is limited to us. Finally  empty space has a temperature. In the     s  Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole  even though you think it's black  it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics. The curvature of space time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation  and the black hole radiates. A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space  then the whole universe radiates. The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations. And so even though the universe will last forever  and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away  there will always be some radiation  some thermal fluctuations  even in empty space. So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever. Well what is the implication of that  That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the   th century. He said  well  entropy increases because there are many  many more ways for the universe to be high entropy  rather than low entropy. But that's a probabilistic statement. It will probably increase  and the probability is enormously huge. It's not something you have to worry about    the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us. It's very  very unlikely. Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever  that would happen. Everything that is allowed  every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room  would eventually be obtained. So Boltzmann says  look  you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium. He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe. He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton    they were absolute  they just stuck there forever. So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere    the everything molecules. But if you're Boltzmann  you know that if you wait long enough  the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations. And then  of course  in the natural course of things  they will expand back. So it's not that entropy must always increase    you can get fluctuations into lower entropy  more organized situations. Well if that's true  Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern sounding ideas    the multiverse and the anthropic principle. He says  the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can't live there. Remember  life itself depends on the arrow of time. We would not be able to process information  metabolize  walk and talk  if we lived in thermal equilibrium. So if you imagine a very  very big universe  an infinitely big universe  with randomly bumping into each other particles  there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states  and then they relax back. But there will also be large fluctuations. Occasionally  you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies. So Boltzmann says  we will only live in the part of the multiverse  in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles  where life is possible. That's the region where entropy is low. Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. Now your homework assignment is to really think about this  to contemplate what it means. Carl Sagan once famously said that  in order to make an apple pie  you must first invent the universe.  But he was not right. In Boltzmann's scenario  if you want to make an apple pie  you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie. That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven  and then making you an apple pie. So this scenario makes predictions. And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal. Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are  and we have  not only our memories  but our impression that outside there's something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy  it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech  the United States and the galaxy. The good news is that  therefore  this scenario does not work  it is not right. This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation. Even if you left our galaxy out  you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies. And Feynman also understood this. Feynman says   From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation  all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before  we will find it mixed up  and not like the piece we've just looked at    high entropy. If our order were due to a fluctuation  we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it. We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation.  So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer  If the universe is not a fluctuation  why did the early universe have a low entropy  And I would love to tell you the answer  but I'm running out of time. Here is the universe that we tell you about  versus the universe that really exists. I just showed you this picture. The universe is expanding for the last    billion years or so. It's cooling off. But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more. If the dark energy remains around  the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel  they will stop burning. They will fall into black holes. We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes. That universe will last    to the     years    a lot longer than our little universe has lived. The future is much longer than the past. But even black holes don't last forever. They will evaporate  and we will be left with nothing but empty space. That empty space lasts essentially forever. However  you notice  since empty space gives off radiation  there's actually thermal fluctuations  and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space. So even though the universe lasts forever  there's only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe. They all happen over a period of time equal to    to the    to the     years. So here's two questions for you. Number one  If the universe lasts for    to the    to the     years  why are we born in the first    billion years of it  in the warm  comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang  Why aren't we in empty space  You might say   Well there's nothing there to be living   but that's not right. You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness. Why aren't you  More homework assignment for you. So like I said  I don't actually know the answer. I'm going to give you my favorite scenario. Either it's just like that. There is no explanation. This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions. Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. An egg  an unbroken egg  is a low entropy configuration  and yet  when we open our refrigerator  we do not go   Hah  how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator.  That's because an egg is not a closed system  it comes out of a chicken. Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. Maybe there is something that naturally  through the growth of the laws of physics  gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations. If that's true  it would happen more than once  we would be part of a much bigger multiverse. That's my favorite scenario. So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation. My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history. And    years from now  all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities. We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse. And even better  we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations. This is a prediction. I might be wrong. But we've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like  why it came to be in the way it did for many  many years. It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday. Thank you. It's great being here at TED. You know  I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head  but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. The little things in life  sometimes that we forget about  like pollination  that we take for granted. And you can't tell the story about pollinators    bees  bats  hummingbirds  butterflies    without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co evolved over    million years. I've been filming time lapse flowers    hours a day  seven days a week  for over    years. To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of. It fills me with wonder  and it opens my heart. Beauty and seduction  I believe  is nature's tool for survival  because we will protect what we fall in love with. Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. It reminds us that we are a part of nature  and we're not separate from it. When I heard about the vanishing bees  Colony Collapse Disorder  it motivated me to take action. We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat. And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind. It's like the canary in the coalmine. If they disappear  so do we. It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers   What motivates the pollinators   Well  their answer was   It's all about risk and reward.  Like a wide eyed kid  I'd say   Why is that   And they'd say   Well  because they want to survive.  I go   Why    Well  in order to reproduce.   Well  why   And I thought that they'd probably say   Well  it's all about sex.  And Chip Taylor  our monarch butterfly expert  he replied   Nothing lasts forever. Everything in the universe wears out.  And that blew my mind. Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward  as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life. Rarely seen by the naked eye  this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment. It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself  over and over again. So here is some nectar from my film. I hope you'll drink  tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden. And always take time to smell the flowers  and let it fill you with beauty  and rediscover that sense of wonder. Here are some images from the film. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. My journey to become a polar specialist  photographing  specializing in the polar regions  began when I was four years old  when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island  up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of     Inuit people  where  we  were one of three non Inuit families. And in this community  we didn't have a television  we didn't have computers  obviously  radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit  playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox  and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you  for just two minutes only  some images  a cross section of my work  to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile   Have You Ever.  I don't know why National Geographic has done this  they've never done this before  but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this  so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are    you'll see them at the start of the slide show    there's only about four images    but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white  but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear  or a Kermode bear. There are only     of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought  my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking  So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life  after I was a photographer  because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine  they remind us all the time  they publish pictures  not excuses. And after two months of sitting there    one day  thinking that it was all over  this incredible big white male came down  right beside me  three feet away from me  and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old growth forest and sat up beside this     year old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him  just in the forest  and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy. Brandi Carlile    Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods      And everything there feels just as it should     You're part of the life there     You're part of something good     If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods     Have you ever stared into a starry sky      Lying on your back  you're asking why     What's the purpose      I wonder  who am I      If you've ever stared into a starry sky     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     Aah  ah  aah     Ah  oh  oh  ah  ah  oh  oh     Have you ever stared into a starry sky      Have you ever been out walking in the snow      Tried to get back where you were before     You always end up     Not knowing where to go     If you've ever been out walking in the snow     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     Aah  ah  aah  ah  aah     Ah  ah  oh  ah  ah  oh  ah     Oh  ah  ah  ah     Ah  ah  oh  ah  ah  oh  oh     If you'd ever been out walking you would know   Paul Nicklen  Thank you very much. The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK  let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact  scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years  then they said    years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic  the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to    years. And what does that mean  After a while of reading this in the news  it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that  if we lose ice  we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears  they could become extinct in the next    to     years. And there's no better  sexier  more beautiful  charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal        lb. bearded seal    grabbed it  swam back and ate it. And he was so full  he was so happy and so fat eating this seal  that  as I approached him    about    feet away    to get this picture  his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate  he was so full    he probably had about     lbs of meat in his belly    and as he ate inside one side of his mouth  he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive  but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist    years ago  we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years  we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea  floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere  and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice  which is great for them  they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately     percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals  these are the  fatsicles  of the Arctic. These little  fat dumplings      pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice  and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi year ice that's    years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that  as this ice melts  these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's     ft.  we're on our safety lines  the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice  that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice  you have     species of microorganisms. And in the spring  when the sun returns to the ice  it forms the phytoplankton  grows under that ice  and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed  and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips  my face is frozen  I can't feel my hands  I can't feel my feet. And I've come up  and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions  it's so extreme that  when I go down  almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant  and I'm looking up at him  and I'm going   Woo. Woo. Woo.  Which means   Take my camera.  And he thinks I'm saying   Take my picture.  So we had this little communication breakdown. But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales  bowhead whales  and narwhals  and polar bears  and leopard seals today  but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole  just through that hole that you just saw  and I looked up under the underside of the ice  and I was dizzy  I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous    no rope  no safety line  the whole world is moving around me    and I thought   I'm in trouble.  But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice  giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic  right here. And when you have low  productivity in this  in ice  the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly  science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over     years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived     years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals  these majestic narwhals with their eight foot long ivory tusks  don't have to be here  they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe  catch a breath  because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright  my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed  I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful  I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals  since the time of Shackleton  have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in         a scientist was taken down and drowned  and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like   We knew they were vicious. We knew they were.  And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea  I want to go to Antarctica  get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake    find out if they really are these vicious animals  or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh  and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. As a species  as humans  we like to say penguins are really cute  therefore  leopard seals eat them  so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute  and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are    ft. long  a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get    tourists packed into a Zodiac  floating in these icy waters  and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink  they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing    it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean    it doesn't have hands    it's going to take a little bite  the boat pops  and off they go. So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage    isn't that beautiful    after five days of crossing the Drake Passage  we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden    Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat  and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice  he goes   That's a bloody big seal  ya.  And this seal is taking this penguin by the head  and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside out  so it can eat the meat off the bones  and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin  came under the boat  the Zodiac  starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down  and that's when Goran said to me   This is a good seal  ya. It's time for you to get in the water.  And I looked at Goran  and I said to him   Forget that.  But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter  F.  But he was right. He scolded me out  and said   This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses.  So I had such dry mouth    probably not as bad as now    but I had such  such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth  and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me  engulfed my whole camera    and her teeth are up here and down here    but Goran  before I had gotten in the water  had given me amazing advice. He said   If you get scared  you close your eyes  ya  and she'll go away.  So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes  and then the most amazing thing happened    she totally relaxed. She went off  she got a penguin. She stopped about    feet away from me  and she sat there with this penguin  the penguin's flapping  and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me  takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me  And after she did this four or five times  she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic  but I swear that she looked at me like   This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean.  So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins  she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me  bobbing like this  and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding  because I was crying underwater  just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this.  Laughter  And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones  so she brought me dead penguins. Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head  and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like   Are you for real   Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world  you're either breeding or you're eating    and I'm not breeding  so ... And then that wasn't enough  she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force feed my camera  which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated  she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would  I think  let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far  I got nervous because she came up to me  she rolled over on her back  and she did this deep  guttural jackhammer sound  this gok gok gok gok. And I thought  she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me  and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away  went and got its penguin and brought it to me. That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with    other leopard seals  and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with  and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears  these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart  and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic  I'll take you  let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm thrilled to be here. I'm going to talk about a new  old material that still continues to amaze us  and that might impact the way we think about material science  high technology    and maybe  along the way  also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation. So that's kind of a bold statement. I'll tell you a little bit more. This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true. It's sustainable  it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature    and is biodegradable with a clock  so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years. It's edible  it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response. It actually gets reintegrated in the body. And it's technological  so it can do things like microelectronics  and maybe photonics do. And the material looks something like this. In fact  this material you see is clear and transparent. The components of this material are just water and protein. So this material is silk. So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk. So the question is  how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia  The process of discovery  generally  is inspired by nature. And so we marvel at silk worms    the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber. The silk worm does a remarkable thing  it uses these two ingredients  protein and water  that are in its gland  to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection    so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar. And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about  and that we're familiar with  for the textile industry  the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things. We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar  to this natural Kevlar. So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material. And this is an insight that came  about two decades ago  from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with  David Kaplan. And so we get this starting material. And so this starting material is back to the basic building block. And then we use this to do a variety of things    like  for example  this film. And we take advantage of something that is very simple. The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do. They find their way to self assemble. So the recipe is simple  you take the silk solution  you pour it  and you wait for the protein to self assemble. And then you detach the protein and you get this film  as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates. But I mentioned that the film is also technological. And so what does that mean  It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology  like microelectronics and nanoscale technology. And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface  which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale. So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD. And we can store information that's film with water and protein. So we tried something out  and we wrote a message in a piece of silk  which is right here  and the message is over there. And much like in the DVD  you can read it out optically. And this requires a stable hand  so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people. So let me see. So as you see the film go in transparently through there  and then ... And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that. So once you have these attributes of this material  then you can do a lot of things. It's actually not limited to films. And so the material can assume a lot of formats. And then you go a little crazy  and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays  like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes. Or you can do beautiful things that  if the camera can capture  you can make. You can add a third dimensionality to the film. And if the angle is right  you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk. But you can do other things. You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light  and so we've made optical fibers. But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics. And you can think of different formats. So for instance  if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle  we do microneedle arrays. What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that's made of silk    just to give you a sense of size. You can do bigger things. You can do gears and nuts and bolts    that you can buy at Whole Foods. And the gears work in water as well. So you think of alternative mechanical parts. And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins  for example  or maybe an entire bone. And so you have here a little example of a small skull    what we call mini Yorick. But you can do things like cups  for example  and so  if you add a little bit of gold  if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods. You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap. Or if you're fashion forward  some silk LED tattoos. So there's versatility  as you see  in the material formats  that you can do with silk. But there are still some unique traits. I mean  why would you want to do all these things for real  I mentioned it briefly at the beginning  the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible. And you see here a picture of a tissue section. And so what does that mean  that it's biodegradable and biocompatible  You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted. Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats  in principle  can be implanted and disappear. And what you see there in that tissue section  in fact  is you see that reflector tape. So  much like you're seen at night by a car  then the idea is that you can see  if you illuminate tissue  you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk. And you see there  it gets reintegrated in tissue. And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing  but reintegration in the environment is important. So you have a clock  you have protein  and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt    unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday. It's edible  so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food. It doesn't taste good  so I'm going to need some help with that. But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle. Silk  during its self assembly process  acts like a cocoon for biological matter. And so if you change the recipe  and you add things when you pour    so you add things to your liquid silk solution    where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines  the self assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants. So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive. So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together    a fractured bone together    and deliver drugs at the same  while your bone is healing  for example. Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge. So we've made a silk card with penicillin in it. And we stored penicillin at    degrees C  so     degrees Fahrenheit  for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin. And so that could be     that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels.  Laughter  And of course  there's no use in storage if you can't use  it . And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have  that they're programmably degradable. And so what you see there is the difference. In the top  you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade  and in the bottom  a film that has been programmed to degrade in water. And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it. So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before. And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you've seen. So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread. We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do  whether you want to replace a vein or a bone  or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics  perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt  maybe carry your drugs in your pocket  deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert  the answer may be in a thread of silk. Thank you. When I was a child  I always wanted to be a superhero. I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy. But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true. So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton  which was a lot of fun  but didn't yield much result. When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers  I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science  to find a more useful truth. I started my journey in California  with a UC Berkeley    year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook  and tried to measure their success and well being throughout their life. By measuring the students' smiles  researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long lasting a subject's marriage would be  how well she would score on standardized tests of well being  and how inspiring she would be to others. In another yearbook  I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture. When I first saw his picture  I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar. But now I know it was all in his smile. Another aha  moment came from a      Wayne State University research project that looked into pre     s baseball cards of Major League players. The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life. Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only   .  years  where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost    years. The good news is that we're actually born smiling. Using  D ultrasound technology  we can now see that developing babies appear to smile  even in the womb. When they're born  babies continue to smile    initially  mostly in their sleep. And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice. Smiling is one of the most basic  biologically uniform expressions of all humans. In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea  Paul Ekman  the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions  found that even members of the Fore tribe  who were completely disconnected from Western culture  and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals  attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would. So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing  we smile often  and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction. How many people here in this room smile more than    times per day  Raise your hand if you do. Oh  wow. Outside of this room  more than a third of us smile more than    times per day  whereas less than    percent of us smile less than five. In fact  those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children  who smile as many as     times per day. Have you ever wondered why being around children  who smile so frequently  makes you smile very often  A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles. You ask why  Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious  and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles. Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real  so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler. In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont Ferrand in France  subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles. Without the pencil  subjects were excellent judges  but with the pencil in their mouth    when they could not mimic the smile they saw    their judgment was impaired. In addition to theorizing on evolution in  The Origin of Species   Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory. His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better  rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good. In his study  Darwin actually cited a French neurologist  Guillaume Duchenne  who sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles. Please  don't try this at home. In a related German study  researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles. The finding supported Darwin's theory  by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain  in a way that helps us feel better when we smile. Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate    a well regarded pleasure inducer    cannot match. British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to       bars of chocolate. Wait    The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to        pounds sterling in cash. That's like    grand a smile. It's not bad. And think about it this way         times        quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day. And unlike lots of chocolate  lots of smiling can actually make you healthier. Smiling can help reduce the level of stress enhancing hormones like cortisol  adrenaline and dopamine  increase the level of mood enhancing hormones like endorphins  and reduce overall blood pressure. And if that's not enough  smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others. A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile  you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous  but you actually appear to be more competent. So whenever you want to look great and competent  reduce your stress or improve your marriage  or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost  or as if you found    grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages  or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer  healthier  happier life  smile. My name is Amit. And    months ago  I had another job at Google  and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here  and she allowed me to do it. And it took    months. A lot of fun  negotiations and stories  I can tell you  with    very interesting museums from nine countries. But I'm going to focus on the demo. There are a lot of stories about why we did this. I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide  and it's access. And I grew up in India. I had a great education    I'm not complaining    but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks. And so when I started traveling and going to these museums  I started learning a lot. And while working at Google  I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together. So we formed a team  a great team of people  and we started doing this. I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch. So  simple  you come to GoogleArtProject.com. You look around at all these museums here. You've got the Uffizi  you've got the MoMA  the Hermitage  the Rijks  the Van Gogh. I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites  the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Two ways of going in    very simple. Click and  bang  you're in this museum. It doesn't matter where you are    Bombay  Mexico  it doesn't really matter. You move around  you have fun. You want to navigate around the museum  Open the plan up  and  in one click  jump. You're in there  you want to go to the end of the corridor. Keep going. Have fun. Explore. Thanks. I haven't come to the best part. So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings   The Harvesters  by Pieter Bruegel at the Met. I see this plus sign. If the museum has given us the image  you click on it. Now this is one of the images. So this is all of the meta data information. For those of you who are truly interested in art  you can click this    but I'm going to click this off right now. And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology. So this image  for example  has close to  I think  around    billion pixels. And I get a lot of people asking me   What do you get for    billion pixels   So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for    billion pixels. You can zoom around very simply. You see some fun stuff happening here. I love this guy  his expression is priceless. But then you really want to go deep. And so I started playing around  and I found something going on over here. And I was like   Hold on. That sounds interesting.  Went in  and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something. I did a little research  spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met  and actually found out that this is a game called squall  which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday. And apparently it was quite popular. I don't know why they did it  but I learned something about it. Now just to get really deep in  you can really get to the cracks. Now just to give you some perspective  I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get. Here is where we were  and this is the painting. The best is yet to come    so in a second. So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA  again in New York. So another one of my favorites   The Starry Night.  Now the example I showed you was all about finding details. But what if you want to see brush strokes  And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece  You zoom in. You really go in. I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting  and I'm really going to get to the cracks. This is  The Starry Night   I think  never seen like this before. I'm going to show you my other favorite feature. There's a lot of other stuff here  but I don't have time. This is the real cool part. It's called Collections. Any one of you  anybody    doesn't matter if you're rich  if you're poor  if you have a fancy house    doesn't matter. You can go and create your own museum online    create your own collection across all these images. Very simply  you go in    and I've created this  called The Power of Zoom    you can just zoom around. This is  The Ambassadors   based in the National Gallery. You can annotate the stuff  send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. So I think  in conclusion  for me  the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google. It doesn't  in my opinion  even come from the museums. I probably shouldn't say that. It really comes from these artists. And that's been my humbling experience in this. I mean  I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online. And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is   Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum   And the answer is no. It's to supplement the experience. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you. I decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend Richard Feynman. I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence. And I'm going to tell you the Richard Feynman that I knew. I'm sure there are other people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew  and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman. Richard Feynman was a very complex man. He was a man of many  many parts. He was  of course  foremost  a very  very  very great scientist. He was an actor. You saw him act. I also had the good fortune to be in those lectures  up in the balcony. They were fantastic. He was a philosopher  he was a drum player  he was a teacher par excellence. Richard Feynman was also a showman  an enormous showman. He was brash  irreverent    he was full of macho  a kind of macho one upmanship. He loved intellectual battle. He had a gargantuan ego. But the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom. And what I mean by that is a lot of room  in my case    I can't speak for anybody else    but in my case  a lot of room for another big ego. Well  not as big as his  but fairly big. I always felt good with Dick Feynman. It was always fun to be with him. He always made me feel smart. How can somebody like that make you feel smart  Somehow he did. He made me feel smart. He made me feel he was smart. He made me feel we were both smart  and the two of us could solve any problem whatever. And in fact  we did sometimes do physics together. We never published a paper together  but we did have a lot of fun. He loved to win. With these little macho games we would sometimes play    and he didn't only play them with me  he played them with all sorts of people    he would almost always win. But when he didn't win  when he lost  he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won. I remember once he told me a story about a joke that the students played on him. They took him    I think it was for his birthday    they took him for lunch. They took him for lunch to a sandwich place in Pasadena. It may still exist  I don't know. Celebrity sandwiches was their thing. You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich. You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich. The students went there in advance  and they arranged that they would all order Feynman sandwiches. One after another  they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches. Feynman loved this story. He told me this story  and he was really happy and laughing. When he finished the story  I said to him   Dick  I wonder what would be the difference between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich.  And without skipping a beat at all  he said   Well  they'd be about the same. The only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham   ham  as in bad actor. Well  I happened to have been very quick that day  and I said   Yeah  but a lot less baloney.  The truth of the matter is that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham  but absolutely no baloney. What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense    phoniness  false sophistication  jargon. I remember sometime during the '  s  the mid '  s  Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco at some very rich guy's house    up in San Francisco for dinner. And the last time the rich guy invited us  he also invited a couple of philosophers. These guys were philosophers of mind. Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness. And they were full of all kinds of jargon. I'm trying to remember the words     monism    dualism   categories all over the place. I didn't know what those things meant  neither did Dick    neither did Sydney for that matter. And what did we talk about  Well  what do you talk about when you talk about minds  One thing  there's one obvious thing to talk about    can a machine become a mind  Can you build a machine that thinks like a human being  that is conscious  We sat around and we talked about this    we of course never resolved it. But the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been science iphizing. It's a scientific question after all. And this was a very  very dangerous thing to do around Dick Feynman. Feynman let them have it    both barrels  right between the eyes. It was brutal  it was funny    ooh  it was funny. But it was really brutal. He really popped their balloon. But the amazing thing was    Feynman had to leave a little early. He wasn't feeling too well  so he left a little bit early. And Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers. And the amazing thing is these guys were flying. They were so happy. They had met the great man  they had been instructed by the great man  they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud  and it was something special. I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman  even when he did what he did. Dick  he was my friend. I did call him Dick. Dick and I had a certain  a little bit of a rapport. I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had. We liked each other  we liked the same kind of things. I also liked the kind of intellectual macho games. Sometimes I would win  mostly he would win  but we both enjoyed them. And Dick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality. I don't think he was right. I think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves. But he was convinced of this. And he was curious. The man was incredibly curious. And he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection. And one day we were walking. We were in France. We were in Les Houches. We were up in the mountains      . We were up in the mountains  and Feynman said to me  he said   Leonardo.  The reason he called me Leonardo is because we were in Europe and he was practicing his French. And he said   Leonardo  were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid   And I said   Well  my real hero was my father. He was a working man  had a fifth grade education. He was a master mechanic  and he taught me how to use tools. He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things. He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem. He didn't call it the hypotenuse  he called it the shortcut distance.  And Feynman's eyes just opened up. He went off like a light bulb. And he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father. In fact  he had been convinced at one time that  to be a good physicist  that it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father. I apologize for the sexist conversation here  but this is the way it really happened. He said that he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary    the necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist. Being Dick  he  of course  wanted to check this. He wanted to go out and do an experiment. So  well he did. He went out and did an experiment. He asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists   Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you   And to a man    they were all men    to a man  every single one of them said   My mother.  There went that theory down the trashcan of history. But he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father. And for some time  he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well. I don't know. Maybe. Who knows  But let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist. Feynman's style    no  style is not the right word. Style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing. There's something much deeper than that  but I can't think of another word for it. Feynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest  most elementary solution to a problem that was possible. If it wasn't possible  you had to use something fancier. But no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could. But he also deeply believed  he truly believed  that if you couldn't explain something simply you didn't understand it. In the     s  people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked. There was a theory. It was due to a Russian mathematical physicist  and it was a complicated theory. I'll tell you what that theory was soon enough. It was a terribly complicated theory full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth. And it sort of worked  but it didn't work very well. The only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very  very far apart. The helium atoms had to be very far apart. And unfortunately  the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other. Feynman decided  as a sort of amateur helium physicist  that he would try to figure it out. He had an idea  a very clear idea. He would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like. He would try to visualize it  guided by a small number of simple principles. The small number of simple principles were very  very simple. The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other  they repel. The implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero  it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other. The other fact is that the ground state  the lowest energy state of a quantum system  the wave function is always very smooth    has the minimum number of wiggles. So he sat down    and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil    and he tried to write down  and did write down  the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between. He wrote down a simple thing. It was so simple  in fact  that I suspect a really smart high school student  who didn't even have calculus  could understand what he wrote down. The thing was that that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some. I've always wondered whether the professionals  the real professional helium physicists  were just a little bit embarrassed by this. They had their super powerful technique  and they couldn't do as well. Incidentally  I'll tell you what that super powerful technique was. It was the technique of Feynman diagrams. He did it again in     . In       in my own university    I wasn't there at the time    but in       they were exploring the structure of the proton. The proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles. This was more or less known. And the way to analyze it was  of course  Feynman diagrams. That's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for    to understand particles. The experiments that were going on were very simple. You simply take the proton  and you hit it really sharply with an electron. This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for. The only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated. They're difficult integrals. If you could do all of them  you would have a very precise theory. But you couldn't  they were just too complicated. People were trying to do them. You could do a one loop diagram. Don't worry about one loop. One loop  two loops    maybe you could do a three loop diagram  but beyond that  you couldn't do anything. Feynman said   Forget all of that. Just think of the proton as an assemblage of little particles    a swarm of little particles.  He called them partons. He called them partons. He said   Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast.  Because they're moving real fast  relativity says the internal motions go very slow. The electron hits it suddenly. It's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton. What do you see  You see a frozen bunch of partons. They don't move  and because they don't move during the course of the experiment  you don't have to worry about how they're moving. You don't have to worry about the forces between them. You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons. This was the key to analyzing these experiments. Extremely effective  it really did    somebody said the word revolution is a bad word. I suppose it is  so I won't say revolution    but it certainly evolved very  very deeply our understanding of the proton  and of particles beyond that. Well  I had some more that I was going to tell you about my connection with Feynman  what he was like  but I see I have exactly half a minute. So I think I'll just finish up by saying I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event. I think he would have said   I don't need this.  But how should we honor Feynman  How should we really honor Feynman  I think the answer is we should honor Feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can. Thank you. Think about your day for a second. You woke up  felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door  encountered new colleagues and had great discussions  and felt in awe when you found something new. But I bet there's something you didn't think about today    something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all. And that's that all the sensations  feelings  decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain. Now the brain may not look like much from the outside    a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh  amorphous    but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain  and to see the intricacy of what lies within. And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons. Now unlike a human designed computer  where there's a fairly small number of different parts    we know how they work  because we humans designed them    the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells  maybe tens of thousands. They come in different shapes  they're made out of different molecules. And they project and connect to different brain regions  and they also change different ways in different disease states. Let's make it concrete. There's a class of cells  a fairly small cell  an inhibitory cell  that quiets its neighbors. It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia. It's called the basket cell. And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about. New ones are being discovered everyday. As just a second example  these pyramidal cells  large cells  they can span a significant fraction of the brain. They're excitatory. And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy. Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device. They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs  which then  if they pass a certain threshold  will go to thousands of downstream partners. And this process  which takes just a millisecond or so  happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your     billion cells  as long as you live and think and feel. So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does  Ideally  we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies. If we could activate cells  we could see what powers they can unleash  what they can initiate and sustain. If we could turn them off  then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for. And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today. And honestly  where we've gone through over the last    years  through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off  both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans. Now before I tell you about the technology  the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room  if we live long enough  will encounter  perhaps  a brain disorder. Already  a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them  and the numbers don't do it justice though. These disorders    schizophrenia  Alzheimer's  depression  addiction    they not only steal our time to live  they change who we are. They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people. Now in the   th century  there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders  and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders  practically none of them can be considered to be cured. And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical. This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance. That's also why  perhaps  most of the drugs  and not all  on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too. Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain. And for Parkinson's disease  Cochlear implants  these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder. But electricity also will go in all directions    the path of least resistance  which is where that phrase  in part  comes from. And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix. So again  we're sent back to the idea of ultra precise control. Could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go  So when I started in neuroscience    years ago  I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist  and the first thing I thought about was  if these neurons are electrical devices  all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance. If we could turn on the electricity in one cell  but not its neighbors  that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells  figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded. And also it would allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry. Now how are we going to do that  Well there are many molecules that exist in nature  which are able to convert light into electricity. You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells. If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow  then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light. And their neighbors  which don't have the molecule  would not. There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen  and that's the ability to get light into the brain. And to do that    the brain doesn't feel pain    you can put    taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on    optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate  in animal models for example  in pre clinical studies  these neurons and to see what they do. So how do we do this  Around       in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth  this vision came to fruition. There's a certain alga that swims in the wild  and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally. And it senses light with a little eye spot  which works not unlike how our eye works. In its membrane  or its boundary  it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity. So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins. And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about. When blue light hits it  it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye spot  and that allows this eye spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery. So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons. And because it's a protein  it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism. So all we've got to do is take that DNA  put it into a gene therapy vector  like a virus  and put it into neurons. So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy  and lots of viruses were coming along. So this turned out to be very simple to do. And early in the morning one day in the summer of       we gave it a try  and it worked on the first try. You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron. The neuron uses its natural protein making machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell  like putting solar panels on a roof  and the next thing you know  you have a neuron which can be activated with light. So this is very powerful. One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors. And you can do that  you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others. And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells. This field has now come to be known as optogenetics. And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do  you can take a complex network  use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network. And then when you shine light on the entire network  just that cell type will be activated. So for example  lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier    the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory. If we can deliver that gene to these cells    and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene  of course    and then flash blue light over the entire brain network  just these cells are going to be driven. And when the light turns off  these cells go back to normal  so they don't seem to be averse against that. Not only can you use this to study what these cells do  what their power is in computing in the brain  but you can also use this to try to figure out    well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells  if indeed they're atrophied. Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we're using this  both at the scientific  clinical and pre clinical levels. One of the questions we've confronted is  what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward  Because if you could find those  those would be some of the signals that could drive learning. The brain will do more of whatever got that reward. And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction. So if we could figure out what cells they are  we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against  or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability. So to do that  we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group  where one side of this little box  if the animal goes there  the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light. So if these cells can mediate reward  the animal should go there more and more. And so that's what happens. This animal's going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there  and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that. And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times. These are the dopamine neurons  which some of you may have heard about  in some of the pleasure centers in the brain. Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough  indeed  to drive learning. Now we can generalize the idea. Instead of one point in the brain  we can devise devices that span the brain  that can deliver light into three dimensional patterns    arrays of optical fibers  each coupled to its own independent miniature light source. And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish    like high throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen. Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders. And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post traumatic stress disorder    a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear. And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear. This goes back to the Pavlovian days. It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning    where a tone ends with a brief shock. The shock isn't painful  but it's a little annoying. And over time    in this case  a mouse  which is a good animal model  commonly used in such experiments    the animal learns to fear the tone. The animal will react by freezing  sort of like a deer in the headlights. Now the question is  what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear  So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear. But we activate targets in the brain  different ones  using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide  in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear. And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now. This is an area in the prefrontal cortex  a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states. And the animal's going to hear a tone    and a flash of light occurred there. There's no audio on this  but you can see the animal's freezing. This tone used to mean bad news. And there's a little clock in the lower left hand corner  so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this. And now this next clip is just eight minutes later. And the same tone is going to play  and the light is going to flash again. Okay  there it goes. Right now. And now you can see  just    minutes into the experiment  that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory. Now over the last couple of years  we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off. If we could do that  this could be extremely powerful. If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds  you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded. And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life    every kingdom of life except for animals  we see slightly differently. And we found all sorts of molecules  they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins  that respond to green and yellow light. And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin. Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go. Consider  for example  a condition like epilepsy  where the brain is overactive. Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment  one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain. But that's obviously irreversible  and there could be side effects. What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time  until the seizure dies away  and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state    sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state. So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light  and we beam light in  and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure  we're hoping to be able to turn it off. And so we don't have data to show you on this front  but we're very excited about this. Now I want to close on one story  which we think is another possibility    which is that maybe these molecules  if you can do ultra precise control  can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic  an optical prosthetic. I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon. Seventy five thousand people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted. Maybe         people have Cochlear implants  which allow them to hear. There's another thing  which is you've got to get these genes into cells. And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno associated virus  which probably most of us around this room have  and it doesn't have any symptoms  which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body. And so far  there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus. There's one last elephant in the room  the proteins themselves  which come from algae and bacteria and fungi  and all over the tree of life. Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains  so what is our brain going to do if we put that in  Are the cells going to tolerate it  Will the immune system react  In its early days    these have not been done on humans yet    but we're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this  and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light. So it's early days  to be upfront  but we're excited about it. I wanted to close with one story  which we think could potentially be a clinical application. Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors  our light sensors that are in the back of our eye  are gone. And the retina  of course  is a complex structure. Now let's zoom in on it here  so we can see it in more detail. The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top  and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom  the ganglion cells  relay the information to the brain  where we see that as perception. In many forms of blindness  like retinitis pigmentosa  or macular degeneration  the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed. Now how could you repair this  It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored  because there's nothing for the drug to bind to. On the other hand  light can still get into the eye. The eye is still transparent and you can get light in. So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras. And because there's so many of these cells in the eye  potentially  they could be very high resolution cameras. So this is some work that we're doing. It's being led by one of our collaborators  Alan Horsager at USC  and being sought to be commercialized by a start up company Eos Neuroscience  which is funded by the NIH. And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze. It's a six arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move  or he'll just sit there. And the goal  of course  of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port. Now mice are smart  so this mouse solves the maze eventually  but he does a brute force search. He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform. So he's not using vision to do it. These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans. And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach. So how are we going to solve this  We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide. We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera    just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive. Light is converted to electricity on them. So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus. And now you can see  the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again. And to point out the power of this  these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives. So this pre clinical study  I think  bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future. To close  I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology. We're developing these tools  but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world  so people can study and try to treat different disorders. And our hope is that  by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them  we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier  practically none of which are cured  and in the   st century make them history. Thank you. Juan Enriquez  So some of the stuff is a little dense. But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs  and being able to target those specifically is a first step. The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors  like an on off switch. Ed Boyden  That's right. JE  Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code. EB  Right  yeah. So with blue light  we can drive information  and it's in the form of a one. And by turning things off  it's more or less a zero. So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities. JE  And in theory  that means that  as a mouse feels  smells  hears  touches  you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros. EB  Sure  yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings  and use that to understand more about the brain. JE  Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them  EB  Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard. We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too. So we can record information and then drive information back in    sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing. JE  Well  that might change a couple things. Thank you.  EB  Thank you.  Hello  my name is Thomas Heatherwick. I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings. When I was growing up  I was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale. And I was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications I was seeing felt soulless and cold. And there on the smaller scale  the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument  was a materiality and a soulfulness. And this influenced me. The first building I built was    years ago. And since  in the last    years  I've developed a studio in London. Sorry  this was my mother  by the way  in her bead shop in London. I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that. I'm just going to show  for people who don't know my studio's work  a few projects that we've worked on. This is a hospital building. This is a shop for a bag company. This is studios for artists. This is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and         glass beads the size of a golf ball. And this is a window display. And this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London. And this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk. And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain. And just very quickly  something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again. Because the original Routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with  which had this open platform at the back    in fact  I think all our Routemasters are here in California now actually. But they aren't in London. And so you're stuck on a bus. And if the bus is going to stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop  you're just a prisoner. But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform. So we've been working with Transport for London  and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for    years. And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work. The brief is that the bus should use    percent less energy. So it's got hybrid drive. And we've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics. I was going to show four main projects. And this is a project for a bridge. And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open. And openings seemed    everyone loves opening bridges  but it's quite a basic thing. I think we all kind of stand and watch. But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed    I'm slightly squeamish    but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball. And as he was diving  someone had stamped on his knee  and it had broken like this. And then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken. And so this is in Paddington in London. And it's a very boring bridge  as you can see. It's just steel and timber. But instead of what it is  our focus was on the way it worked. So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other. We actually had to halve its speed  because everyone was too scared when we first did it. So that's it speeded up. A project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station    so a power station that uses organic waste material. In the news  the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time. And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power. But recently  any annual report of a power company doesn't have a power station on it. It has a child running through a field  or something like that. And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station  our condition was that we would work with them and that  whatever we did  we were not just going to decorate a normal power station. And instead  we had to learn    we kind of forced them to teach us. And so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements  and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on. That just taking a field and banging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work. So we looked at how we could compose all those elements    instead of just litter  create one composition. And what we found    this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain. It was voted the worst place in Britain to live. And there are       new homes being built next to this power station. So it felt this has a social dimension. It has a symbolic importance. And we should be proud of where our power is coming from  rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of. So we were looking at how we could make a power station  that  instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside  could be a place that pulls you in. And it has to be    I'm trying to get my        feet high. So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in  and using the spare soil that's there on the site  we could make a power station that was silent as well. Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference. And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost effective way of making a structure to do this. The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station. It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top. And it's a power park. So people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area  and use that height that we have to have for its function. In Shanghai  we were invited to build    well we weren't invited  what am I talking about. We won the competition  and it was painful to get there. So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion. And an expo is a totally bonkers thing. There's     pavilions. It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened. So there are up to a million people there everyday. And     countries all competing. And the British government saying   You need to be in the top five.  And so that became the governmental goal    is  how do you stand out in this chaos  which is an expo of stimulus  So our sense was we had to do one thing  and only one thing  instead of trying to have everything. And so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain. But the thing that was true  the expo was about the future of cities  and particularly the Victorians pioneered integrating nature into the cities. And the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain. And the world's first major botanical institution is in London  and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting    percent of all the world's plant species. So we suddenly realized that there was this thing. And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful  and I've never met anyone who says   I don't like trees.  And the same with flowers. I've never met anyone who says   I don't like flowers.  But we realized that seeds    there's been this very serious project happening    but that seeds    at these major botanical gardens  seeds aren't on show. But you just have to go to a garden center  and they're in little paper packets. But this phenomenal project's been happening. So we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds  some kind of seed cathedral. But how could we show these teeny weeny things  And the film  Jurassic Park  actually really helped us. Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious  rather than looking like nuts. So the challenge was  how are we going to bring light and expose these things  We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content. So we were trying to think  how could we make a whole thing emanate. By the way  we had half the budget of the other Western nations. So that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch. And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue. Song    We've got the Mop Tops  the Play Doh Mop Tops     Just turn the chair and grow Play Doh hair     They're the Mop Tops   Thomas Heatherwick  Okay  you get the idea. So the idea was to take these        seeds that they agreed to give us  and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box  very simple box element  and make it a building that could move in the wind. So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows. And inside  the daylight    each one is an optic and it brings light into the center. And by night  artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside. And to make the project affordable  we focused our energy. Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch  we focused it on this one element. And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else  and focus our energy on that. And so the rest of the site was a public space. And with a million people there a day  it just felt like offering some public space. We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini me version of the seed cathedral  so that  even if you're partially sighted  that it was kind of crunchy and soft  that piece of landscape that you see there. And then  you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur    in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral  in effect  we've shaved it. And inside there's nothing  there's no famous actor's voice  there's no projections  there's no televisions  there's no color changing. There's just silence and a cool temperature. And if a cloud goes past  you can see a cloud on the tips where it's letting the light through. This is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings. A key thing was how people would interact. I mean  in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo. And I just wanted to show you. The British government    any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have. And there was a lot of terror. But there was an underlying support. And so there was a moment when suddenly    actually  the next thing. This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment  who was our client  with the Chinese children  using the landscape. TH  I'm sorry about my stupid voice there. So finally  texture is something. In the projects we've been working on  these slick buildings  where they might be a fancy shape  but the materiality feels the same  is something that we've been trying to research really  and explore alternatives. And the project that we're building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer. And it's in a piece of land that's this site. And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur said that  if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city  they would give them more gross floor area  buildable. So there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city. And the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower  and you squeeze a few trees around the edge  and you see cars parked. It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience  and the rest of it is just for postcards. The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this. So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom  we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer. And by linking these together  we could have    percent of the site as a rainforest  instead of only    percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings. So we're building these buildings. They're actually identical  so it's quite cost effective. They're just chopped at different heights. But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape  rather than engulf it. And that's my final slide. Thank you. Thank you. June Cohen  So thank you. Thank you  Thomas. You're a delight. Since we have an extra minute here  I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds  which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building. TH  These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure. So there were        of these. This optic was    feet long. And so the daylight was just coming    it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed. Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy. Because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway  but if you say you're going to drill        holes in it    we had quite a time. There was one person in the contractors who was the right size    and it wasn't a child    who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building. JC  Thank you  Thomas. I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist  so I put children to sleep for a living. And I'm an academic  so I put audiences to sleep for free. But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto. And it's from the experience from about    or    years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning  that pain is a disease. Now most of the time  you think of pain as a symptom of a disease  and that's true most of the time. It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation. But about    percent of the time  after the patient has recovered from one of those events  pain persists. It persists for months and oftentimes for years  and when that happens  it is its own disease. And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it  I want to show you how it feels for my patients. So imagine  if you will  that I'm stroking your arm with this feather  as I'm stroking my arm right now. Now  I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this. Please keep your seat. A very different feeling. Now what does it have to do with chronic pain  Imagine  if you will  these two ideas together. Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather  but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling    and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain. In fact  imagine something even worse. Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather  and their brain  was  telling them that they were feeling this hot torch. That was the experience of my patient  Chandler  whom you see in the photograph. As you can see  she's a beautiful  young woman. She was    years old last year when I met her  and she aspired to be a professional dancer. And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals  she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist. Now you would probably imagine  as she did  that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life. Wrap it in an ACE bandage  take some ibuprofen for a week or two  and that's the end of the story. But in Chandler's case  that was the beginning of the story. This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain. You can see that the arm is discolored  purplish in color. It was cadaverically cold to the touch. The muscles were frozen  paralyzed    dystonic is how we refer to that. The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands  to her fingertips  from her wrist up to her elbow  almost all the way to her shoulder. But the worst part was  not the spontaneous pain that was there    hours a day. The worst part was that she had allodynia  the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch. The lightest touch of her arm    the touch of a hand  the touch even of a sleeve  of a garment  as she put it on    caused excruciating  burning pain. How can the nervous system get this so wrong  How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame  Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. In your house  wires run in the wall  from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb. And when you turn the switch on  the light goes on. And when you turn the switch off  the light goes off. So people imagine the nervous system is just like that. If you hit your thumb with a hammer  these wires in your arm    that  of course  we call nerves    transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires  new nerves  take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt. But the situation  of course  in the human body is far more complicated than that. Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one on one fashion  in fact  what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions    laterally  vertically  up and down in the spinal cord    and they start interacting with other adjacent cells. These cells  called glial cells  were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together  like the nerves. But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation  amplification and  in the case of pain  the distortion of sensory experiences. These glial cells become activated. Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins  which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves  and they start releasing their neurotransmitters  and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells  and so on and so forth  until what we have is a positive feedback loop. It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch  the toilet flushed three doors down  or your dishwasher went on  or your computer monitor turned off. That's crazy  but that's  in fact  what happens with chronic pain. And that's why pain becomes its own disease. The nervous system has plasticity. It changes  and it morphs in response to stimuli. Well  what do we do about that  What can we do in a case like Chandler's  We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time. We treat them with symptom modifying drugs    painkillers    which are  frankly  not very effective for this kind of pain. We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet  and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics. And most importantly  what we do is we use a rigorous  and often uncomfortable  process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life. And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency  despair and depression that always accompanies severe  chronic pain. It's successful  as you can see from this video of Chandler  who  two months after we first met her  is now doings a back flip. And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here  and she's doing absolutely fantastic. But the future is actually even brighter. The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem  as we have now  but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells  or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate  that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up  or plasticity  that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain. So I have hope that in the future  the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized  who said   My philosophy  No pain  no pain.  Thank you very much. So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world. And it's not a trip that requires light years of travel  but it's to a place where it's defined by light. So it's a little appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light. I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence. I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs. I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution. But mostly I'm entranced by it. Since my my first dive in a deep diving submersible  when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays  I've been a bioluminescence junky. But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words  and they were totally inadequate to the task. I needed some way to share the experience directly. And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called Deep Rover. This next video clip  you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence. And the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across. a mess screen will come into contact with the soft bodied creatures of the deep sea. With the sub's lights switched off  it is possible to see their bioluminescence    the light produced when they collide with the mesh. This is the first time it has ever been recorded. Edith Widder  So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark adapted human eye. Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible. But just to try to prove that fact to you  I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration. So  if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible  I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it. And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now  either because they're dead    or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like. Oops. Sorry. I spend most of my time working in the dark  I'm used to that. Okay. So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate  a single celled alga. So why would a single celled alga need to be able to produce light  Well  it uses it to defend itself from its predators. The flash is like a scream for help. It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm  and just like the alarm on your car or your house  it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder  thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away. There's a lot of animals that use this trick  for example this black dragonfish. It's got a light organ under its eye. It's got a chin barbel. It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see  but you'll see in here in a minute. So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime  because the top speed of this fish is one knot  which was the top speed of the submersible. But it was worth it  because we caught it in a special capture device  brought it up into the lab on the ship  and then everything on this fish lights up. It's unbelievable. The light organs under the eyes are flashing. That chin barbel is flashing. It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing  fin lights. It's a scream for help  it's meant to attract attention. It's phenomenal. And you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets. There's other ways you can defend yourself with light. For example  this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud. This blinds or distracts the predator. This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this. Now it may look like a tasty morsel  or a pig's head with wings    but if it's attacked  it puts out a barrage of light    in fact  a barrage of photon torpedoes. I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing. It's phenomenal. So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean    most of them that make light. And we have a pretty good idea  for most of them  why. They use it for finding food  for attracting mates  for defending against predators. But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean  that's where things get really strange. And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in  Avatar   but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them. They're things like this. This is a golden coral  a bush. It grows very slowly. In fact  it's thought that some of these are as much as       years old  which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed. The other reason is this amazing bush glows. So if you brush up against it  any place you brushed against it  you get this twinkling blue green light that's just breathtaking. And you see things like this. This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book    just all manner of creatures all over this thing. And these are flytrap anemones. Now if you poke it  it pulls in its tentacles. But if you keep poking it  it starts to produce light. And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy. It produces these strings of light  presumably as some form of defense. There are starfish that can make light. And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms. This looks like a plant  but it's actually an animal. And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock. So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents  as you see here. But if we collect it very gently  and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock  it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume  changing color as it goes  from green to blue. Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure. But we have no idea why it does that. Here's another one. This is also a sea pen. It's got a brittle star hitching a ride. It's a green saber of light. And like the one you just saw  it can produce these as bands of light. So if I squeeze the base  the bands go from base to tip. If I squeeze the tip  they go from tip to base. So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle  I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about. So there's a language of light in the deep ocean  and we're just beginning to understand it  and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays. This is an optical lure that I've used. We call it the electronic jellyfish. It's just    blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays. And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye in the Sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals  so it's unobtrusive. So I just want to show you some of the responses we've elicited from animals in the deep sea. So the camera's black and white. It's not high resolution. And what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of    like the cockroaches of the ocean    there are isopods all over it. And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish. And when it starts flashing  it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast. But as soon as it starts to flash    and it's going to look big  because it blooms on the camera    I want you to look right here. There's something small there that responds. We're talking to something. It looks like a little of string pearls basically    in fact  three strings of pearls. And this was very consistent. This was in the Bahamas at about       feet. We basically have a chat room going on here  because once it gets started  everybody's talking. And I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water. But the cool thing is  we're talking to it. We don't know what we're saying. Personally  I think it's something sexy. And then finally  I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep sea webcam  which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year. We've only just begun to analyze all of this data. This is going to be a glowing source first  which is like bioluminescent bacteria. And it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean. So this scavenger comes in  which is a giant sixgill shark. And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in  because there's bait right there. But if it had been following the odor plume  it would have come in from the other direction. And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish. That's a    foot long giant sixgill shark. Okay  so this next one is from the webcam  and it's going to be this pinwheel display. And this is a burglar alarm. And that was a Humboldt squid  a juvenile Humboldt squid  about three feet long. This is at       feet in Monterey Canyon. But if it's a burglar alarm  you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly. It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish. But we did see a bunch of responses like this. This guy is a little more contemplative.  Hey  wait a minute. There's supposed to be something else there.  He's thinking about it. But he's persistent. He keeps coming back. And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more  and thinks   Maybe if I come in from a different angle.  Nope. So we are starting to get a handle on this  but only just the beginnings. We need more eyes on the process. So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible  by all means  climb in and take the plunge. This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list  because we live on an ocean planet. More than    percent     percent  of the living space on our planet is ocean. It's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures  alien life forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see. But if you do take the plunge  please remember to turn out the lights. But I warn you  it's addictive. Thank you. I'm used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective  intelligent  intellectual  savvy  worldly and innovative people in the world. And I think that's true. However  I also have reason to believe that many  if not most  of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly. Now I know that seems ludicrous. I know that seems ludicrous. And believe me  I lived the same sad life until about three years ago. And what happened to me was I bought  what was for me  a very expensive pair of shoes. But those shoes came with round nylon laces  and I couldn't keep them tied. So I went back to the store and said to the owner   I love the shoes  but I hate the laces.  He took a look and said   Oh  you're tying them wrong.  Now up until that moment  I would have thought that  by age     one of the life skills that I had really nailed was tying my shoes. But not so    let me demonstrate. This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes. Now as it turns out    thank you. Wait  there's more. As it turns out    there's a strong form and a weak form of this knot  and we were taught the weak form. And here's how to tell. If you pull the strands at the base of the knot  you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe. That's the weak form of the knot. But not to worry. If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow  we get this  the strong form of the knot. And if you pull the cords under the knot  you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe. This is a stronger knot. It will come untied less often. It will let you down less  and not only that  it looks better. We're going to do this one more time. Start as usual    go the other way around the loop. This is a little hard for children  but I think you can handle it. Pull the knot. There it is  the strong form of the shoe knot. Now  in keeping with today's theme  I'd like to point out    something you already know    that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else. Live long and prosper. So I think data can actually make us more human. We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives  and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories. Recently  a wise media theorist Tweeted   The   th century culture was defined by the novel  the   th century culture was defined by the cinema  and the culture of the   st century will be defined by the interface.  And I believe this is going to prove true. Our lives are being driven by data  and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories. So I'm going to show you a few of the projects that I've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems. This is a project called Flight Patterns. What you're looking at is airplane traffic over North America for a    hour period. As you see  everything starts to fade to black  and you see people going to sleep. Followed by that  you see on the West coast planes moving across  the red eye flights to the East coast. And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast  followed by European flights coming in the upper right hand corner. Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast. You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left hand corner. I think it's one thing to say there's         planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time  and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows. This is a time lapse image of that exact same data  but I've color coded it by type  so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us. And I started making these  and I put them into Google Maps and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports and the patterns that are occurring there. So here we can see the white represents low altitudes  and the blue are higher altitudes. And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta. You can see this is a major shipping airport  and there's all kinds of activity there. You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer. See again  the diversity. And you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have. This is scrolling up the East coast. You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other. So zooming back out real quick  we see  again  the U.S.    you get Florida down in the right hand corner. Moving across to the West coast  you see San Francisco and Los Angeles    big low traffic zones across Nevada and Arizona. And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom. I started taking a look as well at different perimeters  because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data. This is looking at ascending versus descending flights. And you can see  over time  the ways the airports change. You see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen. And you can see  eventually the airport actually flips directions. So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT. This is visualizing international communications. So it's how New York communicates with other international cities. And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition. And it had a live feed with a    hour offset  so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through AT T's data and revealing itself. This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.org. And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam. So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city  until we approach New Year's Eve  where everybody says   Happy New Year   So this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city. This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day. So again  you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city. And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before  which happens right here. And then you can see people celebrating the next day. And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases. So now on to something completely different. Some of you may recognize this. This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine. And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well  except for one thing  it's not a robot at all. There's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player. This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon called the Mechanical Turk    named after this guy. And it's based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people  but really difficult for computers. So they made this web service and said   Any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people.  The nerdy side of me thought   Wow  this is amazing. I can tap into thousands of people's minds.  And the other nerdy side of me thought   This is horrible. This is completely bizarre. What does this mean for the future of mankind  where we're all plugged into this borg   I was probably being a little extreme. But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on  and we're just doing these little labors  So I created this drawing tool. I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left. And I said   I'll pay you two cents for your contribution.  And I started collecting sheep. And I collected a lot  a lot of different sheep. Lots of sheep. I took the first        sheep that I collected  and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com where you can actually buy collections of    sheep. You can't pick individual sheep  but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity. And juxtaposed against this grid  you see actually  by rolling over each individual one  the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. I think there's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil    something we can all relate to  this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing. I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid. Kind of amazing what some people did. So here's a few statistics from the project. Approximate collection rate of    sheep per hour  which would make a working wage of    cents per hour. There were     rejected sheep that didn't meet  sheep like  criteria and were thrown out of the flock. The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to    minutes. That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication. And there were       people that contributed to the project  or were unique IP addresses    so about how many people contributed. But only one of them out of the       said this. Which I was pretty surprised by. I expected people to be wondering   Why did I draw a sheep   And I think it's a pretty valid question. And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep. Sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts  the first to be selectively bred for production traits  the first animal to be cloned. Obviously  we think of sheep as followers. And there's this reference to  Le Petit Prince  where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep. He draws sheep after sheep. The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box. And he says   It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep. It's about your own interpretation and doing something different.  And I like that. So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's  Modern Times.  It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the Industrial Revolution. So there were no longer shoe makers  but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes. And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot. So I thought this was an interesting clip to divide into    pieces and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool. This basically allowed    what you see on the left side is the original frame  and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by    people who have no idea what it is they're doing. And this was the inspiration for a project that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima. We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for  which is making money. So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into        teeny pieces  and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk. We asked people to draw what it was that they saw. But here there was no sheep like criteria. People  if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face  it actually made it into the bill. So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do. So we took these hundred dollar bills  and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com  where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions. And you can also trade real hundred dollar bills for fake hundred dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project  which is now known as One Laptop Per Child. This is again showing all the different contributions. You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings  like this one on top    spent a long time making realistic versions. And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces. Here on the right hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing     .      Really   That's all I'm getting paid for this  So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about is called Bicycle Built for     . This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey. You may recognize these two guys. This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '  s  where they created the song  Daisy Bell   which was the world's first singing computer. You may recognize it from        A Space Odyssey.  When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song  as a reference to when computers became human. So we resynthesized this song. This is what that sounded like. We broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing. Daisy Bell    Daisy  Daisy ...   Aaron Koblin  And we took all of those individual pieces  and we fed them into another Turk request. This is what it would look like if you went to the site. You type in your code  but you first test your mic. You'd be fed a simple audio clip. And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice. After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted  you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context. And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. Recording    Daisy  Daisy     give me your answer do     I'm half crazy     all for the love of you     It can't be a stylish marriage     I can't afford a carriage     But you'll look sweet upon the seat     of a bicycle built for two   AK  So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds  that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual. We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative  distributed music making  where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on. So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together. I'm sorry for this. Chorus    Daisy  Daisy     Give me your answer do     I'm half crazy     all for the love of you     It can't be a stylish marriage     I can't afford a carriage     But you'd look sweet upon the seat     of a bicycle built for two   AK  So stepping back for a quick second  when I was at UCLA going to grad school  I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing. And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners. So basically motion through  D space. And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost who said   Wait a minute. You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video   So we did exactly that. We made a music video for one of my favorite bands  Radiohead. And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers  but we also open sourced it  and we made it released as a Google Code project  where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it. And people were making some amazing things. This is actually two of my favorites  the pin board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke. A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content. More recently  somebody even  D printed Thom Yorke's head  which is a little creepy  but pretty cool. So with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on  I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something. And I met a music video director named Chris Milk. And we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project. But we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for. So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months. And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin  who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album called  Ain't No Grave.  The lyrics to the leading track are  Ain't no grave can hold my body down.  So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash. So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello  also known as Mr. doob  who's a much better programmer than I am  and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool. As you know  an animation is a series of images. So what we did was cross cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash  and at eight frames a second  we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video. So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you  but I want to show you two short clips. One is the beginning of the music video. And that's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly.   can hold my body down     There ain't no grave     can hold body down     When I hear the trumpet sound     I'm going to ride right out of the ground     Ain't no grave     can hold my body ...   AK  What better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs. Collaborator  I felt really sad when he died. And I just thought it'd be wonderful  it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory. Collaborator Two  It really allows this last recording of his to be a living  breathing memorial. Collaborator Three  For all of the frames to be drawn by fans  each individual frame  it's got a very powerful feeling to it. Collaborator Four  I've seen everybody from Japan  Venezuela  to the States  to Knoxville  Tennessee. Collaborator Five  As much as is different from frame to frame  it really is personal. Collaborator Six  Watching the video in my room  I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it. And I just worked and worked through problems  until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves. You can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing  and a lot of light and dark comes into it. And in a weird way  that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well. It's the sum total of his life  all the things that had happened    the bad things  the good things. You're hearing a person's life. AK  So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com  what you'll see is the video playing above. And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project. So this isn't finished at all  but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate. If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails  you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located. And if you find one that you're interested in  you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you're able to rate that frame  which helps it bubble up to the top. And you can also see the way that it was drawn. Again  you can get the playback and personal contribution. In addition to that  it's listed  the artist's name  the location  how long they spent drawing it. And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged  Abstract.  But there's a bunch of different styles. And you can sort the video a number of different ways. You can say   I want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version. And then this is  again  the abstract version  which ends up getting a little bit crazy. So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk. And this is called  The Wilderness Downtown.  It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire. Chris and I were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers  where you have HTML  audio and video and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast. And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web beyond the four by three or sixteen by nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen. But most importantly  I think  we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project  where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone. What if we had a very low commitment  but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed  So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up. And you type in the address    it actually creates a music video specifically for you  pulling in Google maps and Streetview images into the experience itself. So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address  but I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect.   Now our lives are changing fast     Hope that something pure can last     Hope that something pure can last     Ooh we used to wait     Ooh we used to wait     Ooh we used to wait     Sometimes it never came     Sometimes it never came     Still moving through the pain     We used to wait for it     We used to wait for it     We used to wait for it   AK  So I think  if there's one thing to take away from my talk today  it's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device. And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data  we have an opportunity  and maybe even an obligation  to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together. Thanks a lot. I want to share with you over the next    minutes a pretty incredible idea. Actually  it's a really big idea. But to get us started  I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world. Now I bet  in this audience  you're thinking of some really incredible technology  some stuff that I haven't even heard of  I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure  pretty sure  that absolutely nobody is thinking of this. This is a polio vaccine. And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted. This is a great technology. We can take it completely for granted. But it wasn't always that way. Even here in California  if we were to go back just a few years  it was a very different story. People were terrified of this disease. They were terrified of polio  and it would cause public panic. And it was because of scenes like this. In this scene  people are living in an iron lung. These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before  and then two days later  they can no longer breathe  and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs  but also their breathing muscles. And they were going to spend the rest of their lives  usually  in this iron lung to breathe for them. This disease was terrifying. There was no cure  and there was no vaccine. The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it. Twenty years later  they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine. It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late     s. Finally  a vaccine that could stop this awful disease  and here in the United States it had an incredible impact. As you can see  the virus stopped  and it stopped very  very fast. But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world. And it happened so fast in the United States  however  that even just last month Jon Stewart said this  Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated. Bruce Aylward  Oops. Jon  polio's almost been eradicated. But the reality is that polio still exists today. We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists. This is the picture. There's not very much left in the world. But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes  almost unknown  I'm sure to most of you here today. It's been working for    years to try and eradicate this disease  and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic. But just last year  we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio. And this is the reason  in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade  on opposite sides of the globe  there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks. Hundreds of people were paralyzed. Hundreds of people died    children as well as adults. And in both cases  we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses  and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries. They had come from thousands of miles away. And in one case  it originated on another continent. And not only that  but when they came into these countries  then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia  where  for the first time in over a decade last year  children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years. Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you  these are under control now  and it looks like they'll probably stop very  very quickly. But the message was very clear. Polio is still a devastating  explosive disease. It's just happening in another part of the world. And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership  the Polio Partnership  is trying to do. We're not trying to control polio. We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases  because this disease is like a root fire  it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely. So what we're looking for is a permanent solution. We want a world in which every child  just like you guys  can take for granted a polio free world. So we're looking for a permanent solution  and this is where we get lucky. This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary. This virus can only survive in people. It can't live for a very long time in people. It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all. And we've got pretty good vaccines  as I've just showed you. So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely. What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth. Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this  to eradicating diseases. It's been tried six times in the last century  and it's been successful exactly once. And this is because disease eradication  it's still the venture capital of public health. The risks are massive  but the pay off    economic  humanitarian  motivational    it's absolutely huge. One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every    days    in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs. And if we can finish polio eradication  the poorest countries in the world are going to save over    billion dollars in the next    years alone. So those are the kind of stakes that we're after. But smallpox eradication was hard  it was very  very hard. And polio eradication  in many ways  is even tougher  and there's a few reasons for that. The first is that  when we started trying to eradicate polio about    years ago  more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox. And there were more than    times as many people living in these countries. So it was a massive effort. The second challenge we had was    in contrast to the smallpox vaccine  which was very stable  and a single dose protected you for life    the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile. It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat  and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child    it's not potent  it's not going to protect them. Even then  kids need many doses of the vaccine. But the third challenge we have    and probably even bigger one  the biggest challenge    is that  in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy    every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash. So you could get around the disease  you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off. With polio it's almost completely different. The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease. So you can't see the enemy most of the time  and as a result  we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox. We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history. There's over    million people  probably    million people  largely volunteers  who have been working over the last    years in what has now been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime. These people  these    million people  vaccinate over     million children every single year  multiple times at the peak of our operation. Now giving the polio vaccine is simple. It's just two drops  like that. But reaching     million people is much  much tougher. And these vaccinators  these volunteers  they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest  densest urban slums in the world. They've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote  difficult to reach places in the world. And they also have to dodge bullets  because we have got to operate during shaky cease fires and truces to try and vaccinate children  even in areas affected by conflict. One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago    a place which has eradicated polio  not once  but twice  because they got reinfected. He was sitting outside of the road  watching one of these polio campaigns unfold  and a few months later he wrote   This is foreign aid at its most heroic.  And these heroes  they come from every walk of life  all sorts of backgrounds. But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International. This is a group whose million strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over    years. They're right at the center of the whole thing. Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication    more than    years  much longer than it should have    but once it was built  the results were striking. Within a couple of years  every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses  with the exception of four countries that you see here. And in each of those  it was only part of the country. And then  by       one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide    proof of concept. And then today  there's been a    percent reduction    greater than    percent reduction    in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease. When we started  over    years ago        children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus. Last year  it was      . And at the same time  the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas. It's been working to help control pandemic flu  SARS for example. It's also tried to save children by doing other things    giving vitamin A drops  giving measles shots  giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns. But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us  the international community  to reach every single child  every single community  the most vulnerable people in the world  with the most basic of health services  irrespective of geography  poverty  culture and even conflict. So things were looking very exciting  and then about five years ago  this virus  this ancient virus  started to fight back. The first problem we ran into was that  in these last four countries  the strongholds of this virus  we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out. And then to make the matters even worse  the virus started to spread out of these four places  especially northern India and northern Nigeria  into much of Africa  Asia  and even into Europe  causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades. And then  in one of the most important  tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world  we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have. In conditions like this  the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to. Now at that time  there was a great  as you can imagine  frustration    let's call it frustration    it started to grow very  very quickly. And all of a sudden  some very important voices in the world of public health started to say   Hang on. We should abandon this idea of eradication. Let's settle for control    that's good enough.  Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds  it's a false premise. The brutal truth is  if we don't have the will or the skill  or even the money that we need to reach children  the most vulnerable children in the world  with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine  then pretty soon  more than         children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year. There's absolutely no question. These are children like Umar. Umar is seven years old  and he's from northern Nigeria. He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters. Umar also has polio. Umar was paralyzed for life. His right leg was paralyzed in     . This leg  his right leg  now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl  because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends  keep up with his brothers and sisters  than to get up on his crutches and walk. But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid. As you probably can't see the detail here  but this is his report card  and you'll see  he's got perfect scores. He got     percent in all the important things  like nursery rhymes  for example there. But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days  but it's not true. Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances. The reality of polio today is something very different. Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world. It leaves their children paralyzed  and it drags their families deeper into poverty  because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have  trying in vain to find a cure for their children. We think children deserve better. And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago  when people were saying   We should call it off   the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions  new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again. In northern India  we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this  so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters  so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services. In northern Nigeria  the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders  they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence. And now they've even started using these devices    speaking of cool technology    these little devices  little GIS trackers like this  which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators. And then they can track them  and at the end of the day  they look and see  did these guys get every single street  every single house. This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing. And in Afghanistan  we're trying new approaches    access negotiators. We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child. But as we tried these extraordinary things  as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics  we went back to the vaccine    it's a    year old vaccine    and we thought  surely we can make a better vaccine  so that when they finally get to these kids  we can have a better bang for our buck. And this started an incredible collaboration with industry  and within six months  we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted  just two years ago  the last two types of polio in the world. Now June the ninth        we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine  and it turned out to be a game changer. The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had  and we immediately started using this. Well  in a couple of months we had to get it out of production. And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world. And we didn't start with the easy places. The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan  because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this. Now here at TED  over the last couple of days  I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible. So this morning at about seven o'clock  I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again  so that you could see something that's just unfolding today  which proves that the impossible is possible. And only two years ago  people were saying that this is impossible. Now remember  northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio. Over         children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio    Uttar Pradesh and Bihar            children every single month. Sanitation is terrible  and our old vaccine  you remember  worked half as well as it should have. And yet  the impossible is happening. Today marks exactly six months    and for the first time in history  not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. India's not unique. In Umar's home country of Nigeria  a    percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year. And in the last six months  we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history. Ladies and gentlemen  with a combination of smart people  smart technology and smart investments  polio can now be eradicated anywhere. We have major challenges  you can imagine  to finish this job  but as you've also seen  it's doable  it has great secondary benefits  and polio eradication is a great buy. And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus  it's a stark reminder that we are failing  as a society  to reach children with the most basic of services. And for that reason  polio eradication  it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice. The huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children. It's ready to reach them with bed nets  with other things. But capitalizing on their enthusiasm  capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started    years ago. Finishing polio is a smart thing to do  and it's the right thing to do. Now we're in tough times economically. But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio   There's never a wrong time to do the right thing.  Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do. And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last    years. We have a new vaccine  we have new resolve  and we have new tactics. We have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history. But if we blink now  we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease. Here's a great idea to spread  End polio now. Help us tell the story. Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child  every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever. Thank you. Bill Gates  Well Bruce  where do you think the toughest places are going to be  Where would you say we need to be the smartest  BA  The four places where you saw  that we've never stopped    northern Nigeria  northern India  the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan    they're going to be the toughest. But the interesting thing is  of those three  India's looking real good  as you just saw in the data. And Afghanistan  Afghanistan  we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly. It keeps getting reinfected. So the tough ones  going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished. They're going to be the tough ones. BG  Now what about the money  Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year. And is it easy to raise that money  And what's it going to be like the next couple of years  BA  It's interesting. We spend right now about     million to     million dollars a year. That's what it costs to reach     million children. It sounds like a lot of money  it is a lot of money. But when you're reaching     million children multiple times           cents to reach a child    that's not very much money. But right now we don't have enough of that. We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners  and every time we cut corners  more places get infected that shouldn't have  and it just slows us down. And that great buy costs us a little bit more. BG  Well  hopefully we'll get the word out  and the governments will keep their generosity up. So good luck. We're all in this with you. Thank you.  BA  Thank you.  The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist  as an Iranian woman artist  as an Iranian woman artist living in exile. Well  it has its pluses and minuses. On the dark side  politics doesn't seem to escape people like me. Every Iranian artist  in one form or another  is political. Politics have defined our lives. If you're living in Iran  you're facing censorship  harassment  arrest  torture    at times  execution. If you're living outside like me  you're faced with life in exile    the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family. Therefore  we don't find the moral  emotional  psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility. Oddly enough  an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice  the speaker of my people  even if I have  indeed  no access to my own country. Also  people like myself  we're fighting two battles on different grounds. We're being critical of the West  the perception of the West about our identity    about the image that is constructed about us  about our women  about our politics  about our religion. We are there to take pride and insist on respect. And at the same time  we're fighting another battle. That is our regime  our government    our atrocious government   that  has done every crime in order to stay in power. Our artists are at risk. We are in a position of danger. We pose a threat to the order of the government. But ironically  this situation has empowered all of us  because we are considered  as artists  central to the cultural  political  social discourse in Iran. We are there to inspire  to provoke  to mobilize  to bring hope to our people. We are the reporters of our people  and are communicators to the outside world. Art is our weapon. Culture is a form of resistance. I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression. For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics. From the fact that they are only serving one audience  mainly the Western culture. But also  I worry about the West  because often in this country  in this Western world that we have  culture risks being a form of entertainment. Our people depend on our artists  and culture is beyond communication. My journey as an artist started from a very  very personal place. I did not start to make social commentary about my country. The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good    years. It was after the Islamic Revolution of     . While I was absent from Iran  the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture. I came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that I found my place in the society. But instead  I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn't recognize anymore. More so  I became very interested  as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions  I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution    how  indeed  it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women. I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting  in the way the women of Iran  historically  seemed to embody the political transformation. So in a way  by studying a woman  you can read the structure and the ideology of the country. So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life  and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse    the subject of martyrdom  the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God  faith  but violence and crime and cruelty. For me  this became incredibly important. And yet  I had an unusual position toward this. I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place  but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution. This changed slowly as I found my voice and I discovered things that I didn't know I would discover. So my art became slightly more critical. My knife became a little sharper. And I fell into a life in exile. I am a nomadic artist. I work in Morocco  in Turkey  in Mexico. I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran. Now I am making films. Last year  I finished a film called  Women Without Men.   Women Without Men  returns to history  but another part of our Iranian history. It goes to      when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader  Dr. Mossadegh. The book is written by an Iranian woman  Shahrnush Parsipur. It's a magical realist novel. This book is banned  and she spent five years in prison. My obsession with this book  and the reason I made this into a film  is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female    traditionally  historically in Iran    and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change  freedom and democracy    while the country of Iran  equally  as if another character  also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions. I made this film because I felt it's important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country. That all of you seem to remember Iran after the Islamic Revolution. That Iran was once a secular society  and we had democracy  and this democracy was stolen from us by the American government  by the British government. This film also speaks to the Iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized    in the way we looked  in the way we played music  in the way we had intellectual life. And most of all  in the way that we fought for democracy. These are some of the shots actually from my film. These are some of the images of the coup. And we made this film in Casablanca  recreating all the shots. This film tried to find a balance between telling a political story  but also a feminine story. Being a visual artist  indeed  I am foremost interested to make art    to make art that transcends politics  religion  the question of feminism  and become an important  timeless  universal work of art. The challenge I have is how to do that. How to tell a political story but an allegorical story. How to move you with your emotions  but also make your mind work. These are some of the images and the characters of the film. Now comes the green movement    the summer of       as my film is released    the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran. What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film  the cry for democracy and social justice  repeats itself now again in Tehran. The green movement significantly inspired the world. It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy. What was most significant for me was  once again  the presence of the women. They're absolutely inspirational for me. If in the Islamic Revolution  the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn't have a voice  now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of Tehran    women who were educated  forward thinking  non traditional  sexually open  fearless and seriously feminist. These women and those young men united Iranians across the world  inside and outside. I then discovered why I take so much inspiration from Iranian women. That  under all circumstances  they have pushed the boundary. They have confronted the authority. They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way. And once again  they proved themselves. I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice  and their voice is giving me my voice. And it's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist  even if I have to operate in the West only for now. Thank you so much. A few weeks ago  I had a chance to go to Saudi Arabia. And the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim was go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba  the holiest shrine of Islam. And I did that  I put on my ritualistic dress  I went to the holy mosque  I did my prayers  I observed all the rituals. And meanwhile  besides all the spirituality  there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba that was pretty interesting for me. There was no separation of sexes. In other words  men and women were worshiping all together. They were together while doing the tawaf  the circular walk around the Kaaba. They were together while praying. And if you wonder why this is interesting at all  you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia because it's a country which is strictly divided between the sexes. In other words  as men  you are not simply supposed to be in the same physical space with women. And I noticed this in a very funny way. I left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca. I headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant. And I went there    I noticed that there was a male section  which was carefully separated from the female section. And I had to pay  order and eat at the male section.  It's funny   I said to myself   You can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy Kaaba  but not at the Burger King.  Quite ironic. Ironic  and it's also  I think  quite telling. Because the Kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of Islam  that of prophet Muhammad. And if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women  the rituals around the Kaaba could have been designed accordingly. But apparently that was not an issue at the time. So the rituals came that way. This is also  I think  confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the Koran  the very core of Islam    the divine core of Islam that all Muslims  and equally myself  believe. And I think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam. Because many scholars who study the history of Islamic thought    Muslim scholars or Westerners    think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in Islam  as Muslims adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the Middle East. Seclusion of women was actually a Byzantine and Persian practice  and Muslims adopted that and made that a part of their religion. And actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon. What we call today Islamic Law  and especially Islamic culture    and there are many Islamic cultures actually  the one in Saudi Arabia is much different from where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey. But still  if you're going to speak about a Muslim culture  this has a core  the divine message  which began the religion  but then many traditions  perceptions  many practices were added on top of it. And these were traditions of the Middle East    medieval traditions. And there are two important messages  or two lessons  to take from that reality. First of all  Muslims    pious  conservative  believing Muslims who want to be loyal to their religion    should not cling onto everything in their culture  thinking that that's divinely mandated. Maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed. On the other hand  the Westerners who look at Islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains. Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam. There is a practice called female circumcision. It's something terrible  horrible. It is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure. And Westerners  Europeans or Americans  who didn't know about this before faced this practice within some of the Muslim communities who migrated from North Africa. And they've thought   Oh  what a horrible religion that is which ordains something like that.  But actually when you look at female circumcision  you see that it has nothing to do with Islam  it's just a North African practice  which predates Islam. It was there for thousands of years. And quite tellingly  some Muslims do practice that. The Muslims in North Africa  not in other places. But also the non Muslim communities of North Africa    the Animists  even some Christians and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa is known to practice female circumcision. So what might look like a problem within Islamic faith might turn out to be a tradition that Muslims have subscribed to. The same thing can be said for honor killings  which is a recurrent theme in the Western media    and which is  of course  a horrible tradition. And we see truly in some Muslim communities that tradition. But in the non Muslim communities of the Middle East  such as some Christian communities  Eastern communities  you see the same practice. We had a tragic case of an honor killing within Turkey's Armenian community just a few months ago. Now these are things about general culture  but I'm also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated  or whether there's an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens. And it is no secret that many Islamic movements in the Middle East tend to be authoritarian  and some of the so called  Islamic regimes  such as Saudi Arabia  Iran and the worst case was the Taliban in Afghanistan    they are pretty authoritarian. No doubt about that. For example  in Saudi Arabia there is a phenomenon called the religious police. And the religious police imposes the supposed Islamic way of life on every citizen  by force    like women are forced to cover their heads    wear the hijab  the Islamic head cover. Now that is pretty authoritarian  and that's something I'm very much critical of. But when I realized that the non Muslim  or the non Islamic minded actors in the same geography  sometimes behaved similarly  I realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region  not just Islam. Let me give you an example  in Turkey where I come from  which is a very hyper secular republic  until very recently we used to have what I call secularism police  which would guard the universities against veiled students. In other words  they would force students to uncover their heads  and I think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it. It should be the citizen's decision. But when I saw that  I said   Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region  and some Muslims have been influenced by that. But the secular minded people can be influenced by that. Maybe it's a problem of the political culture  and we have to think about how to change that political culture.  Now these are some of the questions I had in mind a few years ago when I sat down to write a book. I said   Well I will make a research about how Islam actually came to be what it is today  and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken.  The name of the book is  Islam Without Extremes  A Muslim Case for Liberty.  And as the subtitle suggests  I looked at Islamic tradition and the history of Islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty  and I tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty. And there are strengths in Islamic tradition. Islam actually  as a monotheistic religion  which defined man as a responsible agent by itself  created the idea of the individual in the Middle East and saved it from the communitarianism  the collectivism of the tribe. You can derive many ideas from that. But besides that  I also saw problems within Islamic tradition. But one thing was curious  most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later  not from the very divine core of Islam  the Koran  but from  again  traditions and mentalities  or the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages. The Koran  for example  doesn't condone stoning. There is no punishment on apostasy. There is no punishment on personal things like drinking. These things which make Islamic Law  the troubling aspects of Islamic Law  were later developed into later interpretations of Islam. Which means that Muslims can  today  look at those things and say   Well  the core of our religion is here to stay with us. It's our faith  and we will be loyal to it. But we can change how it was interpreted  because it was interpreted according to the time and milieu in the Middle Ages. Now we are living in a different world with different values and different political systems.  That interpretation is quite possible and feasible. Now if I were the only person thinking that way  we would be in trouble. But that's not the case at all. Actually  from the   th century on  there's a whole revisionist  reformist    whatever you call it    tradition  a trend in Islamic thinking. And these were intellectuals or statesmen of the   th century  and later    th century  which looked at Europe basically and saw that Europe has many things to admire  like science and technology. But not just that  also democracy  parliament  the idea of representation  the idea of equal citizenship. These Muslim thinkers and intellectuals and statesmen of the   th century looked at Europe  saw these things. They said   Why don't we have these things   And they looked back at Islamic tradition  they saw that there are problematic aspects  but they're not the core of the religion  so maybe they can be re understood  and the Koran can be reread in the modern world. That trend is generally called Islamic modernism  and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen  not just as an intellectual idea though  but also as a political program. And that's why actually in the   th century the Ottoman Empire  which then covered the whole Middle East  made very important reforms    reforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status  accepting a constitution  accepting a representative parliament  advancing the idea of freedom of religion. And that's why the Ottoman Empire in its last decades turned into a proto democracy  a constitutional monarchy  and freedom was a very important political value at the time. Similarly  in the Arab world  there was what the great Arab historian Albert Hourani defines as the Liberal Age. He has a book   Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age   and the Liberal Age  he defines as   th century and early   th century. Quite notably  this was the dominant trend in the early   th century among Islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians. But there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the   th century  because we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line. And in place of that  what happens is that Islamism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian  which is quite strident  which is quite anti Western  and which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision. So Islamism is the problematic idea that really created a lot of problems in the   th century Islamic world. And even the very extreme forms of Islamism led to terrorism in the name of Islam    which is actually a practice that I think is against Islam  but some  obviously  extremists did not think that way. But there is a curious question  If Islamic modernism was so popular in the   th and early   th centuries  why did Islamism become so popular in the rest of the   th century  And this is a question  I think  which needs to be discussed carefully. And in my book  I went into that question as well. And actually you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that. You just look at the political history of the   th century  and you see things have changed a lot. The context has changed. In the   th century  when Muslims were looking at Europe as an example  they were independent  they were more self confident. In the early   th century  with the fall of the Ottoman Empire  the whole Middle East was colonized. And when you have colonization what do you have  You have anti colonization. So Europe is not just an example now to emulate  it's an enemy to fight and to resist. So there's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the Muslim world  and what you see is more of a defensive  rigid  reactionary strain  which led to Arab socialism  Arab nationalism and ultimately to the Islamist ideology. And when the colonial period ended  what you had in place of that was  generally  secular dictators  which say they're a country  but did not bring democracy to the country  and established their own dictatorship. And I think the West  at least some powers in the West  particularly the United States  made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators  thinking that they were more helpful for their interests. But the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed Islamic groups in their country actually made the Islamists much more strident. So in the   th century  you had this vicious cycle in the Arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people including the Islamic pious  and they're reacting in reactionary ways. There was one country  though  which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle. And that's the country where I come from  that's Turkey. Turkey has never been colonized  so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. That's one thing to remember. They did not share the same anti colonial hype that you can find in some other countries in the region. Secondly  and most importantly  Turkey became a democracy earlier than any of the countries we are talking about. In       Turkey had the first free and fair elections  which ended the more autocratic secular regime  which was the beginning of Turkey. And the pious Muslims in Turkey saw that they can change the political system by voting. And they realize that democracy is something that is compatible with Islam  compatible with their values  and they've been supportive of democracy. That's an experience that not every other Muslim nation in the Middle East had until very recently. Secondly  in the past two decades  thanks to globalization  thanks to the market economy  thanks to the rise of a middle class  we in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism. Now there's the more urban middle class pious Muslims who  again  look at their tradition and see that there are some problems in the tradition  and they understand that they need to be changed and questioned and reformed. And they look at Europe  and they see an example  again  to follow. They see an example  at least  to take some inspiration from. That's why the E.U. process  Turkey's effort to join the E.U.  has been supported inside Turkey by the Islamic pious  while some secular nations were against that. Well that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all Europeans are that welcoming    but that's another discussion. But the pro E.U. sentiment in Turkey in the past decade has become almost an Islamic cause and supported by the Islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well  of course. And thanks to that  Turkey has been able to reasonably create a success story in which Islam and the most pious understandings of Islam have become part of the democratic game  and even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country. And this has been an inspiring example right now for some of the Islamic movements or some of the countries in the Arab world. You must have all seen the Arab Spring  which began in Tunis and in Egypt. And Arab masses just revolted against their dictators. They were asking for democracy  they were asking for freedom. And they did not turn out to be the Islamist boogyman that the dictators were always using to justify their regime. They said that  we want freedom  we want democracy. We are Muslim believers  but we want to be living as free people in free societies.  Of course  this is a long road. Democracy is not an overnight achievement  it's a process. But this is a promising era in the Muslim world. And I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the   th century  but which had a setback in the   th century because of the political troubles of the Muslim world  is having a rebirth. And I think the getaway message from that would be that Islam  despite some of the skeptics in the West  has the potential in itself to create its own way to democracy  create its own way to liberalism  create its own way to freedom. They just should be allowed to work for that. Thanks so much. Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see. A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task  until now. Hello  my name is Dennis Hong  and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired. So before I talk about this car for the blind  let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge. Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself. You press start  nobody touches anything  and it can reach its destination fully autonomously. So in       our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition. So about that time  the National Federation of the Blind  or NFB  challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently. We decided to give it a try  because we thought   Hey  how hard could it be   We have already an autonomous vehicle. We just put a blind person in it and we're done  right  We couldn't have been more wrong. What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around  but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive. So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch. So to test this crazy idea  we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility. And in the summer of       we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin. It was an absolutely amazing experience. But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment  in a flat  closed off parking lot    even the lanes defined by red traffic cones. So with this success  we decided to take the next big step  to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads. So how does it work  Well  it's a rather complex system  but let me try to explain it  maybe simplify it. So we have three steps. We have perception  computation and non visual interfaces. Now obviously the driver cannot see  so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver. For that  we use an initial measurement unit. So it measures acceleration  angular acceleration    like a human ear  inner ear. We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car. We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road. And we also use three laser range finders. The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles    a car approaching from the front  the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads  any obstacles around the vehicle. So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer  and the computer can do two things. One is  first of all  process this information to have an understanding of the environment    these are the lanes of the road  there's the obstacles    and convey this information to the driver. The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car. So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle. But the problem is this  How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive  So for this  we developed many different types of non visual user interface technology. So starting from a three dimensional ping sound system  a vibrating vest  a click wheel with voice commands  a leg strip  even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot. But today we're going to talk about three of these non visual user interfaces. Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip. So these are a pair of gloves  and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer    the direction and the intensity. Another device is called SpeedStrip. So this is a chair    as a matter of fact  it's actually a massage chair. We gut it out  and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns  and we actuate them to convey information about the speed  and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal. So over here  you can see how the computer understands the environment  and because you cannot see the vibration  we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening. This is the sensory data  and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer. So these two devices  DriveGrip and SpeedStrip  are very effective. But the problem is these are instructional cue devices. So this is not really freedom  right  The computer tells you how to drive    turn left  turn right  speed up  stop. We call this the  backseat driver problem.  So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices  and we're now focusing more on the informational devices. A good example for this informational non visual user interface is called AirPix. So think of it as a monitor for the blind. So it's a small tablet  has many holes in it  and compressed air comes out  so it can actually draw images. So even though you are blind  you can put your hand over it  you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles. Actually  you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature. So it's actually a multi dimensional user interface. So here you can see the left camera  the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix. For this  we're showing a simulator  a blind person driving using the AirPix. This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non visual user interfaces. So basically that's how it works. So just a month ago  on January   th  we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex    racing event. We also had some surprises. Let's take a look. He's coming up to the grandstand  fellow Federationists. There's the grandstand now. And he's  unclear  following that van that's out in front of him. Well there comes the first box. Now let's see if Mark avoids it. He does. He passes it on the right. Third box is out. The fourth box is out. And he's perfectly making his way between the two. He's closing in on the van to make the moving pass. Well this is what it's all about  this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity. He's approaching the end of the run  makes his way between the barrels that are set up there. Dennis Hong  I'm so happy for you. Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel. Mark Riccobono  Yes. DH  So since we started this project  we've been getting hundreds of letters  emails  phone calls from people from all around the world. Letters thanking us  but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one   Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive up ATM machine.  But sometimes    But sometimes I also do get    I wouldn't call it hate mail    but letters of really strong concern   Dr. Hong  are you insane  trying to put blind people on the road  You must be out of your mind.  But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle  and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as  or safer than  today's vehicle. And I truly believe that this can happen. But still  will the society  would they accept such a radical idea  How are we going to handle insurance  How are we going to issue driver's licenses  There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality. Of course  the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind. But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin off technology that can come from this project. The sensors that are used can see through the dark  the fog and rain. And together with this new type of interfaces  we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people. Or for the blind  everyday home appliances    in the educational setting  in the office setting. Just imagine  in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non visual interfaces. This is priceless. So today  the things I've showed you today  is just the beginning. Thank you very much. I spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness    trying to see if I can actually train my mind in a particular way  like I can train my body  so I can end up with an improved feeling of overall well being. Then this January  my mother died  and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me. So in a very typical  silly designer fashion  after years worth of work  pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film. They were still done when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia. We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs. It was a little bit too funky  and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way    fashion. My studio in Bali was only    minutes away from a monkey forest  and monkeys  of course  are supposed to be the happiest of all animals. So we trained them to be able to do three separate words  to lay out them properly. You can see  there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there. The serif is not really in place. So of course  what you don't do properly yourself is never deemed done really. So this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the Sayan Valley in Indonesia. In that year  what I did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys  looking at a lot of data on this subject. And it turns out that men and women report very  very similar levels of happiness. This is a very quick overview of all the studies that I looked at. That climate plays no role. That if you live in the best climate  in San Diego in the United States  or in the shittiest climate  in Buffalo  New York  you are going to be just as happy in either place. If you make more than        bucks a year in the U.S.  any salary increase you're going to experience will have only a tiny  tiny influence on your overall well being. Black people are just as happy as white people are. If you're old or young it doesn't really make a difference. If you're ugly or if you're really  really good looking it makes no difference whatsoever. You will adapt to it and get used to it. If you have manageable health problems it doesn't really matter. Now this does matter. So now the woman on the right is actually much happier than the guy on the left    meaning that  if you have a lot of friends  and you have meaningful friendships  that does make a lot of difference. As well as being married    you are likely to be much happier than if you are single. A fellow TED speaker  Jonathan Haidt  came up with this beautiful little analogy between the conscious and the unconscious mind. He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant  the unconscious. And the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do  but the elephant really has his own ideas. If I look at my own life  I'm born in      in Austria. If I would have been born a hundred years earlier  the big decisions in my life would have been made for me    meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in  I would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did  and I would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected. I  of course  and all of us  are very much in charge of these big decisions in our lives. We live where we want to be    at least in the West. We become what we really are interested in. We choose our own profession  and we choose our own partners. And so it's quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of. If you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called George  when he decides on where he wants to live    is it Florida or North Dakota     he goes and lives in Georgia. And if you look at a guy called Dennis  when he decides what to become    is it a lawyer  or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher     best chance is that he wants to become a dentist. And if Paula decides should she marry Joe or Jack  somehow Paul sounds the most interesting. And so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons  it remains statistically true that there are more Georges living in Georgia and there are more Dennises becoming dentists and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul than statistically viable. Now I  of course  thought   Well this is American data   and I thought   Well  those silly Americans. They get influenced by things that they're not aware of. This is just completely ridiculous.  Then  of course  I looked at my mom and my dad    Karolina and Karl  and grandmom and granddad  Josefine and Josef. So I am looking still for a Stephanie. I'll figure something out. If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer  the easiest answer  of course  is do more of the stuff that I like to do and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do    for which it would be helpful to know what it is that I actually do like to do. I'm a big list maker  so I came up with a list. One of them is to think without pressure. This is a project we're working on right now with a very healthy deadline. It's a book on culture  and  as you can see  culture is rapidly drifting around. Doing things like I'm doing right now    traveling to Cannes. The example I have here is a chair that came out of the year in Bali    clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture  not being stuck behind a single computer screen all day long and be here and there. Quite consciously  design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques  just basically to fight straightforward adaptation. Being close to the content    that's the content really is close to my heart. This is a bus  or vehicle  for a charity  for an NGO that wants to double the education budget in the United States    carefully designed  so  by two inches  it still clears highway overpasses. Having end results    things that come back from the printer well  like this little business card for an animation company called Sideshow on lenticular foils. Working on projects that actually have visible impacts  like a book for a deceased German artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous. It just came out six months ago  and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany. And I think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest. And lately  to be involved in projects where I know about    percent of the project technique wise and the other    percent would be new. So in this case  it's an outside projection for Singapore on these giant Times Square like screens. And I of course knew stuff  as a designer  about typography  even though we worked with those animals not so successfully. But I didn't quite know all that much about movement or film. And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project. But also because the content was very close. In this case   Keeping a Diary Supports Personal Development     I've been keeping a diary since I was   . And I've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intriguing way. In this case also because it's part of one of the many sentiments that we build the whole series on    that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary. Thank you so much. This is a representation of your brain  and your brain can be broken into two parts. There's the left half  which is the logical side  and then the right half  which is the intuitive. And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere  then we can plot our brain. And for example  this would be somebody who's completely logical. This would be someone who's entirely intuitive. So where would you put your brain on this scale  Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes  but I think for most people in the audience  your brain is something like this    with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time. It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything. You can be logical and intuitive. And so I consider myself one of these people  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists  who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas. But at the same time  we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work. How do we develop this intuition  Well we like to play with stuff. So we go out and play with it  and then we see how it acts  and then we develop our intuition from there. And really you do the same thing. So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time. I mean  it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time  but you weren't born with this notion  you developed it. And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop. He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it  and he kept falling over. But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them  and that they stay in one place. And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world  unless you're a particle physicist. It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist  because they don't play with car stops  they play with these little weird particles. And when they play with their particles  they find they do all sorts of really weird things    like they can fly right through walls  or they can be in two different places at the same time. And so they wrote down all these observations  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics. And so that's where physics was at a few years ago  you needed quantum mechanics to describe little  tiny particles. But you didn't need it to describe the large  everyday objects around us. This didn't really sit well with my intuition  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often. Well  I play with them sometimes  but not very often. And I've never seen them. I mean  nobody's ever seen a particle. But it didn't sit well with my logical side either. Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics  I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics. So a few years ago  I set off to do just that. So I made one. This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip. And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle. And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute. This is a photograph of the object. And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center. And then here's a really  really big close up of the little piece of metal. So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal  and it's shaped like a diving board  and it's sticking out over a ledge. And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip. I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about     hours. For the last stuff  I had to build my own machine    to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device. This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition  but it needs a little help to do it. Here  let me give you an analogy. You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator  I mean  when I'm in an elevator all alone  I do all sorts of weird things  but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them  or  frankly  scare them. So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people  but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room. And so we knew  if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. And so that's what we did. We turned off the lights  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air  and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Now  all alone in the elevator  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted. And so we measured its motion. We found it was moving in really weird ways. Instead of just sitting perfectly still  it was vibrating  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this    like expanding and contracting bellows. And by giving it a gentle nudge  we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time    something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics. So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time  So let's think about the atoms. So in one case  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down. Now it's only at precise times when they align. The rest of the time they're delocalized. That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places. I think this is really cool. Really. It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because  check this out  the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you. So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time  that chunk of metal can be in two different places  then why not you  I mean  this is just my logical side talking. So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time  what would that be like  How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space  There's one more part to the story. It's when we warmed it up  and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box  we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece. And so I had to develop this new intuition  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected. Well  that's not quite right. It's more than that  it's deeper. It's that those connections  your connections to all the things around you  literally define who you are  and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. Thank you. I'm Jessi  and this is my suitcase. But before I show you what I've got inside  I'm going to make a very public confession  and that is  I'm outfit obsessed. I love finding  wearing  and more recently  photographing and blogging a different  colorful  crazy outfit for every single occasion. But I don't buy anything new. I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores. Aww  thank you. Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet. I get to meet all kinds of great people  my dollars usually go to a good cause  I look pretty unique  and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt. I mean  what am I going to find today  Is it going to be my size  Will I like the color  Will it be under      If all the answers are yes  I feel as though I've won. I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED. I mean  what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her  So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought. I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it. Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase. I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs. And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear    that means I found a few things. And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now. Does that sound good  So as I do this  I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that  believe it or not  I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new. So let's start with Sunday. I call this  Shiny Tiger.  You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great. You can almost always look phenomenal for under    . This whole outfit  including the jacket  cost me      and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week. Monday  Color is powerful. It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants. If you are happy  you are going to attract other happy people to you. Tuesday  Fitting in is way overrated. I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in. Just be who you are. If you are surrounding yourself with the right people  they will not only get it  they will appreciate it. Wednesday  Embrace your inner child. Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress up  or that I remind them of their seven year old. I like to smile and say   Thank you.  Thursday  Confidence is key. If you think you look good in something  you almost certainly do. And if you don't think you look good in something  you're also probably right. I grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out. But it wasn't until I turned    that I really got what this meant. And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second. If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out  there is no look that you can't pull off. So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience. We should be able to rock anything we want to rock. Thank you. Friday  A universal truth    five words for you  Gold sequins go with everything. And finally  Saturday  Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word. It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing  and we've had great conversations. So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase. So before I go home to Brooklyn  I'm going to donate everything back. Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go. I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner  there is always going to be another crazy  colorful  shiny outfit just waiting for me  if I put a little love in my heart and look. Thank you very much. Thank you. Power. That is the word that comes to mind. We're the new technologists. We have a lot of data  so we have a lot of power. How much power do we have  Scene from a movie   Apocalypse Now     great movie. We've got to get our hero  Captain Willard  to the mouth of the Nung River so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz. The way we're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off. So the scene  the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in. And there's this loud  thrilling music in the background  this wild music.   Dum da ta da dum     Dum da ta da dum     Da ta da da   That's a lot of power. That's the kind of power I feel in this room. That's the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have. Let's take an example. What can we do with just one person's data  What can we do with that guy's data  I can look at your financial records. I can tell if you pay your bills on time. I know if you're good to give a loan to. I can look at your medical records  I can see if your pump is still pumping    see if you're good to offer insurance to. I can look at your clicking patterns. When you come to my website  I actually know what you're going to do already because I've seen you visit millions of websites before. And I'm sorry to tell you  you're like a poker player  you have a tell. I can tell with data analysis what you're going to do before you even do it. I know what you like. I know who you are  and that's even before I look at your mail or your phone. Those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have. But I'm not actually here to talk about what we can do. I'm here to talk about what we should do. What's the right thing to do  Now I see some puzzled looks like   Why are you asking us what's the right thing to do  We're just building this stuff. Somebody else is using it.  Fair enough. But it brings me back. I think about World War II    some of our great technologists then  some of our great physicists  studying nuclear fission and fusion    just nuclear stuff. We gather together these physicists in Los Alamos to see what they'll build. We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology. So what should we be doing with that guy's data  Should we be collecting it  gathering it  so we can make his online experience better  So we can make money  So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good  Or should we respect his privacy  protect his dignity and leave him alone  Which one is it  How should we figure it out  I know  crowdsource. Let's crowdsource this. So to get people warmed up  let's start with an easy question    something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about  iPhone versus Android. Let's do a show of hands    iPhone. Uh huh. Android. You'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones. Next question  a little bit harder. Should we be collecting all of that guy's data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good  Or should we leave him alone  Collect his data. Leave him alone. You're safe. It's fine. Okay  last question    harder question    when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case  should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework  or should we use a Millian consequentialist one  Kant. Mill. Not as many votes. Yeah  that's a terrifying result. Terrifying  because we have stronger opinions about our hand held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions. How do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don't have a moral framework  We know more about mobile operating systems  but what we really need is a moral operating system. What's a moral operating system  We all know right and wrong  right  You feel good when you do something right  you feel bad when you do something wrong. Our parents teach us that  praise with the good  scold with the bad. But how do we figure out what's right and wrong  And from day to day  we have the techniques that we use. Maybe we just follow our gut. Maybe we take a vote    we crowdsource. Or maybe we punt    ask the legal department  see what they say. In other words  it's kind of random  kind of ad hoc  how we figure out what we should do. And maybe  if we want to be on surer footing  what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there  that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place  and how would we know in a given situation what to do. So let's get a moral framework. We're numbers people  living by numbers. How can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework  I know a guy who did exactly that. A brilliant guy    he's been dead       years. Plato  that's right. Remember him    old philosopher  You were sleeping during that class. And Plato  he had a lot of the same concerns that we did. He was worried about right and wrong. He wanted to know what is just. But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this. He says something's just. She says something else is just. It's kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too. I'm just going back and forth  I'm not getting anywhere. I don't want opinions  I want knowledge. I want to know the truth about justice    like we have truths in math. In math  we know the objective facts. Take a number  any number    two. Favorite number. I love that number. There are truths about two. If you've got two of something  you add two more  you get four. That's true no matter what thing you're talking about. It's an objective truth about the form of two  the abstract form. When you have two of anything    two eyes  two ears  two noses  just two protrusions    those all partake of the form of two. They all participate in the truths that two has. They all have two ness in them. And therefore  it's not a matter of opinion. What if  Plato thought  ethics was like math  What if there were a pure form of justice  What if there are truths about justice  and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated  partook of that form of justice  Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't. It wouldn't be a matter of just opinion or just appearances. That's a stunning vision. I mean  think about that. How grand. How ambitious. That's as ambitious as we are. He wants to solve ethics. He wants objective truths. If you think that way  you have a Platonist moral framework. If you don't think that way  well  you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy  because the tidy idea  you know  people criticized it. Aristotle  in particular  he was not amused. He thought it was impractical. Aristotle said   We should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows.  Aristotle thought ethics wasn't a lot like math. He thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here and now using our best judgment to find the right path. If you think that  Plato's not your guy. But don't give up. Maybe there's another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework. How about this  What if in any situation you could just calculate  look at the choices  measure out which one's better and know what to do  That sound familiar  That's a utilitarian moral framework. John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this    nice guy besides    and only been dead     years. So basis of utilitarianism    I'm sure you're familiar at least. The three people who voted for Mill before are familiar with this. But here's the way it works. What if morals  what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain  It does something intrinsic to the act. It's not like its relation to some abstract form. It's just a matter of the consequences. You just look at the consequences and see if  overall  it's for the good or for the worse. That would be simple. Then we know what to do. Let's take an example. Suppose I go up and I say   I'm going to take your phone.  Not just because it rang earlier  but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation. I thought  that guy looks suspicious. And what if he's been sending little messages to Bin Laden's hideout    or whoever took over after Bin Laden    and he's actually like a terrorist  a sleeper cell. I'm going to find that out  and when I find that out  I'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause. That has a very high utility to prevent that damage. And compared to the little pain that it's going to cause    because it's going to be embarrassing when I'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a Farmville problem and that whole bit    that's overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone. If you feel that way  that's a utilitarian choice. But maybe you don't feel that way either. Maybe you think  it's his phone. It's wrong to take his phone because he's a person and he has rights and he has dignity  and we can't just interfere with that. He has autonomy. It doesn't matter what the calculations are. There are things that are intrinsically wrong    like lying is wrong  like torturing innocent children is wrong. Kant was very good on this point  and he said it a little better than I'll say it. He said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct  and then it is our duty to follow those rules. It's not a matter of calculation. So let's stop. We're right in the thick of it  this philosophical thicket. And this goes on for thousands of years  because these are hard questions  and I've only got    minutes. So let's cut to the chase. How should we be making our decisions  Is it Plato  is it Aristotle  is it Kant  is it Mill  What should we be doing  What's the answer  What's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do  whether we should use that guy's data or not  What's the formula  There's not a formula. There's not a simple answer. Ethics is hard. Ethics requires thinking. And that's uncomfortable. I know  I spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence  trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us  that could give us answers. But they can't. You can't just take human thinking and put it into a machine. We're the ones who have to do it. Happily  we're not machines  and we can do it. Not only can we think  we must. Hannah Arendt said   The sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil. It arises from not thinking.  That's what she called the  banality of evil.  And the response to that is that we demand the exercise of thinking from every sane person. So let's do that. Let's think. In fact  let's start right now. Every person in this room do this  think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing  where you wondered   What should I be doing   Bring that to mind  and now reflect on that and say   How did I come up that decision  What did I do  Did I follow my gut  Did I have somebody vote on it  Or did I punt to legal   Or now we have a few more choices.  Did I evaluate what would be the highest pleasure like Mill would  Or like Kant  did I use reason to figure out what was intrinsically right   Think about it. Really bring it to mind. This is important. It is so important we are going to spend    seconds of valuable TEDTalk time doing nothing but thinking about this. Are you ready  Go. Stop. Good work. What you just did  that's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power. Now the next step    try this. Go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision. Not right now. Wait till I finish talking. Do it over lunch. And don't just find another technologist friend  find somebody different than you. Find an artist or a writer    or  heaven forbid  find a philosopher and talk to them. In fact  find somebody from the humanities. Why  Because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists. Just a few days ago  right across the street from here  there was hundreds of people gathered together. It was technologists and humanists at that big BiblioTech Conference. And they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective. You have someone from Google talking to someone who does comparative literature. You're thinking about the relevance of   th century French theater    how does that bear upon venture capital  Well that's interesting. That's a different way of thinking. And when you think in that way  you become more sensitive to the human considerations  which are crucial to making ethical decisions. So imagine that right now you went and you found your musician friend. And you're telling him what we're talking about  about our whole data revolution and all this    maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music.   Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum   Well  your musician friend will stop you and say   You know  the theme music for your data revolution  that's an opera  that's Wagner. It's based on Norse legend. It's Gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry.  That's interesting. Now it's also a beautiful opera  and we're moved by that opera. We're moved because it's about the battle between good and evil  about right and wrong. And we care about right and wrong. We care what happens in that opera. We care what happens in  Apocalypse Now.  And we certainly care what happens with our technologies. We have so much power today  it is up to us to figure out what to do  and that's the good news. We're the ones writing this opera. This is our movie. We figure out what will happen with this technology. We determine how this will all end. Thank you. When I was growing up in Montana  I had two dreams. I wanted to be a paleontologist  a dinosaur paleontologist  and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur. And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life. I was very fortunate early in my career. I was fortunate in finding things. I wasn't very good at reading things. In fact  I don't read much of anything. I am extremely dyslexic  and so reading is the hardest thing I do. But instead  I go out and I find things. Then I just pick things up. I basically practice for finding money on the street. And I wander about the hills  and I have found a few things. And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests  the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones. And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big  stupid  green reptiles that people had thought for so many years. People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special. And so  at that time  I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues. We were able to actually say that dinosaurs    based on the evidence we had    that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young  brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds. So it was pretty interesting stuff. I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social. We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults. The appearance of them would have been different    which it is in all social animals. In social groups of animals  the juveniles always look different than the adults. The adults can recognize the juveniles  the juveniles can recognize the adults. And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like. And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around. But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton. And in his book  he talked about the social animals. And then Steven Spielberg  of course  depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures. The theme of this story is building a dinosaur  and so we come to that part of  Jurassic Park.  Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life. You all know the story  right. I mean  I assume everyone here has seen  Jurassic Park.  If you want to make a dinosaur  you go out  you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap    otherwise known as amber    that has some blood sucking insects in it  good ones  and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA  because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out. And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it. And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg  or something like that  and then you wait  and  lo and behold  out pops a little baby dinosaur. And everybody's happy about that. And they're happy over and over again. They keep doing it  they just keep making these things. And then  then  then  and then ... Then the dinosaurs  being social  act out their socialness  and they get together  and they conspire. And  of course  that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie    conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around. So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it  and you drilled into it  and you got something out of that insect  and you cloned it  and you did it over and over and over again  you'd have a room full of mosquitos. And probably a whole bunch of trees as well. Now if you want dinosaur DNA  I say go to the dinosaur. So that's what we've done. Back in      when the movie came out  we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur  and we chose the dinosaur on the left  a Tyrannosaurus rex  which was a very nice specimen. And one of my former doctoral students  Dr. Mary Schweitzer  actually had the background to do this sort of thing. And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex  one of the thigh bones  and she actually found some very interesting structures in there. They found these red circular looking objects  and they looked  for all the world  like red blood cells. And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone. And so she thought  well  what the heck. So she sampled some material out of it. Now it wasn't DNA  she didn't find DNA. But she did find heme  which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin. And that was really cool. That was interesting. That was    here we have    million year old heme. Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it. So a few years went by  and then we started the Hell Creek Project. And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find  and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them. And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space  a lot of badlands  and not very many people  and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff. And we did find a lot of stuff. We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs  but we found one special Tyrannosaur  and we called it B rex. And B rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock. It wasn't a very complete T. rex  and it wasn't a very big T. rex  but it was a very special B rex. And I and my colleagues cut into it  and we were able to determine  by looking at lines of arrested growth  some lines in it  that B rex had died at the age of   . We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived  because we haven't found the oldest one yet. But this one died at the age of   . We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer  and she was actually able to determine that B rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone. Medullary tissue is the calcium build up  the calcium storage basically  when an animal is pregnant  when a bird is pregnant. So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs. But Mary went further. She took the bone  and she dumped it into acid. Now we all know that bones are fossilized  and so if you dump it into acid  there shouldn't be anything left. But there was something left. There were blood vessels left. There were flexible  clear blood vessels. And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur. It was extraordinary. But she also found osteocytes  which are the cells that laid down the bones. And try and try  we could not find DNA  but she did find evidence of proteins. But we thought maybe    well  we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground. We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast. And so we built a laboratory in the back of an    wheeler trailer  and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples. And we did. We got better material. The cells looked better. The vessels looked better. Found the protein collagen. I mean  it was wonderful stuff. But it's not dinosaur DNA. So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA  and all DNA  just breaks down too fast. We're just not going to be able to do what they did in  Jurassic Park.  We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur. But birds are dinosaurs. Birds are living dinosaurs. We actually classify them as dinosaurs. We now call them non avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs. So the non avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct. Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds. So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them. I know  you're as bad as the sixth graders. The sixth graders look at it and they say   No.   You can call it a dinosaur  but look at the velociraptor  the velociraptor is cool.   The chicken is not.  So this is our problem  as you can imagine. The chicken is a dinosaur. I mean it really is. You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way. But the sixth graders demand it.  Fix the chicken.  So that's what I'm here to tell you about  how we are going to fix a chicken. So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken. Because evolution works  we actually have some evolutionary tools. We'll call them biological modification tools. We have selection. And we know selection works. We started out with a wolf like creature and we ended up with a Maltese. I mean  that's    that's definitely genetic modification. Or any of the other funny looking little dogs. We also have transgenesis. Transgenesis is really cool too. That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one. That's how people make GloFish. You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish  and  puff  they glow. And that's pretty cool. And they obviously make a lot of money off of them. And now they're making Glow rabbits and Glow all sorts of things. I guess we could make a glow chicken. But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth graders either. But there's another thing. There's what we call atavism activation. And atavism activation is basically    an atavism is an ancestral characteristic. You heard that occasionally children are born with tails  and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic. And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen. Snakes are occasionally born with legs. And here's an example. This is a chicken with teeth. A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth  and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens. Now that's a good characteristic. We can save that one. We know we can use that. We can make a chicken with teeth. That's getting closer. That's better than a glowing chicken. A friend of mine  a colleague of mine  Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University  is actually looking at atavisms. And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop  and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail. He's also interested in the transformation of the arm  the hand  to the wing. He's looking for those genes as well. And I said   Well  if you can find those  I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders.  And so he agreed. And so that's what we're looking into. If you look at dinosaur hands  a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it. Archaeopteryx  which is a bird  a primitive bird  still has that very primitive hand. But as you can see  the pigeon  or a chicken or anything else  another bird  has kind of a weird looking hand  because the hand is a wing. But the cool thing is that  if you look in the embryo  as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand. It has the three fingers  the three digits. But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together. And so what we're looking for is that gene. We want to stop that gene from turning on  fusing those hands together  so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three fingered hand  like the archaeopteryx. And the same goes for the tails. Birds have basically rudimentary tails. And so we know that in embryo  as the animal is developing  it actually has a relatively long tail. But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail  gets rid of it. So that's the other gene we're looking for. We want to stop that tail from resorbing. So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken  modify it and make the chickenosaurus. It's a cooler looking chicken. But it's just the very basics. So that really is what we're doing. And people always say   Why do that  Why make this thing  What good is it   Well  that's a good question. Actually  I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things. And quite frankly  I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it  he could actually advertise an extra piece. Anyway    When our dino chicken hatches  it will be  obviously  the poster child  or what you might call a poster chick  for technology  entertainment and design. Thank you. This story is about taking imagination seriously. Fourteen years ago  I first encountered this ordinary material  fishnet  used the same way for centuries. Today  I'm using it to create permanent  billowing  voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world. I was an unlikely person to be doing this. I never studied sculpture  engineering or architecture. In fact  after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven. I went off on my own to become an artist  and I painted for    years  when I was offered a Fulbright to India. Promising to give exhibitions of paintings  I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram. The deadline for the show arrived    my paints didn't. I had to do something. This fishing village was famous for sculpture. So I tried bronze casting. But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive. I went for a walk on the beach  watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand. I'd seen it every day  but this time I saw it differently    a new approach to sculpture  a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials. My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen. It's a self portrait titled  Wide Hips.  We hoisted them on poles to photograph. I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns. I was mesmerized. I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans  next in Lithuania with lace makers. I liked the fine detail it gave my work  but I wanted to make them larger    to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in. Returning to India to work with those fishermen  we made a net of a million and a half hand tied knots    installed briefly in Madrid. Thousands of people saw it  and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto  Portugal. He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city. I didn't know if I could do that and preserve my art. Durable  engineered  permanent    those are in opposition to idiosyncratic  delicate and ephemeral. For two years  I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays  salt  air  pollution  and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind. We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle. So we raised this        pound steel ring. We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds. But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving. I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel. He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement. I couldn't build this the way I knew because hand tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane. So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory  learned the variables of their machines  and figured out a way to make lace with them. There was no language to translate this ancient  idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce. So we had to create one. Three years and two children later  we raised this        square foot lace net. It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built  permanent and had lost nothing in translation. This intersection had been bland and anonymous. Now it had a sense of place. I walked underneath it for the first time. As I watched the wind's choreography unfold  I felt sheltered and  at the same time  connected to limitless sky. My life was not going to be the same. I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world. I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work. Historic Philadelphia City Hall  its plaza  I felt  needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting. So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing  discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet. I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time    like an X ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding. Next challenge  the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked  could I represent the    nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture  I didn't know where to begin  but I said yes. I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean. It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates  sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day. So I contacted NOAA  and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami  and translated it into this. Its title    .    refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth's day was shortened. I couldn't build this with a steel ring  the way I knew. Its shape was too complex now. So I replaced the metal armature with a soft  fine mesh of a fiber    times stronger than steel. The sculpture could now be entirely soft  which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings    literally becoming part of the fabric of the city. There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity. So we had to create it. Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line. This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers. They don't have funding yet  but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed. Fourteen years ago  I searched for beauty in the traditional things  in craft forms. Now I combine them with hi tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous  billowing forms the scale of buildings. My artistic horizons continue to grow. I'll leave you with this story. I got a call from a friend in Phoenix. An attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art  never visited the local art museum  dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture. There they were in their business suits  laying in the grass  noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know  sharing the rediscovery of wonder. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In       I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development. Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work  they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents. Now we're a long way away from that goal right now. There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them. But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them. So we could easily supply the world with dozens  maybe hundreds  of new cities. Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities. But just substitute apartment building for cities. Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them  the other half aren't there yet. You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments. But you know what you'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction. So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions. But you could go out someplace brand new  build a brand new apartment building  as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way. So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name  charter cities. Later I learned that at about this same time  Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras. They knew that about        Hondurans every year would leave to go to the United States  and they wanted to ask  what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Honduras. At one point  Javier said to Octavio   What if we took some of our empty land    what if we just gave it to an embassy    give some to the U.S. embassy  give some to the Canadian embassy    and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States  they can go get jobs  do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do   In the summer of       Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis. At the next regularly scheduled election  Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform  but reconciliation as well. He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff. Meanwhile  I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal. Through a process of refinement  trial and error  a lot of user testing  I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials. The first point was the importance of rules  like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders. We pay a lot of attention to new technologies  but it takes technologies and rules to get progress  and it's usually the rules that hold us back. In the fall of       a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk. He showed it to Javier. They called me. They said   Let's present this to the leaders of our country.  So in December we met in Miami  in a hotel conference room. I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are  how much more valuable they are than they cost. And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City  notice  land that's worth thousands of dollars  in some cases  per square meter. But it was a fairly abstract discussion  and at some point when there was a pause  Octavio said   Paul  maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.  So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms  a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in  to go live under those rules or not. So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project  this is important  this could be the way forward for our country. I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth. So I presented another fact filled lecture that included a slide like this  which tried to make the point that  if you want to create a lot of value in a city  it has to be very big. This is a picture of Denver  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver. This airport alone covers more than     square kilometers. So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans  if you build a new city  you've got to start with a site that's at least       square kilometers. That's more than     hundred thousand acres. Everybody applauded politely. The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive. The leader of the congress came up on stage and said   Professor Romer  thank you very much for your lecture  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk. I've got it here on my laptop.  So I sat down  and they played the TEDTalk. And it got to the essence  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people. There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North. And it also involved new choices for leaders. Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries  who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement  so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced. And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust. We went and looked at a site. This picture's from there. It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers. And shortly thereafter  on January   th  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions. In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was     to one. All parties  all factions in society  backed this. To be part of the constitution  you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. On February   th they passed it again with another vote of     to one. Immediately after that vote  on February   st to the   th  a delegation of about    Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business. One is South Korea. This is a picture of a big  new city center that's being built in South Korea    bigger than downtown Boston. Everything you see there was built in four years  after they spent four years getting the permits. The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore. They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third. So if you think about this practically  here's where we are. They've got a site  they're already thinking about this site for the second city. They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in  and also an external legal system. One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there. There's designers and builders of cities who are very interested. They even can bring with them some financing. But the one thing you know they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants. There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas  especially in a place with a free trade zone  and there's lots of people who'd like to go there. Around the world  there's     million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now. There's a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States. Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job    sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing. Sadly  sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen  in some cases  for a decade. So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras  Or to build a dozen of these  or a hundred of these  around the world  What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents  This is an idea worth spreading. And my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you  TED. I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of      on the exact same day  at the exact same moment  each conceiving a baby    okay  So two couples each conceiving one baby. Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception  you're not going to listen to me. So just imagine that for a moment. And in this scenario  I want to imagine that  in one case  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome  meeting that X chromosome of the egg. And in the other case  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome  meeting the X chromosome of the egg. Both are viable  both take off. We'll come back to these people later. So I wear two hats in most of what I do. As the one hat  I do history of anatomy. I'm a historian by training  and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy    meaning human bodies  animal bodies    how they dealt with bodily fluids  concepts of bodies  how have they thought about bodies. The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist  as a patient advocate    or  as I sometimes say  as an impatient advocate    for people who are patients of doctors. In that case  what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms. So some of what I've worked on  for example  is people who are conjoined twins    two people within one body. Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism    so people who are much shorter than typical. And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex    so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types. And as a general term  we can use the term intersex for this. Intersex comes in a lot of different forms. I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female. So in one instance  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto gonads  which we all have in the fetal life  to become testes. And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone. But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone  the body doesn't react to the testosterone. And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome. So lots of levels of testosterone  but no reaction to it. As a consequence  the body develops more along the female typical path. When the child is born  she looks like a girl. She is a girl. She is raised as a girl. And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts  but she's not getting her period  that somebody figures out something's up here. And they do some tests and figure out that  instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus  she actually has testes inside  and she has a Y chromosome. Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male  but they're really not. Females  like males  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands. They're in the back of our body. And the adrenal glands make androgens  which are a masculinizing hormone. Most females like me    I believe myself to be a typical female    I don't actually know my chromosomal make up but I think I'm probably typical    most females like me are actually androgen sensitive. We're making androgen  and we're responding to androgens. The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome. So sex is really complicated  it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum    in some ways  they can be all over the place. Another example  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was    years old  who was born a boy  raised a boy  had a girlfriend  had sex with his girlfriend  had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside. What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. He had XX chromosomes  and in the womb  his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created  essentially  a masculine hormonal environment. And as a consequence  his genitals were masculinzed  his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones. And he was born looking like a boy    nobody suspected anything. And it was only when he had reached the age of    that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally  that doctors figured out that  in fact  he was female internally. Okay  so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex. Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis  which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. And we're not exactly sure why that happens. So sex can come in lots of different varieties. The reason that children with these kinds of bodies    whether it's dwarfism  or it's conjoined twinning  or it's an intersex type    are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health. In many cases  people are actually perfectly healthy. The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories. Or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity. So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity  what it means to be a black person is  allegedly  is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history. And so we have this terribly simplistic idea. And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different  it startles us in terms of those categorizations. So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism. And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism. Well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body. Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner  Caster Semenya  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin. I had a lot of journalists calling me  asking me   Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female   And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test. In fact  we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female  or between male and intersex and female and intersex  we actually draw that line on nature. So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes  the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. And it's not just in terms of sex. It's also in terms of race  which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed. As we look  we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas. We look  for example  about the fact that we share at least    percent of our DNA with chimpanzees. What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides  And as we get farther and farther with our science  we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic. So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life. One of the places we're seeing it  for example  in our culture today  in the United States today  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life. We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human  such that it has a different right than a fetal life. We have very difficult conversations nowadays    probably not out in the open as much as within medicine    about the question of when somebody's dead. In the past  our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead. At most  they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose  and if it twitched  they didn't bury them yet. If it stopped twitching  you bury them. But today  we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings. And as a consequence  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead  and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before. Now you might think that all this breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy. I'm a political progressive  I defend people with unusual bodies  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous. Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense. And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy. So in order to tell you about that tension  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers. I know they were racists  I know they were sexist  but they were great. I mean  they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical        every few years  and it's not because of the music  which is totally forgettable. It's because of what happened in      with the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers were  for my point of view  the original anatomical activists  and this is why. What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for     years. So as you all recall  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy  and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy. The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA  but they did have a concept of birthright. They had a concept of blue blood. They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth. The Founding Fathers rejected that idea  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept  and that concept was all men are created equal. They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy  not the difference in anatomy  and that was a really radical thing to do. Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together. And that was democracy growing up  but it was also science growing up at the same time. And it's really clear  if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers  a lot of them were very interested in science  and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world. They were moving away from supernatural explanations  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power  where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright. They were moving towards a naturalistic concept. And if you look  for example  in the Declaration of Independence  they talk about nature and nature's God. They don't talk about God and God's nature. They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are. So as part of that  they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality. And in doing so  they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future. They didn't think of it that way  but they did it for us  and it was great. So what happened years afterward  What happened was women  for example  who wanted the right to vote  took the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said   The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote  the right to full citizenship  the right to own property  etc.  etc.  And women successfully argued that. Next came the successful Civil Rights movement  where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about   Ain't I a woman   We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying   I am a man.  Again  people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy  again  successfully. We see the same thing with the disability rights movement. The problem is  of course  that  as we begin to look at all that commonality  we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions. Now mind you  I want to maintain some divisions  anatomically  in our culture. For example  I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human. I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy. I don't want to say five year olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry. So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain. But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning. So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk. We have two beings  both conceived in the middle of      on the exact same day. Let's imagine one of them  Mary  is born three months prematurely  so she's born on June        . Henry  by contrast  is born at term  so he's born on March        . Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months  she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does    the right to consent to sex  the right to vote  the right to drink. Henry has to wait for all of that  not because he's actually any different in age  biologically  except in terms of when he was born. We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are. Henry  by virtue of being assumed to be male    although I haven't told you that he's the XY one    by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted  which Mary does not need to worry about. Mary  meanwhile  cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states  namely  the right to marry. Henry can marry in every state a woman  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman. So we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable. And the question to me becomes  What do we do  as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy  that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart  I don't want to give up the science  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us. So where do we go  It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude   Well  we have to draw the line somewhere  so we will draw the line somewhere.  But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position. So for example  Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome. Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes. But this is also very bizarre  because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome. If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy  Dr. Martin Luther King  he offers us something of a solution in his  I have a dream  speech. He says we should judge people  based not on the color of their skin  but on the content of their character   moving beyond anatomy. And I want to say   Yeah  that sounds like a really good idea.  But in practice  how do you do it  How do you judge people based on the content of character  I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans  because  I have to admit  that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know. I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed  intelligent  mature decisions about sexual relations than some    year olds that I know. So how do we operationalize the question of content of character  It turns out to be really difficult. And part of me also wonders  what if content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future    able to be seen with an fMRI  Do we really want to go there  I'm not sure where we go. What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy. We've done a really good job struggling with democracy  and I think we would do a good job in the future. We don't have a situation that Iran has  for example  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change  in which case he's allowed to live. We don't have that kind of situation. I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with    a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them  partly to make a name for himself. But when I was on the phone with him  asking why he was going to do this surgery    this was a very high risk surgery    his answer was that  in this other nation  these children were going to be treated very badly  and so he had to do this. My response to him was   Well  have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery   The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state. So I think we have to be in the lead. Well  just to close  I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the fathers. And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like  or might have looked like  if we had more involved the mothers. And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist  and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies  particularly when we have people thinking in groups. Now for years  because I've been interested in intersex  I've also been interested in sex difference research. And one of the things that I've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world. And what we know from cross cultural studies is that females  on average    not everyone  but on average    are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group. And so if we think about that  we have an interesting situation on our hands. Years ago  when I was in graduate school  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism    I considered myself a feminist  as I still do    asked a really strange question. He said   Tell me what's feminine about feminism.  And I thought   Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender  so there's nothing feminine about feminism.  But the more I thought about his question  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism. That is to say  there might be something  on average  different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable. So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state  it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept  what we would have is more of a concept of  not just how to protect  but how to care for each other. And maybe that's where we need to go in the future  when we take democracy beyond anatomy  is to think less about the individual body  in terms of the identity  and think more about those relationships. So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union  we're thinking about what we do for each other. Thank you. From all outward appearances  John had everything going for him. He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six figure profit  and he'd only owned it for five years. The school where he graduated from with his master's had just offered him a teaching appointment  which meant not only a salary  but benefits for the first time in ages. And yet  despite everything going really well for John  he was struggling  fighting addiction and a gripping depression. On the night of June   th        he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below. Remarkably    no  miraculously    he lived. The fall shattered his right arm  broke every rib that he had  punctured his lung  and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River  under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry  where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain  contacted the boat's captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital. And that's actually where our story begins. Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together    first physically  then emotionally  and then spiritually    he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did. Research shows that    out of    people who attempt suicide will fail. But the people who fail are    times more likely to succeed the second time. This truly is an at risk population with very few resources to support them. And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life  because of our taboos around suicide  we're not sure what to say  and so quite often we say nothing. And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in. I know John's story very well because I'm John. And this is  today  the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on. But after having lost a beloved teacher in      and a good friend last year to suicide  and sitting last year at TEDActive  I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading    and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help. As the Trevor Project says  it gets better. It gets way better. And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you  to urge you  that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide  or you know somebody who has  talk about it  get help. It's a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. Thank you. A couple of years ago when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach  I met Harriet. We'd actually met online before    not the way you're thinking. We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey  one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies. And because we shared our genetic information with Linda  she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA    Haplotype K a b a    which meant that we were distantly related. We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman. So Ozzie  Harriet and me. And being the current day  of course  we started our own Facebook group. You're all welcome to join. And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference  she'd gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T shirts. Now why am I telling you this story  and what does this have to do with the future of health  Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross disciplinary  exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness    from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking. What I'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies. We often think linearly. But if you think about it  if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day    two  four  eight        in    days you have       . What do you think you have in a month  We're at a billion. So if we start to think exponentially  we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us. And many of these technologies    speaking as a physician and innovator    we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care  and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today  ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population  the way we really don't use information very well today  the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation. And one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left. We spend most of our money on the last    percent of life. What if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health  leveraging technology as well  Now my favorite technology  example of exponential technology  we all have in our pocket. So if you think about it  these are really dramatically improving. I mean this is the iPhone  . Imagine what the iPhone   will be able to do. Now  I've gained some insight into this. I've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University based in Silicon Valley. And we bring together every summer about     very talented students from around the world. And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine  biotech  artificial intelligence  robotics  nanotechnology  space  and address how can we cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals. We also have seven day executive programs. And coming up next month is actually Future Med  a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine. Now I mentioned the phone. These mobile phones have over        different mobile apps available    to the point where there's one out of the U.K. where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD. I don't know if I'd try that yet  but that's available. There are all other sorts of applications  merging your phone and diagnostics  for example    measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that  potentially  to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic. So let's see now how exponential technologies are taking health care. Let's start with faster. Well it's no secret that computers  through Moore's law  are speeding up faster and faster. We have the ability to do more powerful things with them. They're really approaching  in many cases surpassing  the ability of the human mind. But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging. The ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible. And we're layering multiple technologies    PET scans  CT scans and molecular diagnostics    to find and to seek things at different levels. Here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today  reconstructed of Marc Hodosh  the curator of TEDMED. And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available  and essentially learn how to reconstruct  and maybe even re engineer  or backwards engineer  the brain so we can better understand pathology  disease and therapy. We can look inside with real time fMRI    in the brain at real time. And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections  we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective  for example  psychoactive drugs. The scanners for these are getting small  less expensive and more portable. And this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge. The scan of today takes up about     books  or    gigabytes. The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte  or         books. How do you leverage that information  Let's get personal. I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy  but if you're over age     it's time for your screening colonoscopy. How would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick  Well now there's essentially a virtual colonoscopy. Compare those two pictures  and now as a radiologist  you can essentially fly through your patient's colon and  augmenting that with artificial intelligence  identify potentially  as you see here  a lesion. Oh  we might have missed it  but using A.I. on top of radiology  we can find lesions that were missed before. And maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise. And this is an example of this paradigm shift. We're moving to this integration of biomedicine  information technology  wireless and  I would say  mobile now    this era of digital medicine. So even my stethoscope is now digital. And of course  there's an app for that. We're moving  obviously  to the era of the tricorder. So the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope. These are now at a price point of    what used to be         euros or a couple of hundred thousand dollars    for about       dollars  I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand. And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records    in the United States  we're still less than    percent electronic. Here in the Netherlands  I think it's more than    percent. But now that we're switching to merging medical data  making it available electronically  we can crowd source that information  and now as a physician  I can access my patients' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device. And now  of course  we're in the era of the iPad  even the iPad  . And just last month the first FDA approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices. So certainly  the physicians of today  including myself  are completely reliable on these devices. And as you saw just about a month ago  Watson from IBM beat the two champions in  Jeopardy.  So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years  when we've started to apply this cloud based information  when we really have the A.I. physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done. Already today  you don't need to go to your physician in many cases. Only for about    percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient. We're now in the era of virtual visits    from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American Well  to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system. The ability to interact with your health care provider is different. And these are being augmented even by our devices again today. Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room    I can do some diagnostics that way. Or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology  like the Microsoft Kinect  and hack that to enable diagnostics  for example  in diagnosing stroke  using simple motion detection  using hundred dollar devices. We can actually now visit our patients robotically    this is the RP   if I'm a hematologist  visit another clinic  visit a hospital. These will be augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now. So imagine we already have wireless scales. You can step on the scale. You can Tweet your weight to your friends  and they can keep you in line. We have wireless blood pressure cuffs. A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together. So instead of wearing these kludgy devices  we can put on a simple patch. This was developed by colleagues at Stanford  called the iRhythm    completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity. Now we're also in the era  today  of quantified self. Consumers now can buy basically hundred dollar devices  like this little FitBit. I can measure my steps  my caloric outtake. I can get insight into that on a daily basis. I can share that with my friends  with my physician. There's watches coming out that will measure your heart rate  the Zeo sleep monitors  a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health. And as we start to integrate this information  we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies  health and wellness. There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate. And I would argue  in the future  we'll have wearable devices in our clothes  monitoring ourselves     . And just like we have the OnStar system in cars  your red light might go on    it won't say  check engine  though. It's going to be  check your body  light  and go in and get it taken care of. Probably in a few years  you'll check into your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you. For those of you with kiddos at home  how would you like to have the wireless diaper that supports your ... too much information  I think  than you might need. But it's going to be here. Now we've heard a lot today about new technology and connection. And I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients  and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine  as augmented by these sorts of technologies. Now we've talked about augmenting the patient  to some degree. How about augmenting the physician  We're now in the era of super enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery  which is here today  at a level that was not really possible even five years ago. Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality. So the surgeon can see inside the patient  through their lens  where the tumor is  where the blood vessels are. This can be integrated with decisions support. A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam  for example. And we're entering an era of really  truly scarless surgery called NOTES  where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically. And this is called NOTES  and this is coming    basically scarless surgery  as mediated by robotic surgery. Now how about controlling other elements  For those who have disabilities    the paraplegic    there's the era of brain computer interface  or BCI  where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or  eventually  a robotic arm. And these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients. Still in clinical trials  but imagine when we can connect these  for example  to the amazing bionic limb  such as the DEKA Arm built by Dean Kamen and colleagues  which has    degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past. So we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually. If you haven't lost a limb    you've had a stroke  for example    you can wear these augmented limbs. Or if you're a paraplegic    like I've visited the folks at Berkley Bionics    they've developed eLEGS. I took this video last week. Here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons. He's otherwise completely wheelchair bound. And now this is the early era of wearable robotics. And I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies  we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability  or super enabling. This is Aimee Mullins  who lost her lower limbs as a young child  and Hugh Herr  who's a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident. And now both of these can climb better  move faster  swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons. Now how about other exponentials  Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction  including with huge costs. But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller. So a few examples  we're now in the era of  Fantastic Voyage   the iPill. You can swallow this completely integrated device. It can take pictures of your GI system  help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract. We get into even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in a much less invasive manner. Sometimes these might self assemble in your GI system and be augmented in that reality. On the cardiac side  pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them. And they're going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely. These are shrinking even further. Here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny. Artificial retinas  the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see. Again  in early trials  but moving into the future. These are going to be game changing. Or for those of us who are sighted  how about having the assisted living contact lens  BlueTooth  WiFi available    beams back images to your eye. Now if you have trouble maintaining your diet  it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you. How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics  In fact  the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing. We can now leverage microfluidics  like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford. Microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians. Put it on a chip  enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care  anywhere in the world. And this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under served and enable what used to be thousand dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care. If we go down the small pathway a little bit farther  we're entering the era of nanomedicine  the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system  or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries. Now how about exponentially cheaper  Not something we usually think about in the era of medicine  but hard disks used to be       dollars for    megabytes    exponentially cheaper. In genomics now  the genome cost about a billion dollars about    years ago when the first one came out. We're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome    probably next year to two years  probably a hundred dollar genome. What are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes  And soon we'll have millions of these tests available. And that's when it gets interesting  when we start to crowdsource that information. And we enter the era of true personalized medicine    the right drug for the right person at the right time    instead of what we're doing today  which is the same drug for everybody    sort of blockbuster drug medications  medications which don't work for you  the individual. And many  many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches. And I'll also show you a simple example  from   andMe again. My data indicates that I've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration  a kind of blindness. But if I take that same data  upload it to deCODEme  I can look at my risk for sample type   diabetes. I'm at almost twice the risk for type   diabetes. I might want to watch how much dessert I have at the lunch break for example. It might change my behavior. Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics    how my genes modulate  what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important  and once in the hands of the individual and the patient  will make better drug dosing and selection available. So again  it's not just genes  it's multiple details    our habits  our environmental exposure. When was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived  Geomedicine  where you've lived  what you've been exposed to  can dramatically affect your health. We can capture that information. So genomics  proteomics  the environment  all this data streaming at us individually and us  as poor physicians  how do we manage it  Well we're now entering the era of systems medicine  or systems biology  where we can start to integrate all of this information. And by looking at the patterns  for example  in our blood of        biomarkers in a single test  we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage. This has been called by Lee Hood  the father of the field  P  medicine. We're going to be predictive  we're going to know what you're likely to have. We can be preventative  that prevention can be personalized  and more importantly  it's going to become increasingly participatory. Through websites like Patients Like Me or managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health  leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important. So I'll finish up with exponentially better. We'd like to get therapies better and more effective. Now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills. What if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension  This is a new device that is essentially doing that. It should be on the market within a year or two. How about more targeted therapies for cancer  Right  I'm an oncologist and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison. We've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells  the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse. So if you think of cancer as a weed  we often can whack the weed away. It seems to shrink  but it often comes back. So we're attacking the wrong target. The cancer stem cells remain  and the tumor can return months or years later. We're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure. And we're entering the era of personalized oncology  the ability to leverage all of this data together  analyze the tumor and come up with a real  specific cocktail for the individual patient. Now I'll close with regenerative medicine. So I've studied a lot about stem cells    embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful. We also have adult stem cells throughout our body. We use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation. Geron  just last year  started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries. Still a Phase I trial  but evolving. We've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about    years to approach a whole range of topics  particularly in cardiovascular disease. We take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack  we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack. I invented a device called the MarrowMiner  a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow. It's now been FDA approved  and it'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so. Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient's body and removing the patient's bone marrow  instead of with     punctures  with just a single puncture under local anesthesia. But where is stem cell therapy really going  If you think about it  every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo. We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient    making your own personalized stem cell lines. And I think they'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells  myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future  should you need them. And we're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering  and integrating exponential technologies for essentially  D organ printing    replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a  D organ. That's where things are going to head    still very early days. But I think  as integration of exponential technologies  this is the example. So in close  as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine  we're entering an era of miniaturization  decentralization and personalization. And I think by pulling these things together  if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these  we're going to empower the patient  enable the doctor  enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick. Because I know as a doctor  if someone comes to me with Stage I disease  I'm thrilled    we can often cure them. But often it's too late and it's Stage III or IV cancer  for example. So by leveraging these technologies together  I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call Stage   medicine. And as a cancer doctor  I'm looking forward to being out of a job. Thanks very much. Host  Thank you. Thank you. Take a bow. Take a bow. I'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background. I was in my   s before I ever went to an art museum. I grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural Arkansas  an hour from the nearest movie theater. And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist because I grew up around quirky  colorful characters who were great at making with their hands. And my childhood is more hick than I could ever possibly relate to you  and also more intellectual than you would ever expect. For instance  me and my sister  when we were little  we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains. But on the other side of that  though  we were big readers in our house. And if the TV was on  we were watching a documentary. And my dad is the most voracious reader I know. He can read a novel or two a day. But when I was little  I remember  he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun. And what was so amazing to me about that    well he would be in his recliner  would holler for me to fetch the BB gun  and I'd go get it. And what was amazing to me    well it was pretty kickass  he was killing a fly in the house with a gun    but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it. And he could shoot it from two rooms away and not damage what it was on because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly and not damage what it landed on. So I should talk about art. Or we'll be here all day with my childhood stories. I love contemporary art  but I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene. A few years ago  I spent months in Europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world. And I was struck by going to so many  one after the other  with some clarity of what it was that I was longing for. And I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting  or not getting enough of. But two of the main things  one of it  I was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public  that was accessible. And the second thing that I was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship and technique. So I started thinking and listing what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial. So I decided  I'm going to start my own biennial. I'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world. So I thought  okay  I have to have some criteria of how to choose work. So amongst all the criteria I have  there's two main things. One of them  I call my Mimaw's Test. And what that is is I imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes  and if I can't explain it in five minutes  then it's too obtuse or esoteric and it hasn't been refined enough yet. It needs to worked on until it can speak fluently. And then my other second set of rules    I hate to say  rules  because it's art    my criteria would be the three H's  which is head  heart and hands. And great art would have  head   it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts. It would have  heart  in that it would have passion and heart and soul. And it would have  hand  in that it would be greatly crafted. So I started thinking about how am I going to do this biennial  how am I going to travel the world and find these artists  And then I realized one day  there's an easier solution to this. I'm just going to make the whole thing myself. And so this is what I did. So I thought  a biennial needs artists. I'm going to do an international biennial  I need artists from all around the world. So what I did was I invented a hundred artists from around the world. I figured out their bios  their passions in life and their art styles  and I started making their work. I felt  oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing. So I decided  I'm going to make this a real biennial. It's going to be two years of studio work. And I'm going to create this in two years  and I have. So I should start to talk about these guys. Well the range is quite a bit. And I'm such a technician  so I loved this project  getting to play with all the techniques. So for example  in realist paintings  it ranges from this  which is kind of old masters style  to really realistic still life  to this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair. And then at the other end  there's performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation and this one  and outdoor installations like this one and this one. I know I should mention  I'm making all these things. This isn't Photoshopped. I'm under the river with those fish. So now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you. This is Nell Remmel. Nell is interested in agricultural processes  and her work is based in these practices. This piece  which is called  Flipped Earth     she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground. And by taking giant mirrors    and here she's taking giant mirrors and pulling them into the dirt. And this is    feet long. And what I loved about her work is  when I would walk around it and look down into the sky  looking down to watch the sky  and it unfolded in a new way. And probably the best part of this piece is at dusk and dawn when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark  but there's still the light above  bright above. And so you're standing there and everything else is dark  but there's this portal that you want to jump in. This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas. And I love to dig a hole. So this piece was great fun because it was two days of digging in soft dirt. The next artist is Kay Overstry  and she's interested in ephemerality and transience. And in her most recent project  it's called  Weather I Made.  And she's making weather on her body's scale. And this piece is  Frost.  And what she did was she went out on a cold  dry night and breathed back and forth on the lawn to leave    to leave her life's mark  the mark of her life. And so this is five foot  five inches of frost that she left behind. The sun rises  and it melts away. And that was played by my mom. So the next artist  this is a group of Japanese artists  a collective of Japanese artists    in Tokyo. And they were interested in developing a new  alternative art space  and they needed funding for it  so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects. One of these is scratch off masterpieces. And so what they're doing    each of these artists on a nine by seven inch card  which they sell for    bucks  they drew original works of art. And you buy one  and maybe you get a real piece  and maybe not. Well this has sparked a craze in Japan  because everyone's wanting a masterpiece. And the ones that are the most sought after are the ones that are only barely scratched off. And all these works  in some way  talk about luck or fate or chance. Those first two are portraits of mega jackpot winners years before and after their win. And in this one it's called  Drawing the Short Stick.  I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home who introduced me    which I think is such a great introduction    to a friend one day as   This is my cousin Shea. He draws sticks real good.  Which is one of the best compliments ever. This artist is Gus Weinmueller  and he's doing a project  a large project  called  Art for the Peoples.  And within this project  he's doing a smaller project called  Artists in Residence.  And what he does is    he spends a week at a time with a family. And he shows up on their porch  their doorstep  with a toothbrush and pajamas  and he's ready to spend the week with them. And using only what's present  he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of. And he spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is. He has all these discussions with their family  and he digs through everything they have  and he finds materials to make work. And he makes a work that answers what they think great art is. For this family  he made this still life painting. And whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property. This next project  this is by Jaochim Parisvega  and he's interested in    he believes art is everywhere waiting    that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen. And he provides this push by harnessing natural forces  like in his series where he used rain to make paintings. This project is called  Love Nests.  What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him. So he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them  and they crafted his nests for him. And this one's called  Lovelock's Nest.  This one's called  Mixtape Love Song's Nest.  And this one's called  Lovemaking Nest.  Next is Sylvia Slater. Sylvia's interested in art training. She's a very serious Swiss artist. And she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos ridden places and developing countries  and she was thinking  what can I make that would be of value to them  in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman  And so she came up with creating these pocket sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them. And you would carry this around with you  and if everything went to hell  you could make payments and buy your life. So this life price is for an irrigation non profit director. So hopefully what happens is you never use it  and it's an heirloom that you pass down. And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments  or they could be like these  which are leaves that can be payments. And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones. And this one had to get broken up. He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently. This is by a duo  Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland. And they're interested in creating culture  just tradition. So what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area. So this is in Eastern Tennessee  and what they decided was that we need a positive tradition that goes with death. So they came up with  dig jigs.  And a dig jig    a dig jig is where  for a milestone anniversary or a birthday  you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you're going to be buried. And we got a lot of attention when we did it. I talked my family into doing this  and they didn't know what I was doing. And I was like   Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work.  And so we got to the grave and made this  which was hilarious    the attention that we got. So what happens is you dance on the grave  and after you've done your dance  everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are. And you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for. That's my mom and dad. This is by Jason Birdsong. He is interested in how we see as an animal  how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage. You know  we look down a dark alley or a jungle path  trying to make out a face or a creature. We just have that natural way of seeing. And he plays with this idea. And this piece  those aren't actually leaves. They're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage. So he pairs these up. There's another pile of leaves. Those are actually all real butterfly specimens. And he pairs these up with paintings. Like this is a painting of a snake in a box. So you open the box and you think   Whoa  there's a snake in there.  But it's actually a painting. So he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage. The next artist is Hazel Clausen. Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided   You know  I would learn a lot about culture if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch.  So that's what she did. She created the Swiss people named the Uvulites  and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for. And also they reference how the uvula    everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit. And that's the symbol of their culture. And this is from a documentary called  Sexual Practices and Populations Control Among the Uvulites.  This is a typical angora embroidery for them. This is one of their founders  Gert Schaeffer. And actually this is my Aunt Irene. It was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things. And I crack up at this piece  because when I see it I know that's French angora and all antique German ribbons and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill and carried around for    years and then antique Chinese skirts. The next is a collective of artists called the Silver Dobermans  and their motto is to spread pragmatism one person at a time. And they're really interested in how over coddled we've become. So this is one of their comments on how over coddled we've become. And what they've done is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence. And this is called  Horse Sense Fence.  The next artist is K. M. Yoon  a really interesting South Korean artist. And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition of scholar stones. Next is Maynard Sipes. And I love Maynard Sipes  but he's off in his own world  and  bless his heart  he's so paranoid. Next is Roy Penig  a really interesting Kentucky artist  and he's the nicest guy. He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly. Next is an Australian artist  Janeen Jackson  and this is from a project of hers called  What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching.  Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller  Jurgi Petrauskas. Next is Ginger Cheshire. This is from a short film of hers called  The Last Person.  And that's my cousin and my sister's dog  Gabby. The next  this is by Sam Sandy. He's an Australian Aboriginal elder  and he's also an artist. And this is from a large traveling sculpture project that he's doing. This is from Estelle Willoughsby. She heals with color. And she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists  even though she's going to be    next year. This is by Z. Zhou  and he's interested in stasis. Next is by Hilda Singh  and she's doing a whole project called  Social Outfits.  Next is by Vera Sokolova. And I have to say  Vera kind of scares me. You can't look her directly in the eyes because she's kind of scary. And it's good that she's not real  she'd be mad that I said that. And she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg  and she plays with optics. Next  this is by Thomas Swifton. This is from a short film   Adventures with Skinny.  And this is by Cicily Bennett  and it's from a series of short films. And after this one  there's    other artists. And all together with those other    you're not seeing  that's my biennial. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. I'm here today to start a revolution. Now before you get up in arms  or you break into song  or you pick a favorite color  I want to define what I mean by revolution. By revolution  I mean a drastic and far reaching change in the way we think and behave    the way we think and the way we behave. Now why  Steve  why do we need a revolution  We need a revolution because things aren't working  they're just not working. And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working. You know  I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential. I'm sick and tired of us being last. And we are last place in so many things    for example  social factors. We're last place in Europe in innovation. There we are right at the end  right at the bottom  last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation. We're last place in health care  and that's important for a sense of well being. And there we are  not just last in the E.U.  we're last in Europe  at the very bottom. And worst of all  it just came out three weeks ago  many of you have seen it  The Economist. We're the saddest place on Earth  relative to GDP per capita    the saddest place on Earth. That's social. Let's look at education. Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD  Last in reading  math and science. Last. Business  The lowest perception in the E.U. that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society. Why as a result  what happens  The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses. And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies. We hire the most people  we create the most taxes. So if our engine's broken  guess what  Last in Europe GDP per capita. Last. So it's no surprise  guys  that    percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future. We're unhappy  we have bad education  and we have the worst businesses. And these are facts  guys. This isn't story tale  it's not make believe. It's not. It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts. So I think it should be really  really clear that our system is broken. The way we think  the way we behave  our operating system of behaving is broken. We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better  for ourselves  for our friends  for our family and for our future. How did this happen  Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen  I think we're last because    and this is going to be drastic to some of you    because we are handicapping ourselves. We're holding ourselves back because we don't value play. I said  play   all right. In case some of you forgot what play is  this is what play looks like. Babies play  kids play  adults play. We don't value play. In fact  we devalue play. And we devalue it in three areas. Let's go back to the same three areas. Social     years of what  Of communism    of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing  inadvertently  creativity  individual self expression and innovation. And instead  what do we value  Because it's shown the way we apply  generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context  which told us what in communism  To be serious. To be really  really serious. It did. Be serious. I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground. Heaven forbid they play in the dirt  the kal  or even worse  lokvi  water    that will kill them. I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life. We have a serious meme running through. It's a social gene running through us. It's a serious gene. It's    years of it that's created what I call the  baba factor.  And here's how it works. Step one  woman says   I want to have a baby. Iskam baby.  Step two  we get the baby. Woohoo  But then what happens in step three  I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees. I'm going to give bebko to baba. But we need to remember that baba's been infected by the serious meme for    years. So what happens  She passes that virus on to baby  and it takes a really  really  really long time    as the redwood trees    for that serious meme to get out of our operating system. What happens then  It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for     years  that values rote learning  memorization and standardization  and devalues self expression  self exploration  questioning  creativity and play. It's a crap system. True story  I went looking for a school for my kid. We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math    times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff. And we said   Well what about play and recess   And they said   Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule.  And we said   He's five.  What a crime. What a crime. And it's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we're creating mindless  robotic workers to put bolts in pre drilled holes. But I'm sorry  the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution. We need adaptability  the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative. We don't need mechanized workers. But no  now our meme goes into work where we don't value play. We create robotic workers that we treat like assets  to lever and just throw away. What are qualities of a Bulgarian work  Autocratic    do what I say because I'm the chef. I'm the boss and I know better than you. Untrusting    you're obviously a criminal  so I'm going to install cameras. Controlling    you're obviously an idiot  so I'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box. So they're restrictive    don't use your mobile phone  don't use your laptop  don't search the Internet  don't be on I.M. That's somehow unprofessional and bad. And at the end of the day  it's unfulfilling because you're controlled  you're restricted  you're not valued and you're not having any fun. In social  in education and in our business  don't value play. And that's why we're last  because we don't value play. And you can say   That's ridiculous  Steve. What a dumb idea. It can't be because of play. Just play  that's a stupid thing.  We have the serious meme in us. Well I'm going to say no. And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech    that play is the catalyst  it is the revolution  that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better. Play  our brains are hardwired for play. Evolution has selected  over millions and billions of years  for play in animals and in humans. And you know what  Evolution does a really  really good job of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage. Nature isn't stupid  and it selected for play. Throughout the animal kingdom  for example  ants. Ants play. Maybe you didn't know that. But when they're playing  they're learning the social order and dynamics of things. Rats play  but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better  skills. Kittens play. We all know kittens play. But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially. They can still hunt  but they can't be social. Bears play. But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer. It's not the bears that learn how to fish better. It's the ones that play more. And a final really interesting study    it's been shown  a correlation between play and brain size. The more you play  the bigger the brains there are. Dolphins  pretty big brains  play a lot. But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players  Yours truly  humans. Kids play  we play    of every nationality  of every race  of every color  of every religion. It's a universal thing    we play. And it's not just kids  it's adults too. Really cool term  neoteny    the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults. And who are the biggest neotenists  Humans. We play sports. We do it for fun  or as Olympians  or as professionals. We play musical instruments. We dance  we kiss  we sing  we just goof around. We're designed by nature to play from birth to old age. We're designed to do that continuously    to play and play a lot and not stop playing. It is a huge benefit. Just like there's benefits to animals  there's benefits to humans. For example  it's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala  in the area where it controls emotions. It's been shown to promote pre frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening. As a result  what happens  We develop more emotional maturity if we play more. We develop better decision making ability if we play more. These guys are facts. It's not fiction  it's not story tales  it's not make believe  it's cold  hard science. These are the benefits to play. It is a genetic birthright that we have  like walking or speaking or seeing. And if we handicap ourselves with play  we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have. We hold ourselves back. Little exercise just for a second  close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play. Imagine a world without theater  without the arts  without song  without dancing  without soccer  without football  without laughter. What does this world look like  It's pretty bleak. It's pretty glum. Now imagine your workplace. Is it fun  Is it playful  Or maybe the workplace of your friends    here we're forward thinking. Is it fun  Is it playful  Or is it crap  Is it autocratic  controlling  restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling  We have this concept that the opposite of play is work. We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.  Oh  my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work   or   Oh  I've got to hide because my boss might see me. He's going to think I'm not working hard.  But I have news for you  our thinking is backwards. The opposite of play is not work. The opposite of play is depression. It's depression. In fact  play improves our work. Just like there's benefits for humans and animals  there's benefits for play at work. For example  it stimulates creativity. It increases our openness to change. It improves our ability to learn. It provides a sense of purpose and mastery    two key motivational things that increase productivity  through play. So before you start thinking of play as just not serious  play doesn't mean frivolous. You know  the professional athlete that loves skiing  he's serious about it  but he loves it. He's having fun  he's in the groove  he's in the flow. A doctor might be serious  but laughter's still a great medicine. Our thinking is backwards. We shouldn't be feeling guilty. We should be celebrating play. Quick example from the corporate world. FedEx  easy motto  people  service  profit. If you treat your people like people  if you treat them great  they're happier  they're fulfilled  they have a sense of mastery and purpose. What happens  They give better service    not worse  but better. And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled  how do the customers feel  They feel great. And what do great customers do  great feeling customers  They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends  which leads to more profit. People  service  profit. Play increases productivity  not decreases. And you're going to say   Gee  that can work for FedEx out there in the United States  but it can't work in Bulgaria. No way. We're different.  It does work in Bulgaria  you guys. Two reasons. One  play is universal. There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play  besides the serious meme that we have to kick out. Two  I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant. When I got there  we had zero happy customers. Not one customer would refer us. I asked them all. We had marginal profit    I did. We had marginal profits  and we had unhappy stakeholders. Through some basic change  change like improving transparency  change like promoting self direction and collaboration  encouraging collaboration  not autocracy  the things like having a results focus. I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave. I care that your customer and your team is happy and you're organized with that. Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock  Basically promoting fun. Through promoting fun and a great environment  we were able to transform Sciant and  in just three short years    sounds like a long time  but change is slow    every customer  from zero to every customer referring us  above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders. And you can say   Well how do you know they're happy   Well we did win  every year that we entered  one of the rankings for best employer for small business. Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys. It does  and it can  work in Bulgaria. There's nothing holding us back  except our own mentality about play. So some steps that we can take    to finish up    how to make this revolution through play. First of all  you have to believe me. If you don't believe me  well just go home and think about it some more or something. Second of all  if you don't have the feeling of play in you  you need to rediscover play. Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy  that you enjoyed only six months ago  but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy  because you feel like you have to be serious  rediscover it. I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game. Rediscover that because you're the leaders  the innovation leaders  the thought leaders. You're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution. You guys have to  and if you're not feeling it  your colleagues  your employees  aren't going to feel it. You've got to go back and say   Hey  I'm going to trust you.  Weird concept  I hired you  I should trust you. I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you  and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level  rather than the top. I'm going to encourage constructive criticism. I'm going to let you challenge authority. Because it's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today. We're not always right as leaders. We're going to eradicate fear. Fear is the enemy of play. And we're going to do things like eliminate restrictions. You know what  let them use their mobile phone for personal calls    heaven forbid. Let them be on the Internet. Let them be on instant messengers. Let them take long lunches. Lunch is like the recess for work. It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain  you meet your friends  you have a beer  you have some food  you talk  you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn't have had before. Let them do it. Give them some freedom  and in general  let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace. We spend so much of our lives at the workplace  and it's supposed to be  what  a miserable grind  so that    years from now  we wake up and say   Is this it  Is that all there was   Unacceptable. Nepriemliv. So in summary  we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave  but we don't need a workers' revolution. We don't need a workers' revolution. What we need is a players' uprising. What we need is a players' uprising. What we need is a players' uprising. Seriously  we need to band together. Today is the start of the uprising. But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution. You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives  our schools  and our work with play  about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment  of how play promotes innovation and productivity  and  ultimately  how play creates meaning. Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together  and together  if we do this and share these ideas on play  we can transform Bulgaria for the better. Thank you. As an artist  connection is very important to me. Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected. I first went to Antarctica almost    years ago  where I saw my first icebergs. I was in awe. My heart beat fast  my head was dizzy  trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me. The icebergs around me were almost     feet out of the water  and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake  year after year. Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves. Each iceberg has its own individual personality. They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end  while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion. It's easy to think  when you look at an iceberg  that they're isolated  that they're separate and alone  much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves. But the reality is far from it. As an iceberg melts  I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere. As the iceberg melts  it is releasing mineral rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life. I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors  knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again. It is not a death when they melt  it is not an end  but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life. Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young    a couple thousand years old. And some of the ice is over         years old. The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq  Greenland. It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling. So here it is. You can see on the left side a small boat. That's about a    foot boat. And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline. You can see here  it begins to roll  and the boat has moved to the other side  and the man is standing there. This is an average size Greenlandic iceberg. It's about     feet above the water  or    meters. And this video is real time. And just like that  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality. Thank you. By birth and by choice  I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life  and for the past    years  I've worked at Ford Motor Company. And for most of those years  I worried about  how am I going to sell more cars and trucks  But today I worry about  what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks  What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles  triples  or even quadruples  My life is guided by two great passions  and the first is automobiles. I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company. I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway. And I decided about that time  about age     that it would be really cool if I was a test driver. So my parents would go to dinner. They'd sit down  I'd sneak out of the house. I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway  and it was a blast. And that went on for about two years  until    I think I was about       my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III. And it was snowing that day. So he and mom went to dinner  and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure eights in the snow. My dad finished dinner early that evening. And he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car    and almost ended up in the front hall. So it kind of cooled my test driving for a little while. But I really began to love cars then. And my first car was a      electric green Mustang. And even though the color was pretty hideous  I did love the car  and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on to this day. But cars are really more than a passion of mine  they're quite literally in my blood. My great grandfather was Henry Ford  and on my mother's side  my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone. So when I was born  I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me. But my great grandfather  Henry Ford  really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them. Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress. And that's a belief that I share. My other great passion is the environment. And as a young boy  I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about. And it really struck me as the years went by  in a very negative way  when I would go to some stream that I'd loved  and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies  and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it. And so even at a young age  that really resonated with me  and the whole notion of environmental preservation  at a very basic level  sunk in with me. As a high schooler  I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey  and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world. But it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature. And that was true until I got to college. And when I got to college  you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country. They thought that we were more interested  as an industry  in profits  rather than progress  and that we filled the skies with smog    and frankly  we were the enemy. I joined Ford after college  after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do. But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there. And as I look back over    years ago  it was a little naive to think at that age that I could. But I wanted to. And I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong. In fact  when I got back to Detroit  my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company  and certainly by those in the industry. I had some very interesting conversations  as you can imagine. There were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with  environmental wackos.  I was considered a radical. And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists. Of course  I had no intention of doing that  and I kept speaking out about the environment  and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability. And in time  my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today. I mean  I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it. And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues  of cars and the environment    not only at Ford  but really as an industry. We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights. And with new technology  we're reducing    and I believe  someday we'll eliminate    CO  emissions. We're starting to sell electric cars  which is great. We're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word    economically  socially and environmentally. And actually  although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do  I can see the day where my two great passions    cars and the environment    actually come into harmony. But unfortunately  as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem    and as I said  we're not there yet  we've got a lot of work to do  but I can see where we will    but even as we're in the process of doing that  another huge problem is looming  and people aren't noticing. And that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened  just as the environment is. The problem  put in its simplest terms  is one of mathematics. Today there are approximately  .  billion people in the world  and within our lifetime  that number's going to grow to about nine billion. And at that population level  our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth. And with that growth comes some severe practical problems  one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it. When we look at the population growth in terms of cars  it becomes even clearer. Today there are about     million cars on the road worldwide. But with more people and greater prosperity around the world  that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century. And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before. Now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives. Today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams  and that's a huge waste of time and resources. But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest. Today the average driver in Beijing has a five hour commute. And last summer    many of you probably saw this    there was a hundred mile traffic jam that took    days to clear in China. In the decades to come     percent of the world's population will live in cities  and    of those cities will be of    million people or more. So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing. When you factor in population growth  it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow. Frankly  four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars  and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam. So  if we make no changes today  what does tomorrow look like  Well I think you probably already have the picture. Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge  and they're really very  very inconvenient  but that's all they are. But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care  particularly to people that live in city centers. And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised. So what's going to solve this  Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same. My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T   If I had asked people then what they wanted  they would have answered  'We want faster horses.'  So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads. When America began moving west  we didn't add more wagon trains  we built railroads. And to connect our country after World War II  we didn't build more two lane highways  we built the interstate highway system. Today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future. We are going to build smart cars  but we also need to build smart roads  smart parking  smart public transportation systems and more. We don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic  sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots. We need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers. And frankly  that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable. Now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world. The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another  and they go underneath the city streets. And up above  you've got a series of pedestrian walkways. On New York City's   th Street  gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle specific corridors. Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created  and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about    minutes. Now if you look at Hong Kong  they have a very interesting system called Octopus there. It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system. So parking garages  buses  trains  they all operate within the same system. Now shared car services are also springing up around the world  and these efforts  I think  are great. They're relieving congestion  and they're frankly starting to save some fuel. These are all really good ideas that will move us forward. But what really inspires me is what's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other. Very soon  the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network. Every morning I drive about    miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn  Michigan. And every night I go home  my commute is a total crapshoot. And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home. But very soon we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other. So if the car ahead of me on I    hits traffic  it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way. And these systems are being tested right now  and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon. But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless. So just imagine  one day very soon  you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system. So you get in your car  and as you get in your car  your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive    no more driving around looking for one  which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas    is looking for parking spots. Or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one. Or being at a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time. This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system. So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem. But as we found out with addressing CO  issues  and also fossil fuels  there is no one silver bullet. The solution is not going to be more cars  more roads or a new rail system  it can only be found  I believe  in a global network of interconnected solutions. Now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work  but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions    whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet  our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options. We need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue. Companies  entrepreneurs  venture capitalists  they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity  as well as an enormous social problem. And just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge    and it's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power  how much money and how much serious thought has  really over the last three years  just poured into the green energy field. We need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock. But we need people like all of you in this room  leading thinkers. I mean  frankly  I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue. And we need people from all walks of life  not just inventors  we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge. This isn't going to be solved by any one person or one group. It's going to really require a national energy policy  frankly for each country  because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels  traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are. But we need to get going  and we need to get going today. And we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future. You know  we've come a long way. Since the Model T  most people never traveled more than    miles from home in their entire lifetime. And since then  the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live  where we work  where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around. We don't want to regress and lose that freedom. We're on our way to solving    and as I said earlier  I know we've got a long way to go    the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it  and that's the environmental issue  but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock. Because in doing so  we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted  which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world. And it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this. Because  if you can envision  as I do  a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today  that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow. I believe we're at our best when we're confronted with big issues. This is a big one  and it won't wait. So let's get started now. Thank you. I'm a savant  or more precisely  a high functioning autistic savant. It's a rare condition. And rarer still when accompanied  as in my case  by self awareness and a mastery of language. Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me  there's a certain kind of awkwardness. I can see it in their eyes. They want to ask me something. And in the end  quite often  the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out   If I give you my date of birth  can you tell me what day of the week I was born on   Or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text. I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one man savant show for you today. I'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots    a little deeper and a lot closer  to my mind  than work. I want to talk to you briefly about perception. When he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name  Anton Chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him    little details that other people seem to miss. Every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life  I'm reminded of why I too became a writer. In my books  I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding. Here are three questions drawn from my work. Rather than try to figure them out  I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them. For example  the calculation  can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall  Or look at the foreign word and the sounds  can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards  And in terms of the line of poetry  why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit  I'm asking you to do this because I believe our personal perceptions  you see  are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge. Aesthetic judgments  rather than abstract reasoning  guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know. I'm an extreme example of this. My worlds of words and numbers blur with color  emotion and personality. As Juan said  it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia  an unusual cross talk between the senses. Here are the numbers one to    as I see them    every number with its own shape and character. One is a flash of white light. Six is a tiny and very sad black hole. The sketches are in black and white here  but in my mind they have colors. Three is green. Four is blue. Five is yellow. I paint as well. And here is one of my paintings. It's a multiplication of two prime numbers. Three dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape  the answer to the sum. What about bigger numbers  Well you can't get much bigger than Pi  the mathematical constant. It's an infinite number    literally goes on forever. In this painting that I made of the first    decimals of Pi  I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape. But it's not only numbers that I see in colors. Words too  for me  have colors and emotions and textures. And this is an opening phrase from the novel  Lolita.  And Nabokov was himself synesthetic. And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out. Another example  a little bit more mathematical. And I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from  The Great Gatsby.  There is a procession of syllables    wheat  one  prairies  two  lost Swede towns  three    one  two  three. And this effect is very pleasant on the mind  and it helps the sentence to feel right. Let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago.    multiplied by   . If some of you play chess  you'll know that    is a square number  and that's why chessboards  eight by eight  have    squares. So that gives us a form that we can picture  that we can perceive. What about     Well if      if we think of     as being like a square     would look like this. So what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind    something like this.    becomes      . And in the right hand corner  you don't have to calculate anything. Four across  four up and down    it's   . So what the sum is actually asking you to do is           . That's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math  I'm sure. It's                                 the answer to the sum. Easy when you know how. The second question was an Icelandic word. I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic. So let me narrow the choices down to two. Hnugginn  is it a happy word  or a sad word  What do you say  Okay. Some people say it's happy. Most people  a majority of people  say sad. And it actually means sad. Why do  statistically  a majority of people say that a word is sad  in this case  heavy in other cases  In my theory  language evolves in such a way that sounds match  correspond with  the subjective  with the personal  intuitive experience of the listener. Let's have a look at the third question. It's a line from a poem by John Keats. Words  like numbers  express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world. It stands to reason that we  existing in this world  should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships. And poets  like other artists  play with those intuitive understandings. In the case of hare  it's an ambiguous sound in English. It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head. And if we think of that    let me put the picture up    the fibers represent vulnerability. They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion. So what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension. The hare itself  the animal    not a cat  not a dog  a hare    why a hare  Because think of the picture    not the word  the picture. The overlong ears  the overlarge feet  helps us to picture  to feel intuitively  what it means to limp and to tremble. So in these few minutes  I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions  numbers  shapes and personalities. The world is richer  vaster than it too often seems to be. I hope that I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes. Thank you. You know  what I do is write for children  and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author  in fact. And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist. You can have me as a farmer  or in leathers  and no one has ever chose farmer. I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies. And you know  an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace. You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany. That's a painting of a circle. A friend of mine did that    Richard Bollingbroke. It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about. My circle began back in the '  s in high school in Stow  Ohio where I was the class queer. I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room  until one teacher saved my life. She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge. She did it in secret. She did it for three years. And I had to get out of town. I had a thumb  I had    dollars  and I ended up in San Francisco  California    met a lover    and back in the '  s  found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations. About three or four years ago  I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher  Mrs. Posten  who said   I need to see you. I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. Could you please come to Ohio  and please bring that man that I know you have found by now. And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer  and I'd like you to please be quick about this.  Well  the next day we were in Cleveland. We took a look at her  we laughed  we cried  and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice. We found her one  we got her there  and we took care of her and watched over her family  because it was necessary. It's something we knew how to do. And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me  she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands. And what had happened was the circle had closed  it had become a circle    and that epiphany I talked about presented itself. The epiphany is that death is a part of life. She saved my life  I and my partner saved hers. And you know  that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does. It needs truth and beauty  and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today. It also needs    it needs dignity  love and pleasure  and it's our job to hand those things out. Thank you. Space  we all know what it looks like. We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives  from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space  we have no sense of what space sounds like. And indeed  most people associate space with silence. But the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking. And yet despite this  hardly any of us have ever heard space. How many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star  Well in case you've ever wondered  this is what the Sun sounds like. This is the planet Jupiter. And this is the space probe Cassini pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn. This is a a highly condensed clump of neutral matter  spinning in the distant universe. So my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe. And you may wonder  how do we know what these sounds are  How can we tell the difference between the sound of the Sun and the sound of a pulsar  Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy. Radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers  which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky. And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth  we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques. And therefore  it's through listening that we've come to uncover some of the universe's most important secrets    its scale  what it's made of and even how old it is. So today  I'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening. It's punctuated by three quick anecdotes  which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space. Now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft  but a rather more humble technology    and in fact  the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today  the telephone. It's       it's in Boston  and this is Alexander Graham Bell who was working with Thomas Watson on the invention of the telephone. A key part of their technical set up was a half mile long length of wire  which was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in Boston. The line carried the telephone signals that would later make Bell a household name. But like any long length of charged wire  it also inadvertently became an antenna. Thomas Watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected. Now you have to remember  this is    years before Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves       years before Nikola Tesla's four tuned circuit    nearly    years before Marconi's first broadcast. So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us. We didn't have the technology to transmit. So what were these strange noises  Watson was in fact listening to very low frequency radio emissions caused by nature. Some of the crackles and pops were lightning  but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin. Using the very first telephone  Watson was in fact dialed into the heavens. As he correctly guessed  some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the Sun. It was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to    a phenomena which we can see at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet as the aurora. So whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution  Watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves. He had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them. Fast forward    years  and Bell and Watson's technology has completely transformed global communications. But going from slinging some wire across rooftops in Boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the Atlantic Ocean seabed is no easy matter. And so before long  Bell were looking to new technologies to optimize their revolution. Radio could carry sound without wires. But the medium is lossy    it's subject to a lot of noise and interference. So Bell employed an engineer to study those noises  to try and find out where they came from  with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec  which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony. Most of the noises that the engineer  Karl Jansky  investigated were fairly prosaic in origin. They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power. But there was one persistent noise that Jansky couldn't identify  and it seemed to appear in his radio headset four minutes earlier each day. Now any astronomer will tell you  this is the telltale sign of something that doesn't originate from Earth. Jansky had made a historic discovery  that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves. Fifty years on from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun  Jansky's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration  the radio astronomy age. Over the next few years  astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers and learned about our radio sky  about Jupiter and the Sun  by listening. Let's jump ahead again. It's       and we're back at Bell Labs. And once again  two scientists have got a problem with noise. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were using the horn antenna at Bell's Holmdel laboratory to study the Milky Way with extraordinary precision. They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity. There was a glitch in their soundtrack. A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research. It was in the microwave range  and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously. Now this didn't make any sense  and like any reasonable engineer or scientist  they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself  it must be the dish. There were pigeons roosting in the dish. And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings  get the disk kind of operational again  normal operations would resume. But the noise didn't disappear. The mysterious noise that Penzias and Wilson were listening to turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound that anyone had ever heard. It was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe. This was the first experimental evidence that the Big Bang existed and the universe was born at a precise moment some   .  billion years ago. So our story ends at the beginning    the beginning of all things  the Big Bang. This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard    the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear  the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang. Thanks. My name is Joshua Walters. I'm a performer. But as far as being a performer  I'm also diagnosed bipolar. I reframe that as a positive because the crazier I get onstage  the more entertaining I become. When I was    in San Francisco  I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ. Maybe you thought that was scary  but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ. I was sent to a place  a psych ward  and in the psych ward  everyone is doing their own one man show. There's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time. They're just practicing. One day they'll get here. Now when I got out  I was diagnosed and I was given medications by a psychiatrist.  Okay  Josh  why don't we give you some    why don't we give you some Zyprexa. Okay  Mmhmm  At least that's what it says on my pen.  Some of you are in the field  I can see. I can feel your noise. The first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode  and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs  where I was sleeping through high school. The second half was just one big nap  pretty much  in class. When I got out I had a choice. I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness. There's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive    at least the hypomanic edge part of it. Now if you don't know what hypomania is  it's like an engine that's out of control  maybe a Ferrari engine  with no breaks. Many of the speakers here  many of you in the audience  have that creative edge  if you know what I'm talking about. You're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible. And there's a book    John Gartner. John Gartner wrote this book called  The Hypomanic Edge  in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete. A different book was written not too long ago in the mid   s called  Touched With Fire  by Kay Redfield Jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with. Some of them committed suicide. So it wasn't all the good side of the illness. Now recently  there's been development in this field. And there was an article written in the New York Times  September       that stated   Just Manic Enough.  Just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum    you know what I'm talking about    not maybe full bipolar  but they're in the bipolar spectrum    where on one side  maybe you think you're Jesus  and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money. Your call. Your call. And everyone's somewhere in the middle. Everyone's somewhere in the middle. So maybe  you know  there's no such thing as crazy  and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy. But maybe it just means you're more sensitive to what most people can't see or feel. Maybe no one's really crazy. Everyone is just a little bit mad. How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum. How much depends on how lucky you are. Thank you. My name is Emiliano Salinas and I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now. I was born in     . I grew up in a traditional Mexican family. As a child  I had a pretty normal life  I would go to school  play with my friends and cousins. But then my father became President of Mexico and my life changed. What I'm about to say  at least some of what I'm about to say  will cause controversy. Firstly  because I'm the one who's going to say it. And secondly  because what I'm going to say is true  and it will make a lot of people nervous because it's something we don't want to hear. But it's imperative that we listen because it's undeniable and definitive. It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons. I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon  and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence. I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son from the fact that I'm a citizen concerned about the country's current situation. Don't worry. It's not necessary for understanding the importance of what I'm going to say. I think we have a problem in Mexico. We have a big problem. I think there's consensus on this. No one argues    we all agree there's a problem. What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is. Is it the Zetas  The drug traffickers  The government  Corruption  Poverty  Or is it something else  I think none of these is the problem. I don't mean they don't deserve attention. But we won't be able to take care of any of those things if we don't solve the real problem we have in Mexico first. The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans  we believe we are victims of our circumstances. We are a country of victims. Historically  we've always acted as victims of something or somebody. We were victims of the Spaniards. Then we were victims of the French. Then we were victims of Don Porfirio. Then we were victims of the PRI. Even of Salinas. And of El Peje. And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ... Hold on  Wait a minute  What if none of these things is the problem  The problem is not the things we feel victims of. The problem is that we play the role of victims. We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims. If only we stopped feeling like victims  if we stopped acting as victims  our country would change so much  I'm going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible  involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands. I'm going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence  from weakest to strongest. The first level  the weakest level of civil response against violence  is denial and apathy. Today  much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we're going through. We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances. Daily life in our country is  to say the least  under extraordinary  exceptional circumstances. It's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it's the flu and it will just go away. We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu. But it doesn't. Mexico has cancer. And if we don't do something about it  the cancer will end up killing it. We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response  which is  effectively  recognition. And that recognition will sow fear    recognizing the seriousness of the situation. But  fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something. Many people in Mexico are afraid today. We're very afraid. And we're acting out of that fear. And let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear    and this is the second level of civil response  fear. Let's think about Mexican streets  they're unsafe because of violence  so people stay at home. Does that make streets more or less safe  Less safe  So streets become more desolate and unsafe  so we stay home more    which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe  and we stay home even more. This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses  scared to death    even more afraid than when we were out on the streets. We need to confront this fear. We need to move Mexican society  the members of society who are at this level  to the next level  which is action. We need to face our fears and take back our streets  our cities  our neighborhoods. For many people  acting involves courage. We go from fear to courage. They say   I can't take it anymore. Let's do something about it.  Recently    this is a sensitive figure       public lynchings have been recorded so far in      in Mexico. Usually it's one or two a year. Now we're experiencing one every week. This shows that society is desperate and it's taking the law into its own hands. Unfortunately  violent action    though action is better than no action    but taking part in it only disguises violence. If I'm violent with you and you respond with violence  you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence. So civil action is vital  but it's also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level  which is non violent action. It's pacific  coordinated civil action  which doesn't mean passive action. It means it's determined and effective  but not violent. There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico. Two years ago  in Galena City  Chihuahua  a member of the community was kidnapped  Eric Le Bar n. His brothers  Benjam n and Juli n  got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action  to pay the ransom  to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help. In the end  Benjam n and Juli n decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together. So what did they do  They mobilized the whole community of Le Bar n to go to Chihuahua  where they organized a sit in in the central park of the city. They sent a message to the kidnappers   If you want your ransom come and get it. We'll be waiting for you right here.  They stayed there. Seven days later  Eric was set free and was able to return home. This is an example of what an organized society can do  a society that acts. Of course  criminals can respond. And in this case  they did. On July  th        Benjam n Le Bar n was murdered. But Juli n Le Bar n keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year. And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head. But he keeps fighting. He keeps organizing. He keeps mobilizing. These heroic acts are present all over the country. With a thousand Juli ns working together  Mexico would be a very different country. And they're out there  They just have to raise their hands. I was born in Mexico  I grew up in Mexico and along the way  I learned to love Mexico. I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land    not to mention all Mexican people    will agree that it's not difficult to love Mexico. I've traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have. That devotion we feel for the national football team. That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters  such as the earthquake in      or this year's floods. The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem since we were kids. When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy  and we sang  with a childlike heart   a soldier in each son.  I think the biggest insult  the worst way you can offend a Mexican is to insult their mother. A mother is the most sacred thing in life. Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children. We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history. Our mother  Mexico  is being violated before our very eyes. What are we going to do  Masiosare  the strange enemy  is here. Where is the soldier in each son  Mahatma Gandhi  one of the greatest civil fighters of all time  said   Be the change you wish to see in the world.  Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis. We need Gandhis. We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action. This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative. This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico    the festivals  the markets  the restaurants  the cantinas  the tequila  the mariachis  the serenades  the posadas  El Grito  the Day of the Dead  San Miguel  the joy  the passion for life  the fight and everything it means to be Mexican    doesn't disappear from this world. We're facing a very powerful opponent. But we are many more. They can take a man's life. Anyone can kill me  or you  or you. But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans. The battle is won  but we still have to fight it.      years ago  the Roman poet Juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true Mexican. He said   Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor  and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living.  Thank you. I'd like to begin with a thought experiment. Imagine that it's       years into the future. Civilization as we know it has ceased to exist    no books  no electronic devices  no Facebook or Twitter. All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost. Now imagine archeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities. What might they find  Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them. Perhaps some circular pieces of metal. Maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them. And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers    buried in the hills somewhere in North America    massive versions of these same symbols. Now let's ask ourselves  what could such artifacts say about us to people       years into the future  This is no hypothetical question. In fact  this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization  which existed       years ago. The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations  but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations. It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers  covering what is now Pakistan  Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran. Given that it was such a vast civilization  you might expect to find really powerful rulers  kings  and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings. In fact  what archeologists have found is none of that. They've found small objects such as these. Here's an example of one of these objects. Well obviously this is a replica. But who is this person  A king  A god  A priest  Or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me  We don't know. But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them. Well no  not pieces of plastic  but stone seals  copper tablets  pottery and  surprisingly  one large sign board  which was found buried near the gate of a city. Now we don't know if it says Hollywood  or even Bollywood for that matter. In fact  we don't even know what any of these objects say  and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered. We don't know what any of these symbols mean. The symbols are most commonly found on seals. So you see up there one such object. It's the square object with the unicorn like animal on it. Now that's a magnificent piece of art. So how big do you think that is  Perhaps that big  Or maybe that big  Well let me show you. Here's a replica of one such seal. It's only about one inch by one inch in size    pretty tiny. So what were these used for  We know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other. So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes  These were used to make those kinds of packing slips. You might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text. Perhaps they're the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other    we don't know. We need to decipher the script to answer that question. Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle  it's actually become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia. In fact  the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people. First  there's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the Indus script does not represent a language at all. These people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on shields. There's a second group of people who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo European language. If you look at a map of India today  you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo European language family. So some people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient Indo European language such as Sanskrit. There's a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today. These people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient form of the Dravidian language family  which is the language family spoken in much of South India today. And the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of Dravidian speaking people in the North  actually near Afghanistan  and they say that perhaps  sometime in the past  Dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian. Which of these hypotheses can be true  We don't know  but perhaps if you deciphered the script  you would be able to answer this question. But deciphering the script is a very challenging task. First  there's no Rosetta Stone. I don't mean the software  I mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text. We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script. And furthermore  we don't even know what language they spoke. And to make matters even worse  most of the text that we have are extremely short. So as I showed you  they're usually found on these seals that are very  very tiny. And so given these formidable obstacles  one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script. In the rest of my talk  I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the Indus script. I've always been fascinated by the Indus script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook. And why was I fascinated  Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world. My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist  so in my day job  I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions  how the brain makes decisions  how the brain learns and so on. But in       my path crossed again with the Indus script. That's when I was in India  and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script. And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists  and so I jumped at that opportunity. And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found. Or better yet  let's all collectively decipher. Are you ready  The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing. Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them. Can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right  I'll give you a couple of seconds. Okay. Right to left  how many  Okay. Okay. Left to right  Oh  it's almost      . Okay. The answer is  if you look at the left hand side of the two texts  you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs  and it seems like       years ago  when the scribe was writing from right to left  they ran out of space. And so they had to cram the sign. One of the signs is also below the text on the top. This suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left  and so that's one of the first things we know  that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts. And the Indus script now has this particular property. What other properties of language does the script show  Languages contain patterns. If I give you the letter Q and ask you to predict the next letter  what do you think that would be  Most of you said U  which is right. Now if I asked you to predict one more letter  what do you think that would be  Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A  but certainly not B  C or D  right  The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns. There's a lot of text that start with this diamond shaped symbol. And this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks like symbol. And this is very similar to a Q and U example. This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish like symbols and some other signs  but never by these other signs at the bottom. And furthermore  there's some signs that really prefer the end of texts  such as this jar shaped sign  and this sign  in fact  happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script. Given such patterns  here was our idea. The idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns  and so we gave the computer the existing texts. And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other. Given the computer model  we can test the model by essentially quizzing it. So we could deliberately erase some symbols  and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols. Here are some examples. You may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of Wheel of Fortune. What we found was that the computer was successful in    percent of the cases in predicting the correct symbol. In the rest of the cases  typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer. There's also practical use for this particular procedure. There's a lot of these texts that are damaged. Here's an example of one such text. And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction. Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted. And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze. Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model. So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard. I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this. Such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy. This is a physics and information theory term. But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters. How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard  You might have encountered the stuck key problem    so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again. This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all. Language  on the other hand  has an intermediate level of entropy  it's neither too rigid  nor is it too random. What about the Indus script  Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences. At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence  which is a random jumble of letters    and interestingly  we also find the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music. And both of these are very  very flexible  which is why you find them in the very high range. At the lower end of the scale  you find a rigid sequence  a sequence of all A's  and you also find a computer program  in this case in the language Fortran  which obeys really strict rules. Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range. Now what about the Indus script  We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts. When this result was first published  it was highly controversial. There were people who raised a hue and cry  and these people were the ones who believed that the Indus script does not represent language. I even started to get some hate mail. My students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection. Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession  What does this result really show  It shows that the Indus script shares an important property of language. So  as the old saying goes  if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script  then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands. What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language  Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages. So for example  here's the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet. If you don't know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch  you'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns. Some things are not right  and you'll say these words are probably not English words. The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script. The computer found several texts    two of them are shown here    that have very unusual patterns. So for example the first text  there's a doubling of this jar shaped sign. This sign is the most frequently occurring sign in the Indus script  and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair. Why is that the case  We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found  and it turns out that they were found very  very far away from the Indus Valley. They were found in present day Iraq and Iran. And why were they found there  What I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very  very enterprising. They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived  and so in this case  they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia  present day Iraq. And what seems to have happened here is that the Indus traders  the merchants  were using this script to write a foreign language. It's just like our English and Dutch example. And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley. This suggests that the same script  the Indus script  could be used to write different languages. The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language. If it does represent language  then how do we read the symbols  That's our next big challenge. So you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans  of insects  of fishes  of birds. Most ancient scripts use the rebus principle  which is  using pictures to represent words. So as an example  here's a word. Can you write it using pictures  I'll give you a couple seconds. Got it  Okay. Great. Here's my solution. You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf    and that's  belief   right. There could be other solutions. In the case of the Indus script  the problem is the reverse. You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense. So this is just like a crossword puzzle  except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it. My colleagues  Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola  have been making some headway on this particular problem. And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work. Here's a really short text. It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish like sign. And I want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods  so it's quite likely that these tags  at least some of them  contain names of merchants. And it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth. In Dravidian languages  the word for fish is  meen  which happens to sound just like the word for star. And so seven stars would stand for  elu meen   which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation. Similarly  there's another sequence of six stars  and that translates to  aru meen   which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades. And finally  there's other combinations  such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it. And that could be translated into  mey meen   which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn. So that was pretty exciting. It looks like we're getting somewhere. But does this prove that these seals contain Dravidian names based on planets and star constellations  Well not yet. So we have no way of validating these particular readings  but if more and more of these readings start making sense  and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct  then we know that we are on the right track. Today  we can write a word such as TED in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script  because both of these were deciphered in the   th century. The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly. The Mayans started speaking to us in the   th century  but the Indus civilization remains silent. Why should we care  The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis  it belongs to all of us. These are our ancestors    yours and mine. They were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history. If we decipher the script  we would enable them to speak to us again. What would they tell us  What would we find out about them  About us  I can't wait to find out. Thank you. It's an amazing thing that we're here to talk about the year of patients rising. You heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases  patients who are saying   You know what  I know what the odds are  but I'm going to go look for more information. I'm going to define what the terms of my success are.  I'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago I almost died    found out I was  in fact  already almost dead. And what I then found out about what's called the e Patient movement    I'll explain what that term means. I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave  and when I discovered this  I just renamed myself e Patient Dave. Regarding the word  patient   when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer  I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who's not in the room here  somebody out there. Some of our talks today  we still act like that. But I'm here to tell you   patient  is not a third person word. You  yourself  will find yourself in a hospital bed    or your mother  your child    there are heads nodding  people who say   Yes  I know exactly what you mean.  So when you hear what I'm going to talk about here today  first of all  I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met  all the ones I haven't met. This is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care  in fixing health care. One of the senior doctors at my hospital  Charlie Safran  and his colleague  Warner Slack  have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient. They have been saying that since the     s. Now I'm going to step back in history. This is from July      . I was a freshman in college  and this was when we first landed on the Moon. And it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface    that's the place where you and I are right now  where we live. The world was changing. It was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee. A few weeks later  Woodstock happened. Three days of fun and music. Here  just for historical authenticity  is a picture of me in that year. Yeah  the wavy hair  the blue eyes    it was really something. That Fall of       the Whole Earth Catalog came out. It was a hippie journal of self sufficiency. We think of hippies of being just hedonists  but there's a very strong component    I was in that movement    a very strong component of being responsible for yourself. This book's title's subtitle is   Access to Tools.  And it talked about how to build your own house  how to grow your own food  all kinds of things. In the     s  this young doctor  Tom Ferguson  was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog. And he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves. In fact  he said it was    to    percent of how we actually take care of our bodies. Well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease  the key thing that holds us back is access to information. And when the Web came along  that changed everything  because not only could we find information  we could find other people like ourselves who could gather  who could bring us information. And he coined this term e Patients    equipped  engaged  empowered  enabled. Obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then. Now I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term. In       I went to my doctor for a regular physical  and I had said   I have a sore shoulder.  Well  I got an X ray  and the next morning    you may have noticed  those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this. This morning  some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition. For me  it was      AM on January        . I was at the office  my desk was clean  I had the blue partition carpet on the walls. The phone rang and it was my doctor. He said   Dave  I pulled up the X ray image on the screen on the computer at home.  He said   Your shoulder's going to be fine  but Dave  there's something in your lung.  And if you look in that red oval  that shadow was not supposed to be there. To make a long story short  I said   So you need me to get back in there   He said   Yeah  we're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest.  And in parting I said   Is there anything I should do   He said    think about this one. This is the advice your doctor gives you   just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife.  I went in for the CAT scan  and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs. So at that point we knew that it was cancer. We knew it wasn't lung cancer. That meant it was metastasized from somewhere. The question was  where from  So I went in for an ultrasound. I got to do what many women have    the jelly on the belly and bzzzz. My wife came with me. She's a veterinarian  so she's seen lots of ultrasounds. I mean  she knows I'm not a dog. But what we saw    this is an MRI image. This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be. What we saw in that kidney was that big blob there. And there were actually two of these. One was growing out the front and it had already erupted  and it latched onto the bowel. One was growing out the back  and it attached to the soleus muscle  which is a big muscle in the back that I'd never heard of  but all of a sudden I cared about it. I went home. Now I've been Googling    I've been online since      on CompuServe. I went home  and I know you can't read the details here  that's not important. My point is I went to a respected medical website  WebMD  because I know how to filter out junk. I also found my wife online. Before I met her  I went through some suboptimal search results. So I looked for quality information. There's so much about trust    what sources of information can we trust  Where does my body end and an invader start  And cancer  a tumor  is something you grow out of your own tissue. How does that happen  Where does medical ability end and start  Well  so what I read on WebMD   The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer. Almost all patients are incurable.  I've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get  I go look for more. And what I found was on other websites  even by the third page of Google results   Outlook is bleak    Prognosis is grim.  And I'm thinking   What the heck   I didn't feel sick at all. I mean  I'd been getting tired in the evening  but I was    years old. I was slowly losing weight  but for me  that was what the doctor told me to do. It was really something. And this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug I eventually got. Totally by coincidence  there's that thing in my lung. In the left femur  the left thigh bone  there's another one. I had one. My leg eventually snapped. I fainted and landed on it  and it broke. There's one in the skull  and then just for good measure  I had these other tumors    including  by the time my treatment started  one was growing out of my tongue. I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue. And what I read was that my median survival was    weeks. This was bad. I was facing the grave. I thought   What's my mother's face going to look like on the day of my funeral   I had to sit down with my daughter and say   Here's the situation.  Her boyfriend was with her. I said   I don't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while Dad's still alive.  It's really serious. Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help  think about this. Well  my doctor prescribed a patient community  Acor.org  a network of cancer patients  of all amazing things. Very quickly they told me   Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease. Get yourself to a specialist center. There is no cure  but there's something that sometimes works    it usually doesn't    called high dosage interleukin. Most hospitals don't offer it  so they won't even tell you it exists. And don't let them give you anything else first. And by the way  here are four doctors in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers.  How amazing is that  Here's the thing. Here we are  four years later  you can't find a website that gives patients that information. Government approved  American Cancer Society  but patients know what patients want to know. It's the power of patient networks. This amazing substance    again I mentioned  where does my body end  My oncologist and I talk a lot these days because I try to keep my talks technically accurate. And he said   You know  the immune system is good at detecting invaders    bacteria coming from outside    but when it's your own tissue that you've grown  it's a whole different thing.  And I went through a mental exercise actually  because I started a patient support community of my own on a website  and one of my friends  one of my relatives actually  said   Look  Dave  who grew this thing  Are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself   So we went into it. And the story of how all that happens is in this book. Anyway  this is the way the numbers unfolded. Me being me  I put the numbers from my hospital's website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet. Don't worry about the numbers. You see  that's the immune system. Amazing thing  those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart. And look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between. Just incredible. Who knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it. The punch line is that a year and a half later  I was there when this magnificent young woman  my daughter  got married. And when she came down those steps  and it was just her and me for that moment  I was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother   I wish Dad could have been here.  And this is what we're doing when we make health care better. Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care. This is Regina Holliday  a painter in Washington D.C.  whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease. She's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital. One of the things that she discovered was that her husband's medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized. And she thought   You know  if I have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box  why can't there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty  every new doctor  the basics about my husband's condition   So she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label  something like that  in a diagram of him. She then  last year  painted this diagram. She studied health care like me. She came to realize that there were a lot of people who'd written patient advocate books that you just don't hear about at medical conferences. Patients are such an underutilized resource. Well as it says in my introduction  I've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data. And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago   Give me my damn data  because you people can't be trusted to keep it clean.  And here she has our damned data    it's a pun    which is starting to break out  starting to break through    the water symbolizes our data. And in fact  I want to do a little something improvisational for you here. There's a guy on Twitter that I know  a health IT guy outside Boston  and he wrote the e Patient rap. And it goes like this.   Gimme my damn data     I want to be an e Patient just like Dave     Gimme my damn data  cuz it's my life to save   Now I'm not going to go any further. Well thank you. That shot the timing. Think about the possibility  why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family  Here's a website  VisibleBody.com  that I stumbled across. And I thought   You know  I wonder what my soleus muscle is   So you can click on things and remove it. And I saw   Aha  that's the kidney and the soleus muscle.  And I was rotating it in  D and saying   I understand now.  And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth  where you can fly to any address. And I thought   Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body   What did Google come out with this year  Now there's Google Body browser. But you see  it's still generic. It's not my data. But if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it  the way software innovators like to do  who knows what we'll be able to come up with. One final story  this is Kelly Young  a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida. This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks. RA patients  as they call themselves    her blog is RA Warrior    have a big problem because    percent of them have no visible symptoms. And that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going. And some doctors think   Yeah right  you're really in pain.  Well she found  through her online research  a nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer  but it can also reveal inflammation. And she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray. So she took it. And the radiologist report said   No cancer found.  Well that's not what he was supposed to do with it. So she had it read again  she wanted to have it read again  and her doctor fired her. She pulled up the CD. He said   If you don't want to follow my instructions  go away.  So she pulled up the CD of the scan images  and look at all those hot spots. And she's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care. See  that is an empowered patient    no medical training. We are  you are  the most underused resource in health care. What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data. How big a deal was this  Well at TED      Tim Berners Lee himself  inventor of the Web  gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser go out and find other people's articles about the data  but the raw data. And he got them chanting by the end of the talk   Raw data now. Raw data now.  And I ask you  three words  please  to improve health care  let patients help. Let patients help. Let patients help. Let patients help. Thank you. For all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast  God bless you  everyone    let patients help. Host  And bless yourself. Thank you very much. The Highline is an old  elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan. And it was originally a freight line that ran down   th Ave. And it became known as  Death Avenue  because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front  and he became known as the  West Side Cowboy.  But even with a cowboy  about one person a month was killed and run over. So they elevated it. They built it    ft. in the air  right through the middle of the city. But with the rise of interstate trucking  it was used less and less. And by       the last train rode. It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys    they say  at Thanksgiving    from the meatpacking district. And then it was abandoned. And I live in the neighborhood  and I first read about it in the New York Times  in an article that said it was going to be demolished. And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer  but I realized no one was doing anything. I went to my first community board meeting    which I'd never been to one before    and sat next to another guy named Joshua David  who's a travel writer. And at the end of the meeting  we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project  most people wanted to tear it down. So we exchanged business cards  and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization  Friends of the High Line. And the goal at first was just saving it from demolition  but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it. And what first attracted me  or interested me  was this view from the street    which is this steel structure  sort of rusty  this industrial relic. But when I went up on top  it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River. And that's really where we started  the idea coalesced around  let's make this a park  and let's have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape. At the time  there was a lot of opposition. Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down. I'm going to fast forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement. Mayor Bloomberg came in office  he was very supportive  but we still had to make the economic case. This was after       the city was in tough times. So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case. And it turns out  we got those numbers wrong. We thought it would cost     million dollars to build. So far it's cost about     million. And the main case was  this is going to make good economic sense for the city. So we said over a    year time period  the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about     million. That was enough. It really got the city behind it. It turns out we were wrong on that. Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars  or will create about a half a billion dollars  in tax revenues for the city. We did a design competition  selected a design team. We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape. There's three sections. We opened the fist section in     . It's been successful beyond our dreams. Last year we had about two million people  which is about    times what we ever estimated. This is one of my favorite features in section one. It's this amphitheater right over   th Ave. And the first section ends at   th St. right now. The other thing  it's generated  obviously  a lot of economic value  it's also inspired  I think  a lot of great architecture. There's a point  you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry  Jean Nouvel  Shigeru Ban  Neil Denari. And the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line. And this has been designed by Renzo Piano. And they're going to break ground in May. And we've already started construction on section two. This is one of my favorite features  this flyover where you're eight feet off the surface of the High Line  running through a canopy of trees. The High Line used to be covered in billboards  and so we've taken a playful take where  instead of framing advertisements  it's going to frame people in views of the city. This was just installed last month. And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards  which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan. And the city has planned    for better or for worse       million square feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around. But what really  I think  makes the High Line special is the people. And honestly  even though I love the designs that we were building  I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it  because I fell in love with that wildscape    and how could you recreate that magic  But what I found is it's in the people and how they use it that  to me  makes it so special. Just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line. And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands  we just don't do that outside. But you see that happening on the High Line  and I think that's the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other. Thanks.
