I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it  and that is all of us are makers. I really believe that. All of us are makers. We're born makers. We have this ability to make things  to grasp things with our hands. We use words like  grasp  metaphorically to also think about understanding things. We don't just live  but we make. We create things. Well I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places. It doesn't come out particularly well  but that's a particularly tall bicycle. It's a scraper bike  it's called    from Oakland. And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. But he's trying to power it  or motorize it  with a drill. And the question he had is   Can I do it  Can it be done   Apparently it can. So makers are enthusiasts  they're amateurs  they're people who love doing what they do. They don't always even know why they're doing it. We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire. There was one held in Detroit here last summer  and it will be held again next summer  at the Henry Ford. But we hold them in San Francisco       and in New York. And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation. Dale Dougherty  These are electric muffins. Guy  Where did you guys get those  Muffin  Will you glide with us   Guy  No.  DD  I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out. We got there first. Lady  Will you glide with us  DD  This is something I call  swinging in the rain.  And you can barely see it  but it's    a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc. So imagine a kid   Am I going to get wet  Am I going to get wet  No  I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet  Am I going to get wet   That's the experience of a clever ride. And of course  we have fashion. People are remaking things into fashion. I don't know if this is called a basket bra  but it ought to be something like that. We have art students getting together  taking old radiator parts and doing an iron pour to make something new out of it. They did that in the summer  and it was very warm. Now this one takes a little bit of explaining. You know what those are  right  Billy Bob  or Billy Bass  or something like that. Now the background is    the guy who did this is a physicist. And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does. and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. Choir    When you hold me in your arms   DD  This is all computer controlled in an old Volvo. Choir    I'm hooked on a feelin'     I'm high on believin'     That you're in love with me   DD  So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. So  are you a maker  How many people here would say you're a maker  if you raise your hand  That's a pretty good    but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers. And again  think about it. You're makers of food  you're makers of shelter  you're makers of lots of different things  and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world  and particularly the role that technology has in your life. You're really a driver or a passenger    to use a Volkswagen phrase. Makers are in control. That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do. They want to figure out how things work  they want to get access to it  and they want to control it. They want to use it to their own purpose. Makers today  to some degree  are out on the edge. They're not mainstream. They're a little bit radical. They're a bit subversive in what they do. But at one time  it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker. It was not something you'd even remark upon. And I found this old video. And I'll tell you more about it  but just ... we are makers. With our strengths and our minds and spirit  we gather  we form  and we fashion. Makers and shapers and put it togetherers. DD  So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood  a grandfather making a ship in a bottle  a woman making a pie    somewhat standard fare of the day. But it was a sense of pride that we made things  that the world around us was made by us. It didn't just exist. We made it  and we were connected to it that way. And I think that's tremendously important. Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this. This particular reel    it's an industrial video    but it was shown in drive in theaters in         in the Detroit area  in fact    and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's  Psycho.  So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this  plus  Psycho.  This is Andrew Archer. I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth  Minnesota. And I talked to his mom  and I ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called Kidrobot. He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. He liked to take things apart. His mother gave him a part of the garage  and he collected things from yard sales  and he made stuff. And then he didn't particularly like school that much  but he got involved in robotics competitions  and he realized he had a talent  and  more importantly  he had a real passion for it. And he began building robots. And when I sat down next to him  he was telling me about a company he formed  and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor. And that's why he moved to Michigan. But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing. And this kind of gets to this important idea today. This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hackerspace. And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit. And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last. But these are like clubs    they're sharing tools  sharing space  sharing expertise in what to make. And so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world. But essentially these are people that are playing with technology. Let me say that again  playing. They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it. They're playing to discover what the technology can do  and probably to discover what they can do themselves  what their own capabilities are. Now the other thing that I think is taking off  another reason making is taking off today  is there's some great new tools out there. And you can't see this very well on the screen  but Arduino    Arduino is an open source hardware platform. It's a micro controller. If you don't know what those are  they're just the  brains.  So they're the brains of maker projects  and here's an example of one. And I don't know if you can see it that well  but that's a mailbox    so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. So you figure out how to program this  and you put this in your mailbox. And when someone opens your mailbox  you get a notification  an alert message goes to your iPhone. Now that could be a dog door  it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't  like a little brother into a little sister's room. There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that. Now here's something    a  D printer. That's another tool that's really taken off    really  really interesting. This is Makerbot. And there are industrial versions of this    about        dollars. These guys came up with a kit version for     dollars  and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with  D printers. Now they don't know what they want to do with it  but they're going to figure it out. They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it. One of the coolest things is  Makerbot sent out an upgrade  some new brackets for the box. Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones. Isn't that cool  So makers harvest technology from all the places around us. This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy. And they do interesting things. They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think    the military is doing drones    well  there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes  or vehicles    something that you could program to fly on its own  without a stick or anything  to figure out what path it's going. Fascinating work they're doing. We just had an issue on space exploration  DIY space exploration. This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space. You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like       dollars. Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space. In fact  these guys actually work for NASA  and they're trying to pioneer using off the shelf components  cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space. Makers are a source of innovation  and I think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry. This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers  It's the Homebrew Computer Club    just like a hackerspace. And he says   I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free.  Well he did a little bit better than free. But it's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries    even like Henry Ford    come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups. Well  if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker  I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers  that kids are particularly interested in this  in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro controllers and build robots. And we've got to get this into schools  or into communities in many  many ways    the ability to tinker  to shape and reshape the world around us. There's a great opportunity today    and that's what I really care about the most. An the answer to the question  what will America make  It's more makers. Thank you very much. I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy  social media and the end of gender. Let me connect the dots. I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love  or love to hate  are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender. If you hadn't noticed  our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender  and I think that's going to change. Now most media companies    television  radio  publishing  games  you name it    they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences. It's old school demographics. They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us. Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways    you have certain taste  that you like certain things. And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics. Age demographics  the    to    demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the     s  when the baby boomers were still young. Now they've aged out of that demographic  but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age   . In our media environment  it's as if they don't even exist. Now  if you watch  Mad Men   like I do    it's a popular TV show in the States    Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics  which first came about in the     s  where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers. But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. It's really just been basic demographics. So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC  and we've done a lot of research over the last seven  eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. And in the last three years  we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed  and we've discovered some very interesting things. All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. But those categories mean even less now than they did before  because with online networking tools  it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes. We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. And we can lie about our age online  too  pretty easily. We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests. We don't need a media company to help do this for us. So the traditional media companies  of course  are paying very close attention to these online communities. They know this is the mass audience of the future  they need to figure it out. But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them  because that's how ad rates are still determined. When they're monitoring your clickstream    and you know they are    they have a really hard time figuring out your age  your gender and your income. They can make some educated guesses. But they get a lot more information about what you do online  what you like  what interests you. That's easier for them to find out than who you are. And even though that's still sort of creepy  there is an upside to having your taste monitored. Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. It had been presumed before. So when you look online at the way people aggregate  they don't aggregate around age  gender and income. They aggregate around the things they love  the things that they like  and if you think about it  shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories. I'd much rather know whether you like  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  rather than how old you are. That would tell me something more substantial about you. Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. If you look at the statistics    these are worldwide statistics    in every single age category  women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites  they truly dominate the social media space  which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media. The question is  what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture  and what's it going to mean for women  If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media  then does that mean that women are going to take over global media  Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows  Will the next big budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks  Could this be possible  that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape  Well  I actually don't think that's going to be the case. I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women  because they realize this is important for their business  and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere. But I think women are actually going to be    ironically enough    responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the  chick flick  and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things    that Hispanics like certain things  that young people like certain things. This is far too simplistic. The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data driven  and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online  where women are really driving the action. So you may be asking  well why is it important that I know what entertains people  Why should I know this  Of course  old media companies and advertisers need to know this. But my argument is that  if you want to understand the global village  it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about  what amuses them  what they choose to do in their free time. This is a very important thing to know about people. I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. And I do it not just because it's fun    though actually  it is really fun    but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives    for instance  on their political beliefs and on their health. And so  if you have any interest in understanding the world  looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start. So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. Can you even imagine what that looks like  I can't wait to find out what it looks like. Thank you so much. Running    it's basically just right  left  right  left    yeah  I mean  we've been doing it for two million years  so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. But the cool thing about running  as I've discovered  is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time. Case in point  A couple months ago  if you saw the New York City Marathon  I guarantee you  you saw something that no one has ever seen before. An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line. She's    years old  she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years  and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth. Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport  but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event  the New York City Marathon. Except    bad news for Derartu Tulu    some other people had the same idea  including the Olympic gold medalist and Paula Radcliffe  who is a monster  the fastest woman marathoner in history by far. Only    minutes off the men's world record  Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable. That's her competition. The gun goes off  and she's not even an underdog. She's under the underdogs. But the under underdog hangs tough  and    miles into a    mile race  there is Derartu Tulu up there with the lead pack. Now this is when something really bizarre happens. Paula Radcliffe  the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of Derartu Tulu's under underdog hands  suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back. So we all know what to do in this situation  right  You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line. Derartu Tulu ruins the script. Instead of taking off  she falls back  and she grabs Paula Radcliffe  says   Come on. Come with us. You can do it.  So Paula Radcliffe  unfortunately  does it. She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line. But then she falls back again. And the second time Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her. And Paula Radcliffe at that point says   I'm done. Go.  So that's a fantastic story  and we all know how it ends. She loses the check  but she goes home with something bigger and more important. Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again    instead of losing  she blazes past the lead pack and wins  wins the New York City Marathon  goes home with a big fat check. It's a heartwarming story  but if you drill a little bit deeper  you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there. When you have two outliers in one organism  it's not a coincidence. When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race  again  it's not a coincidence. You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills  somehow water's involved. Someone with that kind of heart  there's some kind of connection there. And the answer to it  I think  can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico  where there's a tribe  a reclusive tribe  called the Tarahumara Indians. Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. Number one is  they have been living essentially unchanged for the past     years. When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices  you either fight back and engage or you could take off. The Mayans and Aztecs engaged  which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs. The Tarahumara had a different strategy. They took off and hid in this labyrinthine  networking  spiderwebbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons  and there they remained since the     s    essentially the same way they've always been. The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is  deep into old age       to    years old    these guys aren't running marathons  they're running mega marathons. They're not doing    miles  they're doing          miles at a time  and apparently without injury  without problems. The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is that all the things that we're going to be talking about today  all the things that we're trying to come up with using all of our technology and brain power to solve    things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression    all this stuff  the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about. They are free from all of these modern ailments. So what's the connection  Again  we're talking about outliers    there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there. Well  there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries. And once again  a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery    perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries  which go like this  three things    if you have the answer  come up and take the microphone  because nobody else knows the answer. And if you know it  then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth. Mystery number one is this  Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size. Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain. Suddenly humans show up    Homo erectus    big  old melon head. To have a brain of that size  you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy. In other words  early humans are eating dead animals    no argument  that's a fact. The only problem is  the first edged weapons only appeared about         years ago. So  somehow  for nearly two million years  we are killing animals without any weapons. Now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle. Every other animal is stronger than we are    they have fangs  they have claws  they have nimbleness  they have speed. We think Usain Bolt is fast. Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel. We're not fast. That would be an Olympic event  turn a squirrel loose    whoever catches the squirrel  you get a gold medal. So no weapons  no speed  no strength  no fangs  no claws    how were we killing these animals  Mystery number one. Mystery number two  Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now  but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters    they all suck  they're terrible. There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been. The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in     . I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than     . For some reason you guys are just really slow. But you get to the marathon we were just talking about    you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for    years. Because  prior to the     s  medical science said that if a woman tried to run    miles    does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run    miles  why you were banned from the marathon before the     s  Yes. You would have torn reproductive organs. The uterus would fall out  literally fall out of the body. Now I've been to a lot of marathons  and I've yet to see any ... So it's only been    years that women have been allowed to run the marathon. In that very short learning curve  you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only    minutes off the male world record. Then you go beyond    miles  into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans    remember Pheidippides died when he ran    miles    you get to    and     miles  and suddenly it's a different game. You can take a runner like Ann Trason  or Nikki Kimball  or Jenn Shelton  you put them in a race of    or     miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who's going to win. I'll give you an example. A couple years ago  Emily Baer signed up for a race called the Hardrock      which tells you all you need to know about the race. They give you    hours to finish this race. Well Emily Baer        runners    she finishes in eighth place  in the top     even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race    and yet  beat     other people. So why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer  The third mystery is this  At the University of Utah  they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon. And what they found is that  if you start running the marathon at age     you will get progressively faster  year by year  until you reach your peak at age   . And then after that  you succumb to the rigors of time. And you'll get slower and slower  until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age   . So about seven years  eight years to reach your peak  and then gradually you fall off your peak  until you go back to the starting point. You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed  maybe    years    no  it's    years.    year old men and women are running as fast as they were at age   . Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity    and please don't say golf    something that actually is hard    where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers. So you have these three mysteries. Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up  You've got to be really careful any time someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer  because  it being prehistory  you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it. But I'll submit this to you  If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle  suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture. If you wonder  why it is the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease  why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive  and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons  perhaps it's because humans  as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe  actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs. Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal. Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness    again  it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed    the only thing we do really  really well is sweat. We're really good at being sweaty and smelly. Better than any other mammal on Earth  we can sweat really well. But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that  when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances  we're superb  we're the best on the planet. You take a horse on a hot day  and after about five or six miles  that horse has a choice. It's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off  but it ain't doing both    we can. So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals  What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group  go out there on that African Savannah  pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death  That's all we could do. We could run really far on a hot day. Well if that's true  a couple other things had to be true as well. The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word  pack.  If you go out by yourself  and you try to chase an antelope  I guarantee you there's going to be two cadavers out there in the Savannah. You need a pack to pull together. You need to have those         year olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're actually trying to catch. The herd explodes and it gathers back again. Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack. They can't be    miles behind. You need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent. It makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead and the people who want to eat it    miles away. They need to be part of the pack. You need to have those    year old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill  and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved. The pack stays together. Another thing that has to be true about this pack  this pack cannot be really materialistic. You can't be hauling all your crap around  trying to chase the antelope. You can't be a pissed off pack. You can't be bearing grudges  like   I'm not chasing that guy's antelope. He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope.  The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego  be cooperative and pull together. What you end up with  in other words  is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara    a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age. It's a really compelling argument that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years  that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path. You know  we look at running as this kind of alien  foreign thing  this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. But maybe it's something different. Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it. How do we spoil it  Well how do we spoil anything  We try to cash in on it. We try to can it and package it and make it  better  and sell it to people. And what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things  which can make running  better   called running shoes. The reason I get personally pissed off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt. And I think that  if anybody in here runs    and I just had a conversation with Carol  we talked for two minutes backstage  and she's talking about plantar fasciitis. You talk to a runner  I guarantee  within    seconds  the conversation turns to injury. So if humans evolved as runners  if that's our one natural advantage  why are we so bad at it  Why do we keep getting hurt  Curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time. If you read folklore and mythology  any kind of myths  any kind of tall tales  running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor. It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain. Geronimo used to say that   My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs.  That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run    miles across the desert  engage in hand to hand combat  steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home. Geronimo was never saying   Ah  you know something  my achilles    I'm tapering. I got to take this week off   or  I need to cross train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready.  Humans ran and ran all the time. We are here today. We have our digital technology. All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day  which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances. So how do we get back to that again  Well  I would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging  all the sales  all the marketing. Get rid of all the stinking running shoes. Stop focusing on urban marathons  which  if you do four hours  you suck. If you do          you're awesome  because you qualified for another race. We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and  I would say  nakedness  that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time. So what's the benefit  So what  So you burn off the Haagen Dazs from the night before  But maybe there's another benefit there as well. Without getting a little too extreme about this  imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed  more serene  more healthy  burn off stress    where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore  where you don't go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again. Maybe there's something between what we are today and what the Tarahumara have always been. I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize  which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet  but maybe there's somewhere in between. And if we find that thing  maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there. Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence  up until the     s or so  the benefits  social and physical and political and mental  could be astounding. So what I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners  people who got rid of their shoes. And what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes  you get rid of the stress  you get rid of the injuries and the ailments. And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time  that this can be a whole lot of fun. I've experienced it personally myself. I was injured all my life  and then in my early   s I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too. So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from. And I appreciate you guys listening to this story. Thanks very much.  What I Will  I will not dance to your war drum. I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum. I will not dance to that beating. I know that beat. It is lifeless. I know intimately that skin you are hitting. It was alive once  hunted  stolen  stretched. I will not dance to your drummed up war. I will not pop  spin  break for you. I will not hate for you or even hate you. I will not kill for you. Especially I will not die for you. I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide. I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. Everyone can be wrong. Life is a right  not collateral or casual. I will not forget where I come from. I will craft my own drum. Gather my beloved near  and our chanting will be dancing. Our humming will be drumming. I will not be played. I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat. I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance. This heartbeat is louder than death. Your war drum ain't louder than this breath. Haaa. What's up TED people  Let me hear you make some noise. A bunch of pacifists. Confused  aspiring pacifists. I understand. I've been wrong a lot lately. Like a lot. So I couldn't figure out what to read today. I mean  I've been saying I've been prepping. What that means is prepping my outfit  prepping options  trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. Poetry does that. It preps you. It aims you. So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. But I'm going to need you to just sit for like    minutes and hold a woman who is not here. Hold her now with you. You don't need to say her name out loud  you can just hold her. Are you holding her  This is  Break Clustered.  All holy history banned. Unwritten books predicted the future  projected the past. But my head unwraps around what appears limitless  man's creative violence. Whose son shall it be  Which male child will perish a new day  Our boys' deaths galvanize. We cherish corpses. We mourn women  complicated. Bitches get beat daily. Profits made  prophets ignored. War and tooth  enameled salted lemon childhoods. All colors run  none of us solid. Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within. I live cycles of light and darkness. Rhythm is half silence. I see now  I never was one and not the other. Sickness  health  tender violence. I think now I never was pure. Before form I was storm  blind  ign'ant    still am. Human contracted itself blind  malignant. I never was pure. Girl spoiled before ripened. Language can't math me. I experience exponentially. Everything is everything. One woman loses     maybe     members of her family. One woman loses six. One woman loses her head. One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash. One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. One woman straps herself. One woman gives birth to a baby. One woman gives birth to borders. One woman no longer believes love will ever find her. One woman never did. Where do refugee hearts go  Broken  dissed  placed where they're not from  don't want to be missed. Faced with absence. We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all. My spine curves spiral. Precipice running to and running from human beings. Cluster bombs left behind. De facto landmines. A smoldering grief. Harvest contaminated tobacco. Harvest bombs. Harvest baby teeth. Harvest palms  smoke. Harvest witness  smoke. Resolutions  smoke. Salvation  smoke. Redemption  smoke. Breathe. Do not fear what has blown up. If you must  fear the unexploded. Thank you. What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request. I'd like all of you to pause for a moment  you wretched weaklings  and take stock of your miserable existence. Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century. It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned   . Up until that moment  I had been that classic corporate warrior    I was eating too much  I was drinking too much  I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family. And I decided that I would try and turn my life around. In particular  I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work life balance. So I stepped back from the workforce  and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children. But all I learned about work life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work. Not a very useful skill  especially when the money runs out. So I went back to work  and I've spent these seven years since struggling with  studying and writing about work life balance. And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today. The first is  if society's to make any progress on this issue  we need an honest debate. But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work life balance. All the discussions about flexi time or dress down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue  which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day to day basis with a young family. Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in. And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet  screaming desperation  where they work long  hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like. It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and  a  T shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue. The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us. We should stop looking outside. It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead. If you don't design your life  someone else will design it for you  and you may just not like their idea of balance. It's particularly important    this isn't on the World Wide Web  is it  I'm about to get fired    it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies    the  abattoirs of the human soul   as I call them. I'm talking about all companies. Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you  as  they can get away with. It's in their nature  it's in their DNA  it's what they do    even the good  well intentioned companies. On the one hand  putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened. On the other hand  it's a nightmare    it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life. The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance. Before I went back to work after my year at home  I sat down and I wrote out a detailed  step by step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to. And it went like this  wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have breakfast with my wife and children. Have sex again. Drive the kids to school on the way to the office. Do three hours' work. Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime. Do another three hours' work. Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink. Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids. Meditate for half an hour. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have sex again. Go to bed. How often do you think I have that day  We need to be realistic. You can't do it all in one day. We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life  but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the  I'll have a life when I retire  when my kids have left home  when my wife has divorced me  my health is failing  I've got no mates or interests left.  A day is too short   after I retire  is too long. There's got to be a middle way. A fourth observation  We need to approach balance in a balanced way. A friend came to see me last year    and she doesn't mind me telling this story    a friend came to see me last year and said   Nigel  I've read your book. And I realize that my life is completely out of balance. It's totally dominated by work. I work    hours a day  I commute two hours a day. All of my relationships have failed. There's nothing in my life apart from my work. So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out. So I joined a gym.  Now I don't mean to mock  but being a fit    hour a day office rat isn't more balanced  it's more fit. Lovely though physical exercise may be  there are other parts to life    there's the intellectual side  there's the emotional side  there's the spiritual side. And to be balanced  I believe we have to attend to all of those areas    not just do    stomach crunches. Now that can be daunting. Because people say   Bloody hell mate  I haven't got time to get fit. You want me to go to church and call my mother.  And I understand. I truly understand how that can be daunting. But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective. My wife  who is somewhere in the audience today  called me up at the office and said   Nigel  you need to pick our youngest son     Harry     up from school.  Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening. So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. We walked down to the local park  messed around on the swings  played some silly games. I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe  and we shared a pizza for two  then walked down the hill to our home  and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas. I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's  James and the Giant Peach.  I then put him to bed  tucked him in  gave him a kiss on his forehead and said   Goodnight  mate   and walked out of his bedroom. As I was walking out of his bedroom  he said   Dad   I went   Yes  mate   He went   Dad  this has been the best day of my life  ever.  I hadn't done anything  hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation. Now my point is the small things matter. Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life. With the smallest investment in the right places  you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life. Moreover  I think  it can transform society. Because if enough people do it  we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins  to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. And that  I think  is an idea worth spreading. Ever since I was a little girl seeing  Star Wars  for the first time  I've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots. And as a little girl  I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful  trusted sidekick    something that would delight us  enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. I knew robots like that didn't really exist  but I knew I wanted to build them. So    years pass    I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence  the year is       and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. But robots are still not in our home  ironically. And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case. But one really struck me. Robotics had really been about interacting with things  not with people    certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. For me  that was the white space  that's what robots could not do yet. And so that year  I started to build this robot  Kismet  the world's first social robot. Three years later    a lot of programming  working with other graduate students in the lab    Kismet was ready to start interacting with people. Kismet   Nonsense  Scientist  This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Kismet   Nonsense  Scientist  Yeah  look  it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. Cynthia Breazeal  So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non verbal child or pre verbal child  which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind. It didn't speak language  but it didn't matter. This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us    and with that  the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots. So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots  now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students. And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo. This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo  introducing Leo to a new object. And because it's new  Leo doesn't really know what to make of it. But sort of like us  he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction. Leo  this is Cookie Monster. Can you find Cookie Monster  Leo  Cookie Monster is very bad. He's very bad  Leo. Cookie Monster is very  very bad. He's a scary monster. He wants to get your cookies. CB  All right  so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start  but they get along great now. So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology  where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. And with that shift in thinking  we can now start to imagine new questions  new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise. But what do I mean when I say  push our social buttons   Well  one of the things that we've learned is that  if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language  the same sort of non verbal cues that people use    like Nexi  our humanoid robot  is doing here    what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is  how likable  how engaging  how trustworthy. It turns out it's the same for robots. It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. To answer questions like  how is it that  from a brief encounter  we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is  Mimicry's believed to play a role  but how  Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters  It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically. We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. But with the robot  you can. And so in this video here    this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University. He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with. There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. And the bottom line is    the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. So given that key insight  we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots. For instance  if robots do respond to our non verbal cues  maybe they would be a cool  new communication technology. So imagine this  What about a robot accessory for your cellphone  You call your friend  she puts her handset in a robot  and  bam  You're a MeBot    you can make eye contact  you can talk with your friends  you can move around  you can gesture    maybe the next best thing to really being there  or is it  To explore this question  my student  Siggy Adalgeirsson  did a study where we brought human participants  people  into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table  discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task    this ended up being a survival task    and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants. The first was just the screen. This is just like video conferencing today. The next was to add mobility    so  have the screen on a mobile base. This is like  if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today    this is mirroring that situation. And then the fully expressive MeBot. So after the interaction  we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology  with a remote collaborator through this technology  in a number of different ways. We looked at psychological involvement    how much empathy did you feel for the other person  We looked at overall engagement. We looked at their desire to cooperate. And this is what we see when they use just the screen. It turns out  when you add mobility    the ability to roll around the table    you get a little more of a boost. And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression. So it seems like this physical  social embodiment actually really makes a difference. Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. Today we know that families are living further and further apart  and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. For me  I have three young boys  and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents. But my parents live thousands of miles away  so they just don't get to see each other that often. We try Skype  we try phone calls  but my boys are little    they don't really want to talk  they want to play. So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance play technology. I imagine a time not too far from now    my mom can go to her computer  open up a browser and jack into a little robot. And as grandma bot  she can now play  really play  with my sons  with her grandsons  in the real world with his real toys. I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social plays with their granddaughters  with their friends  and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house  like sharing a bedtime story. And through this technology  being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today. Let's think about some other domains  like maybe health. So in the United States today  over    percent of people are either overweight or obese  and now it's a big problem with our children as well. And we know that as you get older in life  if you're obese when you're younger  that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life  but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system. But if robots can be engaging  if we like to cooperate with robots  if robots are persuasive  maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program  maybe they can help you manage your weight. Sort of like a digital Jiminy    as in the well known fairy tale    a kind of friendly  supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. So we actually explored this idea in our lab. This is a robot  Autom. Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. And it was designed to be a robot diet and exercise coach. It had a couple of simple non verbal skills it could do. It could make eye contact with you. It could share information looking down at a screen. You'd use a screen interface to enter information  like how many calories you ate that day  how much exercise you got. And then it could help track that for you. And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth. And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. It could help you set goals and track your progress  and it would help motivate you. So an interesting question is  does the social embodiment really matter  Does it matter that it's a robot  Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters  To explore that question  we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks. One case was the robot you saw there  Autom. Another was a computer that ran the same touch screen interface  ran exactly the same dialogues. The quality of advice was identical. And the third was just a pen and paper log  because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet and exercise program. So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost  but really how long they interacted with the robot. Because the challenge is not losing weight  it's actually keeping it off. And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions  well that's indicative  potentially  of longer term success. So the first thing I want to look at is how long  how long did people interact with these systems. It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more  even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance  people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. And when you look at emotional engagement  it was completely different. People would name the robots. They would dress the robots. And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study  they would come out to the car and say good bye to the robots. They didn't do this with a computer. The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today  whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. My sons  they love the screen. They love the screen. But I want them to play  as a mom  I want them to play  like  real world play. And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child  where it can take on many of the properties of real world play. So here's the first exploration of this idea  where characters can be physical or virtual  and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended reality play. But we can push this idea further. What if    CB     the character itself could come into your world  It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world. And when it's in their world  they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities. So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world. So here  Nathan has changed the letter A to the number  . You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world. So they are now sending the character back into that world. And now it's got number power. And then finally  what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids  where they really feel like they are part of that story  a part of that experience. And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching  Star Wars.  But I want to do more than that. I actually want them to create those experiences. I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them. I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. I think that's very  very important. So this is a new project. We've invited a lot of kids into this space  and they think it's pretty cool. But I can tell you  the thing that they love the most is the robot. What they care about is the robot. Robots touch something deeply human within us. And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative  or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance  or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves  for me  robots are all about people. Thank you. Hawa Abdi  Many people       years for Somalia     were  fighting. So there was no job  no food. Children  most of them  became very malnourished  like this. Deqo Mohamed  So as you know  always in a civil war  the ones affected most  are  the women and children. So our patients are women and children. And they are in our backyard. It's our home. We welcome them. That's the camp that we have in now        people  where    percent of them are women and children. Pat Mitchell  And this is your hospital. This is the inside. HA  We are doing C sections and different operations because people need some help. There is no government to protect them. DM  Every morning we have about     patients  maybe more or less. But sometimes we are only five doctors and    nurses  and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them. But we take the severe ones  and we reschedule the other ones the next day. It is very tough. And as you can see  it's the women who are carrying the children  it's the women who come into the hospitals  it's the women  are  building the houses. That's their house. And we have a school. This is our bright    we opened  in the  last two years  an  elementary school where we have     children  and the majority are women and girls. PM  And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. Would you explain the rules for admission  HA  The people who are coming to us  we are welcoming. We are sharing with them whatever we have. But there are only two rules. First rule  there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society.  Whomever  makes those things we throw out. The second  no man can beat his wife. If he beat  we will put  him  in jail  and we will call the eldest people. Until they identify this case  we'll never release him. That's our two rules. The other thing that I have realized  that the woman is the most strong person all over the world. Because the last    years  the Somali woman has stood up. They were the leaders  and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations. We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. We can reconcile. We can do everything. DM  As my mother said  we are the future hope  and the men are only killing in Somalia. So we came up with these two rules. In a camp with        people  you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. So there is no clan division  and no man can beat his wife. And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail. So if you beat your wife  you're going to be there. So empowering the women and giving the opportunity    we are there for them. They are not alone for this. PM  You're running a medical clinic. It brought much  much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it. You're also running a civil society. You've created your own rules  in which women and children are getting a different sense of security. Talk to me about your decision  Dr. Abdi  and your decision  Dr. Mohamed  to work together    for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances. HA  My age    because I was born in         we were having  at that time  government  law and order. But one day  I went to the hospital    my mother was sick    and I saw the hospital  how they  were  treating the doctors  how they  are  committed to help the sick people. I admired them  and I decided to become a doctor. My mother died  unfortunately  when I was    years  old . Then my father allowed me to proceed  with  my hope. My mother died in  a  gynecology complication  so I decided to become a gynecology specialist. That's why I became a doctor. So Dr. Deqo has to explain. DM  For me  my mother was preparing  me  when I was a child to become a doctor  but I really didn't want to. Maybe I should become an historian  or maybe a reporter. I loved it  but it didn't work. When the war broke out    civil war    I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help  and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children. And I thought  maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist. So I went to Russia  and my mother also   during the  time of  the  Soviet Union. So some of our character  maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. So that's how I decided  to do  the same. My sister was different. She's here. She's also a doctor. She graduated in Russia also. And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war    when I was     and my sister was     when the civil war broke out. So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '  s    that's what made us go back and work for them. PM  So what is the biggest challenge working  mother and daughter  in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations  HA  Yes  I was working in a tough situation  very dangerous. And when I saw the people who needed me  I was staying with them to help  because I  could  do something for them. Most people fled abroad. But I remained with those people  and I was trying to do something     any  little thing I  could  do. I succeeded in my place. Now my place is        people who are respecting each other  who are not fighting. But we try to stand on our feet  to do something  little things  we can for our people. And I'm thankful for my daughters. When they come to me  they help me to treat the people  to help. They do everything for them. They have done what I desire to do for them. PM  What's the best part of working with your mother  and the most challenging part for you  DM  She's very tough  it's most challenging. She always expects us to do more. And really when you think  you  cannot do it  she will push you  and I can do it. That's the best part. She shows us  trains us how to do and how to be better  people  and how to do long hours in surgery        patients per day         surgeries  and still you have to manage the camp    that's how she trains us. It is not like beautiful offices here     patients  you're tired. You see     patients     surgeries and        people to manage. PM  But you do it for good reasons. Wait. Wait. HA  Thank you. DM  Thank you. HA  Thank you very much. DM  Thank you very much. I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples. These are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider. They produce six different types of silk  which is spun together into a fiber  tougher than any fiber humans have ever made. The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber. And to make that  it involves extremes of temperature  extremes of pressure and loads of pollution. And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn. This beetle can detect a forest fire at    kilometers away. That's roughly        times the range of man made fire detectors. And what's more  this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels. So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver. If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does  we could achieve factor     factor      maybe even factor       savings in resource and energy use. And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution  I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about. Firstly  radical increases in resource efficiency. Secondly  shifting from a linear  wasteful  polluting way of using resources to a closed loop model. And thirdly  changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy. And for all three of these  I believe  biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need. You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products  and all of those have benefited from a  .  billion year research and development period. And given that level of investment  it makes sense to use it. So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas. And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency. When we were working on the Eden Project  we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular  but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried. It was a hell of a challenge  and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. So for instance  it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels. Studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons. The next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons. And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass  which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes. And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes. So we started exploring this material called ETFE. It's a high strength polymer. And what you do is you put it together in three layers  you weld it around the edge  and then you inflate it. And the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass  and it was only one percent of the weight of double glazing. So that was a factor     saving. And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. So with such large  lightweight pillows  we had much less steel. With less steel we were getting more sunlight in  which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter. And with less overall weight in the superstructure  there were big savings in the foundations. And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency    delivering the same function  but with a fraction of the resource input. And actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions. So for instance  you could develop super efficient roof structures based on giant Amazon water lilies  whole buildings inspired by abalone shells  super lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells. There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool. So now I want to go onto talking about the linear to closed loop idea. The way we tend to use resources is we extract them  we turn them into short life products and then dispose of them. Nature works very differently. In ecosystems  the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system. And there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems. And one of my favorites is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project by Graham Wiles. And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food  cardboard and plastic waste. It was ending up in landfills. Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste. And I'm just going to talk through this animation. So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants. They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding. When that was soiled  they were paid again to collect it. They put it into worm recomposting systems  which produced a lot of worms  which they fed to Siberian sturgeon  which produced caviar  which they sold back to the restaurants. So it transformed a linear process into a closed loop model  and it created more value in the process. Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this  turning waste streams into schemes that create value. And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time  there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. And I know it's a quirky example  but I think the implications of this are quite radical  because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem    waste    into a massive opportunity. And particularly in cities    we could look at the whole metabolism of cities  and look at those as opportunities. And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about  the Mobius Project  where we're trying to bring together a number of activities  all within one building  so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another. And the kind of elements I'm talking about are  firstly  we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse  a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas. Then we would have an anaerobic digester  which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area  turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid. We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater  turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro organisms. We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant. And we'd also have a coffee shop  and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms. So you can see that we're bringing together cycles of food  energy and water and waste all within one building. And just for fun  we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London  which at the moment is a complete eyesore. Some of you may recognize this. And with just a little bit of planning  we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people  reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities. So the final project I want to talk about is the Sahara Forest Project  which we're working on at the moment. It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago. So for instance  when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa  huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests. And during the evolution of life on the Earth  it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy. The converse is also true. The more vegetation we lose  the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification. And this animation  this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years  and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot  and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt  or maybe even reverse  desertification. And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts  there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. This is the Namibian fog basking beetle  and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert. The way it does this is it comes out at night  crawls to the top of a sand dune  and because it's got a matte black shell  is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings. So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea  you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell. Just before sunrise  he tips his shell up  the water runs down into his mouth  has a good drink  goes off and hides for the rest of the day. And the ingenuity  if you could call it that  goes even further. Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell  there are lots of little bumps on that shell. And those bumps are hydrophilic  they attract water. Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water. And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps  they stay in tight  spherical beads  which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell. So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air  it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth. So amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource constrained environment    and in that sense  very relevant to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing over the next few years  next few decades. We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse. This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions  and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills  and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through  it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process. So inside it's cool and humid  which means the plants need less water to grow. And then at the back of the greenhouse  it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle. And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. So they just started spreading this on the land around  and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. This photograph was taken on completion day  and just one year later  it looked like that. So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land    and in that sense  going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design. So we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits. And when you think about nature  often you think about it as being all about competition. But actually in mature ecosystems  you're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships. So an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters. And the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse is concentrated solar power  which uses solar tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat to create electricity. And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP  consider that we receive        times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms           times. So our energy problems are not intractable. It's a challenge to our ingenuity. And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are  firstly  both these technologies work very well in hot  sunny deserts. CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater. That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces. CSP produces a lot of waste heat. We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits. And finally  in the shade under the mirrors  it's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight. So this is how this scheme would look. The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind. We'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way. Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts. And with biomimicry  if you've got an underutilized resource  you don't think   How am I going to dispose of this   You think   What can I add to the system to create more value   And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages. When you evaporate seawater  the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. And that builds up on the evaporators    and that's what that image on the left is    gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate. So after a while  we could take that out  use it as a lightweight building block. And if you think about the carbon in that  that would have come out of the atmosphere  into the sea and then locked away in a building product. The next thing is sodium chloride. You can also compress that into a building block  as they did here. This is a hotel in Bolivia. And then after that  there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract  like phosphates  that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them. And there's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater. So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high performance batteries. And in parts of the Arabian Gulf  the seawater  the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse. Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine. We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts  transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity. Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero carbon food  abundant renewable energy in some of the most water stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning  radical increases in resource efficiency  closing loops and a solar economy. They're not just possible  they're critical. And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions. But perhaps more than anything  what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design. Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language. But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing. And this is an important point. Antoine de Saint Exupery once said   If you want to build a flotilla of ships  you don't sit around talking about carpentry. No  you need to set people's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores.  And that's what we need to do  so let's be positive  and let's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby  curly haired guy from Holland    why is he whistling  Well actually  I've  been  whistling since the age of four  about four. My dad was always whistling around the house  and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually  till I was     I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling  because  to be honest  my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. I whistled on  my  bike. I whistled everywhere. And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family in law. And they had some  in my opinion  terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like  I try to make it better. So  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer     you know it  But it can also sound like this. But during a Christmas party    at dinner actually    it's very annoying. So my sister in law asked me a few times   Please stop whistling.  And I just couldn't. And at one point    and I had some wine  I have to admit that    at one point I said   If there was a contest  I would join.  And two weeks later I received a text message   You're going to America.  So  okay  I'm going to America. I would love to  but why  So I immediately called her up  of course. She Googled  and she found this World Whistling Championship in America  of course. She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. I lost my face. And she thought   He will never go there.  But actually I did. So I went to Louisburg  North Carolina  southeast United States  and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the world championship  and I won there in     . That was great fun  of course. And to defend my title    like judokas do and sportsmen    I thought  well let's go back in       and I won again. Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in      I entered again in Japan  Tokyo  and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam  in the beautiful city  on a big stage  and I'm talking about whistling. And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse. And I try to live my dream    well  actually  it was never my dream  but it sounds so good. Okay  I'm not the only one whistling here. You say   Huh  what do you mean   Well actually  you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens  people are watching each other and think   Oh  my God. Why  Can I go away   No  you can't. Actually it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called  F te de la Belle.  It's about    minutes long. No  no  no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. So I whistle the tone. Sorry. I forgot one thing. You whistle the same tone as me. I heard a wide variety of tones. This is very promising. This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started  I just point where you whistle along  and we will see what happens. Oh  hah. I'm so sorry  technicians. I'm so used to that. I start it myself. Okay  here it is. Okay. It's easy  isn't it  Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself. Max Westerman  Geert Chatrou  the World Champion  of  Whistling. Geert Chatrou  Thank you. Thank you. We're here to celebrate compassion. But compassion  from my vantage point  has a problem. As essential as it is across our traditions  as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives  the word  compassion  is hollowed out in our culture  and it is suspect in my field of journalism. It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing  or it's seen as potentially depressing. Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and  after the fact  the word  compassion  was translated as  pity.  Now compassion  when it enters the news  too often comes in the form of feel good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter  that they shape the way we understand ourselves  the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others. When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the     s  we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. Now the word  tolerance   if you look at it in the dictionary  connotes  allowing    indulging  and  enduring.  In the medical context that it comes from  it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment. Tolerance is not really a lived virtue  it's more of a cerebral ascent. And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. And the going is pretty rough right now. I think that without perhaps being able to name it  we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue. Compassion is a worthy successor. It is organic  across our religious  spiritual and ethical traditions  and yet it transcends them. Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others  both in our private and in our civic spaces. So what is it  three dimensionally  What are its kindred and component parts  What's in its universe of attendant virtues  To start simply  I want to say that compassion is kind. Now  kindness  might sound like a very mild word  and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification. Compassion is also curious. Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles  Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi. They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims  and as they do that  they cultivate what they call  curiosity without assumptions.  Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation  but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there  just showing up. I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty    and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other  not just what it is about them that might need helping. I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. And in that light  for the religious  compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery    encouraging us not just to see beauty  but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering  in the face of a stranger  in the face of the vibrant religious other. I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like  but I can show you what compassion looks like    because it is visible. When we see it  we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable  what is possible. It is so important when we're communicating big ideas    but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion    to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood    the color and complexity of life. And compassion does seek physicality. I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford. And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him  but he's paraplegic. He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was     in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. Matthew's legs don't work  and he'll never walk again  and    and he does experience this as an  and  rather than a  but     and he experiences himself to be healed and whole. And as a teacher of yoga  he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability  health  illness and aging. He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. I can't quite explain it  and he can't either. But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body  in all its frailty and its grace  without  at the same time  becoming more compassionate towards all of life. Compassion also looks like this. This is Jean Vanier. Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities  which you can now find all over the world  communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities    mostly Down syndrome. The communities that Jean Vanier founded  like Jean Vanier himself  exude tenderness.  Tender  is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting. We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive  and I spend a lot of time being those things too. And compassion can also have those qualities. But again and again  lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness. Jean Vanier says that his work  like the work of other people    his great  beloved  late friend Mother Teresa    is never in the first instance about changing the world  it's in the first instance about changing ourselves. He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution  but a sign. Compassion is rarely a solution  but it is always a sign of a deeper reality  of deeper human possibilities. And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories  never by statistics and strategies. We need those things too  but we're also bumping up against their limits. And at the same time that we are doing that  I think we are rediscovering the power of story    that as human beings  we need stories to survive  to flourish  to change. Our traditions have always known this  and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us. There is  of course  a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world    tikkun olam. And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen  who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her  that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. And that the highest human calling is to look for this light  to point at it when we see it  to gather it up  and in so doing  to repair the world. Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way. Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time  because this story insists that each and every one of us  frail and flawed as we may be  inadequate as we may feel  has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch. Stories like this  signs like this  are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing  how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine    the work Fred Luskin is doing    I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the   st century    that science  in fact  is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism. This is going to change science  I believe  and it will change religion. But here's a face from   th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion. We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E   mc . We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer  Marian Anderson  to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South. Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions. But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early   th century. He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three year old. And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced  we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more  not less. He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages. Some of his favorites were Moses  Jesus  Buddha  St. Francis of Assisi  Gandhi    he adored his contemporary  Gandhi. And Einstein said    and I think this is a quote  again  that has not been passed down in his legacy    that  these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living  more necessary to the dignity  security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge.  Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us  but actually it is. I want to show you the rest of this photograph  because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word  compassion  in our culture    we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life  which is messy. So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral    it's not. This is the full photograph  and you see a middle aged man wearing a leather jacket  smoking a cigar. And by the look of that paunch  he hasn't been doing enough yoga. We put these two photographs side by side on our website  and someone said   When I look at the first photo  I ask myself  what was he thinking  And when I look at the second  I ask  what kind of person was he  What kind of man is this   Well  he was complicated. He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. And it is much harder  often  to be compassionate towards those closest to us  which is another quality in the universe of compassion  on its dark side  that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. Gandhi  too  was a real flawed human being. So was Martin Luther King  Jr. So was Dorothy Day. So was Mother Teresa. So are we all. And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion    following on what Fred Luskin says    that these flaws just make us human. Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems  in fact  are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion  towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life long struggle with Crohn's disease. Einstein became a humanitarian  not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter  but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. And Karen Armstrong  I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that  with a zigzag  have led to the Charter for Compassion. Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity. So I want to propose a final definition of compassion    this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way    and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this  and we need them to mine it for us now. But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious. So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity  the future of humanity  needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race. Thank you. I want you to take a look at this baby. What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see    what's going on up in that little brain of hers. The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science. And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the  celestial openness  of the child's mind. What we see here is a mother in India  and she's speaking Koro  which is a newly discovered language. And she's talking to her baby. What this mother    and the     people who speak Koro in the world    understands  is  that  to preserve this language  they need to speak it to the babies. And therein lies a critical puzzle. Why is it that you can't preserve a language by speaking to you and I  to the adults  Well  it's got to do with your brain. What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning. The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis. And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language. Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven  and then there's a systematic decline. After puberty  we fall off the map. No scientists dispute this curve  but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way. Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development    and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. We think  by studying how the sounds are learned  we'll have a model for the rest of language  and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social  emotional and cognitive development. So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages. The baby sits on a parent's lap  and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes    like from  ah  to  ee.  If they do so at the appropriate time  the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum. A six monther adores the task. What have we learned  Well  babies all over the world are what I like to describe as  citizens of the world.  They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages  no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using  and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that. We're culture bound listeners. We can discriminate the sounds of our own language  but not those of foreign languages. So the question arises  when do those citizens of the world turn into the language bound listeners that we are  And the answer  before their first birthdays. What you see here is performance on that head turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States  here in Seattle  as they listened to  ra  and  la     sounds important to English  but not to Japanese. So at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent. Two months later something incredible occurs. The babies in the United States are getting a lot better  babies in Japan are getting a lot worse  but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn. So the question is  what's happening during this critical two month period  This is the critical period for sound development  but what's going on up there  So there are two things going on. The first is that the babies are listening intently to us  and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk    they're taking statistics. So listen to two mothers speaking motherese    the universal language we use when we talk to kids    first in English and then in Japanese. so pretty and nice. Japanese Mother   Japanese  Patricia Kuhl  During the production of speech  when babies listen  what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. And those distributions grow. And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics  and the statistics of Japanese and English are very  very different. English has a lot of Rs and Ls. The distribution shows. And the distribution of Japanese is totally different  where we see a group of intermediate sounds  which is known as the Japanese  R.  So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains  it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture bound listeners that we are. But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics. We're governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development. So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize. It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people. Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them  one after the other  depending on who they're speaking to. So we asked ourselves  can the babies take statistics on a brand new language  And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. We knew that  when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds  they showed the same pattern. Six to eight months  they're totally equivalent. Two months later  something incredible happens. But the Taiwanese babies are getting better  not the American babies. What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin. It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for    sessions. Here's what it looked like in the laboratory. PK  So what have we done to their little brains  We had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills. So a group of babies came in and listened to English. And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin. But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for    sessions. They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for    and a half months. What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. Whatever you put in front of them  they'll take statistics on. But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise. So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage  the same    sessions  but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. What did we do to their brains  What you see here is the audio result    no learning whatsoever    and the video result    no learning whatsoever. It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics. The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics. We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions  as opposed to in front of human beings. Thankfully  we have a new machine  magnetoencephalography  that allows us to do this. It looks like a hair dryer from Mars. But it's completely safe  completely non invasive and silent. We're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using     SQUIDs    these are Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices    to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking. We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning. So this is little Emma. She's a six monther. And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. You can see  she can move around. We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap  so she's free to move completely unconstrained. It's a technical tour de force. What are we seeing  We're seeing the baby brain. As the baby hears a word in her language the auditory areas light up  and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence  getting the brain coordinated with its different areas  and causality  one brain area causing another to activate. We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child's brain development. We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion  as they learn to speak and read  as they solve a math problem  as they have an idea. And we're going to be able to invent brain based interventions for children who have difficulty learning. Just as the poets and writers described  we're going to be able to see  I think  that wondrous openness  utter and complete openness  of the mind of a child. In investigating the child's brain  we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human  and in the process  we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives. Thank you. I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days  talking to groups of students and professionals  and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes. On the one hand  people say   The time for change is now.  They want to be part of it. They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning. But on the other hand  I hear people talking about fear  a sense of risk aversion. They say   I really want to follow a life of purpose  but I don't know where to start. I don't want to disappoint my family or friends.  I work in global poverty. And they say   I want to work in global poverty  but what will it mean about my career  Will I be marginalized  Will I not make enough money  Will I never get married or have children   And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older    and I'm glad I waited       and has no children  I look at these young people and I say   Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is only to be human. And nothing important happens in life without a cost.  These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level. Our leaders and ourselves want everything  but we don't talk about the costs. We don't talk about the sacrifice. One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen  the great American writer from the South. In a short story called  Oh Yes   she talks about a white woman in the     s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl  and she looks at her child with a sense of pride  but she also wonders  what price will she pay   Better immersion than to live untouched.  But the real question is  what is the cost of not daring  What is the cost of not trying  I've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion. One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. She was a leader of the Menominee tribe  a Native American peoples. And when we would gather as fellows  she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions. And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future  looking at them from the Earth  and they would look at them  holding them as stewards for that future. Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other  not only as human beings  but to every living thing on the planet. And tragically  in       when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people  focused on preserving their culture and language  she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC. And whenever we would gather the fellows after that  we would leave a chair empty for her spirit. And more than a decade later  when I talk to NGO fellows  whether in Trenton  New Jersey or the office of the White House  and we talk about Ingrid  they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission. And when we think about legacy  I can think of no more powerful one  despite how short her life was. And I've been touched by Cambodian women    beautiful women  women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia. And I met them in the early '  s. In the     s  under the Pol Pot regime  the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people  and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals  the artists  the dancers. And at the end of the war  there were only    of these classical dancers still living. And the women  who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors  told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps. They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance  hoping that others were alive and doing the same. And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage  her hands at her side  and she talked about the reunion of the    after the war and how extraordinary it was. And these big tears fell down her face  but she never lifted her hands to move them. And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls  because they had grown too old already  but the next generation. And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands    beautiful rhythms    as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them  wearing these beautiful silk colors. And I thought  after all this atrocity  this is how human beings really pray. Because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future. And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure. I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership. And I have learned that power  particularly in its absolute form  is an equal opportunity provider. In       I moved to Rwanda  and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank. And one of the women was Agnes    there on your extreme left    she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda  and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda. We built this institution based on social justice  gender equity  this idea of empowering women. But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end. And though she had been part of building a liberal party  a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance  about three months before the genocide  she switched parties and joined the extremist party  Hutu Power  and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide. And I would visit her in the prisons  sitting side by side  knees touching  and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us  but that maybe it's not monsters so much  but the broken parts of ourselves  sadnesses  secret shame  and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts  those fragments  if you will  and to make us look at other beings  human beings  as lesser than ourselves    and in the extreme  to do terrible things. And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men. I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male. And so in a gathering where we're focused on women  while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them  we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered  unable to provide. And that  when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job  no education  no possibility  well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun. Sometimes very small investments can release enormous  infinite potential that exists in all of us. One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization  Suraj Sudhakar  has what we call moral imagination    the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. And he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world  Kibera. And they're incredible guys. And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums  and they're reading many TED authors and liking it. And then they created a business plan competition. Then they decided that they would do TEDx's. And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men. Alex  in some ways  said it best. He said   We used to feel like nobodies  but now we feel like somebodies.  And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link. What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other. And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV  or at best  microfinance. And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare    the photojournalists and the creatives  the graffiti artists  the teachers and the entrepreneurs. And they're doing it. And my hat's off to you in Kibera. My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive. At Acumen Fund  we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital    money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity  but as full bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. We leave our money for    to    years  and when we get it back  we invest in other innovations that focus on change. I know it works. We've invested more than    million dollars in    companies  and those companies have brought another     million dollars into these forgotten markets. This year alone  they've delivered    million services like maternal health care and housing  emergency services  solar energy  so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems. Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions  easy categories  because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument. But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit. And ultimately  we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact  measuring what is most important to us. And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it  but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways. And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change. Last May I had this extraordinary    hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side by side    one based on violence and the other on transcendence. I happened to be in Lahore  Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers. And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim. And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives  but they did more  because they created more hatred  more rage  more fear and certainly despair. But less than    hours  I was    miles away from those mosques  visiting one of our Acumen investees  an incredible man  Jawad Aslam  who dares to live a life of immersion. Born and raised in Baltimore  he studied real estate  worked in commercial real estate  and after      decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference. For two years  he hardly made any money  a tiny stipend  but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui. And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital  but he continued to pay a price. He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes. It took almost two years just to register the land. But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action. Today        people live in     houses in this beautiful community. And there's schools and clinics and shops. But there's only one mosque. And so I asked Jawad   How do you guys navigate  This is a really diverse community. Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays   He said   Long story. It was hard  it was a difficult road  but ultimately the leaders of the community came together  realizing we only have each other. And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams  and those imams would take turns  they would rotate who would say Friday prayer. But the whole community  all the different sects  including Shi'a and Sunni  would sit together and pray.  We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds. We face huge issues as a world    the financial crisis  global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness. And every day we have a choice. We can take the easier road  the more cynical road  which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was  a fear of each other  distancing and blame. Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation  transcendence  compassion and love  but also accountability and justice. I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles  who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States. And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six year old girl named Ruby Bridges  the first child to desegregate schools in the South    in this case  New Orleans. And he said that every day this six year old  dressed in her beautiful dress  would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily  calling her a monster  threatening to poison her    distorted faces. And every day he would watch her  and it looked like she was talking to the people. And he would say   Ruby  what are you saying   And she'd say   I'm not talking.  And finally he said   Ruby  I see that you're talking. What are you saying   And she said   Dr. Coles  I am not talking  I'm praying.  And he said   Well  what are you praying   And she said   I'm praying  'Father  forgive them  for they know not what they are doing.'  At age six  this child was living a life of immersion  and her family paid a price for it. But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education. My final story is about a young  beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga  who was another Acumen Fund fellow  who hails from Uganda  a farming community. And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya  just     miles away. And he said to me at the end of his year   Jacqueline  it was so humbling  because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture. But especially when I was talking to the African women  I sometimes made these mistakes    it was so hard for me to learn how to listen.  And he said   So I conclude that  in many ways  leadership is like a panicle of rice. Because at the height of the season  at the height of its powers  it's beautiful  it's green  it nourishes the world  it reaches to the heavens.  And he said   But right before the harvest  it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came.  We need leaders. We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can  ourselves  extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man  woman and child on this planet. And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone. Robert Kennedy once said that  few of us have the greatness to bend history itself  but each of us can work to change a small portion of events.  And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written. Our lives are so short  and our time on this planet is so precious  and all we have is each other. So may each of you live lives of immersion. They won't necessarily be easy lives  but in the end  it is all that will sustain us. Thank you. I'm speaking to you about what I call the  mesh.  It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff  with the things in our lives. And it's starting to look at    not always and not for everything    but in certain moments of time  access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them. And so it's the pursuit of better things  easily shared. And we come from a long tradition of sharing. We've shared transportation. We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam. We've also shared other sorts of entertainment    sports arenas  public parks  concert halls  libraries  universities. All these things are share platforms  but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the  mother of all share platforms.  And as I think about the mesh and I think about  well  what's driving it  how come it's happening now  I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. One is the recession    that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value    so starting to align the value with the true cost. Secondly  population growth and density into cities. More people  smaller spaces  less stuff. Climate change  we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet. Also  there's been this recent distrust of big brands  global big brands  in a bunch of different industries  and that's created an opening. Research is showing here  in the States  and in Canada and Western Europe  that most of us are much more open to local companies  or brands that maybe we haven't heard of. Whereas before  we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted. And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before    except for if you're sitting next to someone. The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades  and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance. It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way. It's also    Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems  and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance. It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways. And so for me  a mesh company  the  classic  mesh company  brings together these three things  our ability to connect to each other    most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS enabled and Web enabled    allows us to find each other and find things in time and space. And third is that physical things are readable on a map    so restaurants  a variety of venues  but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that  we can also track things that are moving  like a car  a taxicab  a transit system  a box that's moving through time and space. And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them. For example  I want to use Zipcar. How many people here have experienced car sharing or bike sharing  Wow  that's great. Okay  thank you. Basically Zipcar is the largest car sharing company in the world. They did not invent car sharing. Car sharing was actually invented in Europe. One of the founders went to Switzerland  saw it implemented someplace  said   Wow  that looks really cool. I think we can do that in Cambridge   brought it to Cambridge and they started    two women    Robin Chase being the other person who started it. Zipcar got some really important things right. First  they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir. And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car sharing. They made it sexy. They made it fresh. They made it aspirational. If you were a member of the club  when you're a member of a club  you're a Zipster. The cars they picked didn't look like ex cop cars that were hollowed out or something. They picked these sexy cars. They targeted to universities. They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching. It was a very nice experience  and the cars were clean and reliable  and it all worked. And so from a branding perspective  they got a lot right. But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company. They understand that they are an information company. Because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once  we have an interaction  and we're chow    usually as quickly as possible. But when you're sharing a car and you have a car share service  you might use an E.V. to commute  you get a truck because you're doing a home project. When you pick your aunt up at the airport  you get a sedan. And you're going to the mountains to ski  you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing. Meanwhile  these guys are sitting back  collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service. And so it's not only an option for them  but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us  to be like a concierge service. Because we give them so much information  and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving. They're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next. And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car  What percentage of the time  Any guesses  Those are really very good. I was imagining it was like    percent when I first started. The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent. And so basically even if you think it's    percent     percent of the time  something that costs us a lot of money    personally  and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things       percent of the time it's sitting around. So for this reason  I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that  if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away  there's a lot of value in those things. What set up with Zipcar    Zipcar started in     . In the last year        two car companies started  one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar  and the other one  RelayRides  in the U.S. They're both peer to peer car sharing services  because the two things that really work for car sharing is  one  the car has to be available  and two  it's within one or two blocks of where you stand. Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car  and it's probably also available. So people have created this business. Zipcar started a decade earlier  in     . It took them six years to get       cars in service. WhipCar  which started April of last year  it took them six months to get       cars in the service. So  really interesting. People are making anywhere between     and     dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it. So it's like vacation rentals for cars. Since I'm here    and I hope some people in the audience are in the car business       I'm thinking that  coming from the technology side of things    we saw cable ready TVs and WiFi ready Notebooks    it would be really great if  any minute now  you guys could start rolling share ready cars off. Because it just creates more flexibility. It allows us as owners to have other options. And I think we're going there anyway. The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses    and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses  or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies  car manufacturers  who are beginning to offer their own car share services as well as a second flanker brand  or as really a test  I think    is to make sharing irresistible. We have experiences in our lives  certainly  when sharing has been irresistible. It's just  how do we make that recurrent and scale it  We know also  because we're connected in social networks  that it's easy to create delight in one little place. It's contagious because we're all connected to each other. So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it  or I tell five people standing next to me  news travels. The opposite  as we know  is also true  often more true. So here we have LudoTruck  which is in L.A.  doing the things that gourmet food trucks do  and they've gathered quite a following. In general  and maybe  again  it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur  I look at things as platforms. Platforms are invitations. So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network  there are all these networks    Facebook as well. These platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience. And honestly  it's full of surprises. Because I don't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook  around Facebook  for example  two years ago  when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform. So in this way  I think that cities are platforms  and certainly Detroit is a platform. The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs    it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive. It's inviting participation  and cities have  historically  invited all sorts of participation. Now we're saying that there's other options as well. So  for example  city departments can open up transit data. Google has made available transit data API. And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S. that have provided the transit data  and different developers are building applications. So I was having a coffee in Portland  and half of a latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in    minutes. And so it's reliable  real data that's right in my face  where I am  so I can finish the latte. There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now  about    percent of vacant commercial and industrial space. That space is not vital. The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement. There's this thing    how many people here have heard of pop up stores or pop up shops  Oh  great. So I'm a big fan of this. And this is a very mesh y thing. Essentially  there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland  near where I live. There's a pop up general store every three weeks  and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies. Super fun  and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood. Subsequent to that  after it's been going for about a year now  they actually started to lease and create and extend. An area that was edgy artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people. So this is an example. The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts  and she does these pop up crafts fairs around London. But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments. From my perspective  one of the things pop up stores do is create perishability and urgency. It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson  sold out. And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing. So a lot of what we see in the mesh  and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define  refine and scale. It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur  to go to market  to be in conversation with people  listen  refine something and go back. It's very cost effective  and it's very mesh y. The infrastructure enables that. In closing  and as we're moving towards the end  I just also want to encourage    and I'm willing to share my failures as well  though not from the stage. I would just like to say that one of the big things  when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other  but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation  is by sharing failures. And one quick example is Velib  in       came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition  a very big bike sharing service. They made a lot of mistakes. They had some number of big successes. But they were very transparent  or they had to be  in the way that they exposed what worked and didn't work. And so B.C. in Barcelona and B cycle and Boris Bikes in London    no one has had to repeat the version  .  screw ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris. So the opportunity when we're connected is also to share failures and successes. We're at the very beginning of something that  what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward  is inviting  it's engaging  but it's very early. I have a website    it's a directory    and it started with about       companies  and in the last two and a half months it's up to about       companies. And it grows on a very regular daily basis. But it's very much at the beginning. So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride. And thank you very much. Pat Mitchell  What is the story of this pin  Madeleine Albright  This is  Breaking the Glass Ceiling.  PM  Oh. That was well chosen  I would say  for TEDWomen. MA  Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen. And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein. I'll tell you what happened. I went to the United Nations as an ambassador  and it was after the Gulf War  and I was an instructed ambassador. And the cease fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions  and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly  which he deserved    he had invaded another country. And so all of a sudden  a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things  but among them an  unparalleled serpent.  And so I happened to have a snake pin. So I wore it when we talked about Iraq. And when I went out to meet the press  they zeroed in  said   Why are you wearing that snake pin   I said   Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent.  And then I thought  well this is fun. So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would  in fact  reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day. So that's how it all started. PM  So how large is the collection  MA  Pretty big. It's now traveling. At the moment it's in Indianapolis  but it was at the Smithsonian. And it goes with a book that says   Read My Pins.  PM  So is this a good idea. I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State  and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing  how you looked    the thing that happens to a lot of women  especially if they're the first in a position. So how do you feel about that    the whole    MA  Well  it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. But people did pay attention to what clothes I had. What was interesting was that  before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador  I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick  who'd been ambassador before me  and she said   You've got to get rid of your professor clothes. Go out and look like a diplomat.  So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping. But still  there were all kinds of questions about     did you wear a hat    How short was your skirt   And one of the things    if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots  and she got criticized over that. And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it. PM  It is  for all of us  men and women  finding our ways of defining our roles  and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother  a grandmother  nurturing ... and so how did you handle that  MA  Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. And I said   Well I've been a woman for    years  but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.  So it evolved. But basically I love being a woman. And so what happened    and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this    I went to my first meeting  first at the U.N.  and that's when this all started  because that is a very male organization. And I'm sitting there    there are    members of the Security Council    so    men sat there staring at me  and I thought    well you know how we all are. You want to get the feeling of the room  and  do people like me   and  will I really say something intelligent   And all of a sudden I thought   Well  wait a minute. I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States ' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard   and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal  reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country. And so that happened more at various times  but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman. I think we are a lot better at personal relationships  and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary. But I have to tell you  I have my youngest granddaughter  when she turned seven last year  said to her mother  my daughter   So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State  Only girls are Secretary of State.  PM  Because in her lifetime    MA  That would be so. PM  What a change that is. As you travel now all over the world  which you do frequently  how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls  Where are we  MA  I think we're slowly changing  but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different. And therefore it means that we have to remember that  while many of us have had huge opportunities    and Pat  you have been a real leader in your field    is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women. And so what I have felt    and I have looked at this from a national security issue    when I was Secretary of State  I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy  not just because I'm a feminist  but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered  that values are passed down  the health situation is better  education is better  there is greater economic prosperity. So I think that it behooves us    those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice    that we need to help other women. And I really dedicated myself to that  both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State. PM  And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy  MA  From some people. I think that they thought that it was a soft issue. The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues  because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects  and because  as I said  it is really central to the way that we think about things. Now for instance  some of the wars that took place when I was in office  a lot of them  the women were the main victims of it. For instance  when I started  there were wars in the Balkans. The women in Bosnia were being raped. We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues. And by the way  one of the things that I did at that stage was  I had just arrived at the U.N.  and when I was there  there were     countries in the U.N. Now there are    . But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. So I said to my assistant   Invite the other women permanent representatives.  And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there. I get there  and there are six other women  out of    . So the countries that had women representatives were Canada  Kazakhstan  Philippines  Trinidad Tobago  Jamaica  Lichtenstein and me. So being an American  I decided to set up a caucus. And so we set it up  and we called ourselves the G . PM  Is that  Girl     MA  Girl  . And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues. So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal. And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war  that it was against humanity. PM  So when you look around the world and you see that  in many cases    certainly in the Western world    women are evolving into more leadership positions  and even other places some barriers are being brought down  but there's still so much violence  still so many problems  and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables. Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't  when there was maybe you    one voice  maybe one or two others. Do you believe  and can you tell us why  there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis  MA  Well I do think  when there are more women  that the tone of the conversation changes  and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that  you've forgotten high school. But the bottom line is that there is a way  when there are more women at the table  that there's an attempt to develop some understanding. So for instance  what I did when I went to Burundi  we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda. And so I think the capability of women to put themselves    I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy. I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room. When I was Secretary of State  there were only    other women foreign ministers. And so it was nice when one of them would show up. For instance  she is now the president of Finland  but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and  at a certain stage  head of the European Union. And it was really terrific. Because one of the things I think you'll understand. We went to a meeting  and the men in my delegation  when I would say   Well I feel we should do something about this   and they'd say   What do you mean  you feel   And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me. And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control  and she said   Well I feel we should do this.  And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions. The other thing that I think is really important  A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy  but it's about budgets  military budgets  and how the debts of countries work out. So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts  they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries. PM  So how do we get this balance we're looking for  then  in the world  More women's voices at the table  More men who believe that the balance is best  MA  Well I think one of the things    I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates. I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office  to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices. I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other. Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about  because I am of a certain age where  when I started in my career  believe it or not  there were other women who criticized me   Why aren't you in the carpool line   or  Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time   And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. In fact  I think  guilt  is every woman's middle name. And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other. PM  Well Secretary Albright  I guess you'll be going to heaven. Thank you for joining us today. MA  Thank you all. Thanks Pat. It's Monday morning. In Washington  the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office  assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen. At Number    Downing Street  David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double dip recession. In Madrid  Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door  listening to her baby crying and crying  trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it. And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital  trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one and a half liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said   You must make him drink today      my father's been nil by mouth for a week    or whether  by giving him this bottle  I might actually kill him. We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives  and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions. We talk things over with our friends  we scour the Internet  we search through books. But still  even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends  it's still experts that we rely upon most    especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters. Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity  we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can    that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own. And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing  we feel reassured by the almost parental like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do. But I believe that this is a big problem  a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society  as a culture and as individuals. It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world    of course they have. The problem lies with us  we've become addicted to experts. We've become addicted to their certainty  their assuredness  their definitiveness  and in the process  we have ceded our responsibility  substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom. We've surrendered our power  trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. This is no exaggeration. In a recent experiment  a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak. The results were quite extraordinary. As they listened to the experts' voices  the independent decision making parts of their brains switched off. It literally flat lined. And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice  however right or wrong. But experts do get things wrong. Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of     Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself  you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you  And then there's  of course  the example that we're all too aware of  financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the     s. For the sake of our health  our wealth and our collective security  it's imperative that we keep the independent decision making parts of our brains switched on. And I'm saying this as an economist who  over the past few years  has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why  but also    and I'm aware of the irony here    as an expert myself  as a professor  as somebody who advises prime ministers  heads of big companies  international organizations  but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change  that we need to become more open minded  more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view. So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from  let me bring you into my world  the world of experts. Now there are  of course  exceptions  wonderful  civilization enhancing exceptions. But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps  that within these camps  a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition  that experts move with the prevailing winds  often hero worshipping their own gurus. Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on  not challenged by his peers  until after the crisis  of course. You see  we also learn that experts are located  are governed  by the social and cultural norms of their times    whether it be the doctors in Victorian England  say  who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire  or the psychiatrists in the United States who  up until       were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness. And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift  that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks    because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects  or studies funded by food companies of their new products  massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market. The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study. And we've also got to be aware that experts  of course  also make mistakes. They make mistakes every single day    mistakes born out of carelessness. A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries  operating on the wrong side of the brain  carrying out procedures on the wrong hand  elbow  eye  foot  and also mistakes born out of thinking errors. A common thinking error of radiologists  for example    when they look at CT scans    is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia  say  what happens is that  if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan  they literally stop looking at it    thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs. I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts. These are  of course  not the only insights I could share  but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them  why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision making capabilities on. But how can we do this  Well for the sake of time  I want to focus on just three strategies. First  we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern day apostles. This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D. in every single subject  you'll be relieved to hear. But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when  for example  we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand. Why was it that  when I had an operation  my doctor said to me   Beware  Ms. Hertz  of hyperpyrexia   when he could have just as easily said   Watch out for a high fever.  You see  being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs  their equations  their forecasts  their prophecies  and being armed with the questions to do that    questions like  What are the assumptions that underpin this  What is the evidence upon which this is based  What has your investigation focused on  And what has it ignored  It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first  primarily on male animals and then  primarily on men. It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men    and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed. Second  we need to create the space for what I call  managed dissent.  If we are to shift paradigms  if we are to make breakthroughs  if we are to destroy myths  we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out  in which we're bringing in new  diverse  discordant  heretical views into the discussion  fearlessly  in the knowledge that progress comes about  not only from the creation of ideas  but also from their destruction    and also from the knowledge that  by surrounding ourselves by divergent  discordant  heretical views. All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter. Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts  which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true. And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent. Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy. In meetings  he looks out for the person in the room    arms crossed  looking a bit bemused    and draws them into the discussion  trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion  so that they have dissent within the room. Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement  discord and difference. But we need to go even further. We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees  fancy titles  diplomas  best selling books    high status individuals. But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise    whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's  but also shop girls    yeah. Best Buy  the consumer electronics company  gets all its employees    the cleaners  the shop assistants  the people in the back office  not just its forecasting team    to place bets  yes bets  on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas  on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company  on whether a project will come in on time. By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company  Best Buy was able to discover  for example  that the store that it was going to open in China    its big  grand store    was not going to open on time. Because when it asked its staff  all its staff  to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not  a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening. It turned out that they were aware  as no one else within the company was  of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts  nor the experts on the ground in China  were even aware of. The strategies that I have discussed this evening    embracing dissent  taking experts on  democratizing expertise  rebellious strategies    are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing  complex  difficult times. For if we keep our independent decision making part of our brains switched on  if we challenge experts  if we're skeptical  if we devolve authority  if we are rebellious  but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance  uncertainty and doubt  and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too  we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the   st century. For now  more than ever  is not the time to be blindly following  blindly accepting  blindly trusting. Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open    yes  using experts to help us figure things out  for sure    I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here    but being aware of their limitations and  of course  also our own. Thank you. Our face is hugely important because it's the external  visual part that everybody else sees. Let's not forget it's a functional entity. We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body  the brain. It's where our senses are located  our special senses    our vision  our speech  our hearing  our smell  our taste. And this bone is peppered  as you can see  with the light shining through the skull with cavities  the sinuses  which warm and moisten the air we breathe. But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone    our head would be dead weight  we wouldn't be able to hold it erect  we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us. This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat. Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression  our universal language of expression  our social signaling system. And overlying this is the skin drape  which is a hugely complex three dimensional structure    taking right angled bends here and there  having thin areas like the eyelids  thick areas like the cheek  different colors. And then we have the sensual factor of the face. Where do we like to kiss people  On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe. It's the face where we're attracted to with that. But let's not forget the hair. You're looking at the image on your left hand side    that's my son with his eyebrows present. Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing. There's a definite difference. And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose  he'd look even odder still. Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. It's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves  and we only see ourselves in freeze frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live. Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. They don't need this. They need psychiatric help. Max has kindly donated his photograph to me. He doesn't have dysmorphophobia  but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic. In other words  he looks entirely normal. Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes. So children judge themselves  learn to judge themselves  by the behavior of adults around them. Here's a classic example  Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull  has obliterated her nose  and she's having difficulty seeing. As you can see  it's blocking her vision. She's also in danger  when she damages this  of bleeding profusely. Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them. They've grown used to their face  they think they're special. Actually  sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them. But other adults say incredibly painful things. They say   How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people. Shouldn't you be doing something about this  Why haven't you had it removed   And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion  because    a natural curiosity. And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature. After surgery  everything normalizes. The adults behave more naturally  and the children play more readily with other children. As teenagers    just think back to your teenage years    we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance. We're trying to struggle to find our identity. We crave the approval of our peers. So our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world. Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days. How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day  practicing your sardonic look  practicing your serious look  trying to look like Sean Connery  as I did  trying to raise one eyebrow  It's a crippling time. I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward. I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward. Turn to the person next to you  push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you and look at them    they look miserable. That's exactly what people used to say to Sue. She wasn't miserable at all. But people used to say to her   Why are you so miserable   People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. Teachers and peers were underestimating her  she was teased at school. So she chose to have facial surgery. After the facial surgery  she said   My face now reflects my personality. People know now that I'm enthusiastic  that I'm a happy person.  And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers. Is this change  though  a real change  or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves  Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery. And what we found was    we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after    what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery. Well that's not surprising  but we also asked them to judge them on honesty  intelligence  friendliness  violence. They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics    more violent  etc.    before the surgery. After the surgery  they were perceived as being more intelligent  more friendly  more honest  less violent    and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character. When people get older  they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery. Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma. So this is a photograph of Henry  two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face    his cheekbone  his upper jaw  his eye socket. He looks pretty good at this stage. But over the course of the next    years he had    more operations  as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly. I learned a huge amount from Henry. Henry taught me that you can carry on working. He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket. He enjoyed life to the full  and this was probably because he had a successful  fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially. He maintained a calm insouciance. I don't say he overcame this  he didn't overcome it. This was something more than that. He ignored it. He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it. And that's what these people can do. Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well. This is a man in his   s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on. It was my longest operation. It took    hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon. We removed all the bones at the right side of his face    his eye  his nose  the skull bones  the facial skin    and reconstructed him with tissue from the back. He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse. He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah. And again  he said   This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.  His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family  he had a successful  fulfilling job. So we've seen that we can change people's faces. But when we change people's faces  are we changing their identity    for better or for worse  For instance  there are two different types of facial surgery. We can categorize it like that. We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery    like Sue. When they have facial surgery  they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people. They don't feel different. They feel that they've actually gained what they never had  that their face now reflects their personality. And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery. Because you might say   Well  this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic.  If you do cosmetic surgery  patients are often less happy. They're trying to achieve difference in their lives. Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life. She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality. But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery. They're people who have their face shot off. I'll move it off  and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you. They have it forced upon them. And again  as I told you  if they have a caring family and good work life  then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives. Their identity doesn't change. Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon  Muzetta's family give the lie to this. This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face  which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly. After she had surgery to remove the tumor  her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress  a pink ribbon in her hair  and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world  despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa. So it's not simply a Western phenomenon. We make judgments on people's faces all the time. It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces. He said you could see criminal faces  judging them just on the photographs that were showed. Good looking people are always judged as being more friendly. We look at O.J.    he's a good looking guy. We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly. Now we know that he's a convicted wife batterer  and actually he's not the good guy. And beauty doesn't equate to goodness  and certainly doesn't equate to contentment. So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face  but actually  we're more comfortable with judging the moving face. We think we can judge people on their expressions. U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity    the blink  the hesitation. And so they want to see live witnesses. Todorov tells us that  in a tenth of a second  we can make a judgment on somebody's face. Are we uncomfortable with this image  Yes  we are. Would we be happy if our doctor's face  our lawyer's face  our financial adviser's face was covered  We'd be pretty uncomfortable. But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement  The truth is that there's a five minute rule  not the tenth of a second rule like Todorov  but a five minute rule. If you spend five minutes with somebody  you start looking beyond their facial appearance  and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them  and the people who you didn't immediately seek out  because you didn't find them particularly attractive  become attractive people because of their personality. So we've talked a lot about facial appearance. I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do    where we're at and where we're going. This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. And you can see in the images afterward  we've managed to reconstruct her successfully. But that's not good enough. This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking  she wants to be out climbing mountains. And that's what she achieved  and that's what we have to get to. This is a horrific image  so I'm putting my hand up now. This is a photograph of Adi  a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery. And he lost his lower jaw  his lip  his chin and his upper jaw and teeth. This is the bar that he set for us.  I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.  So with modern technology  we used computers to make models. We made a model of the jaw without bone in it. We then bent a plate up to it. We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position. We then put bone and tissue from the back. Here you can see the plate holding it  and you can see the implants being put in    so that in one operation we achieve this and this. So the patient's life is restored. That's the good news. However  his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before. It's skin from his back. It's thicker  it's darker  it's coarser  it doesn't have the contours. And that's where we're failing  and that's where we need the face transplant. The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin. We can replace the underlying skeletal structure  but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin. So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium. But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. What does that mean  They have an increased risk of infection  an increased risk of malignancy. This is not a life saving transplant    like a heart  or liver  or lung transplant    it is a quality of life transplant  and as a result  are the patients going to say  if they get a malignant cancer    or    years on   I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer   We don't know yet. We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity. Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin  who did the first operation  are studying that. Donors are going to be short on the ground  because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death  So there are going to be problems with face transplantation. So the better news is the future's almost here    and the future is tissue engineering. Just imagine  I can make a biologically degradable template. I can put it in place where it's meant to be. I can sprinkle a few cells  stem cells from the patient's own hip  a little bit of genetically engineered protein  and lo and behold  leave it for four months and the face is grown. This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe. But we've still got problems. We've got mouth cancer to solve. We're still not curing enough patients    it's the most disfiguring cancer. We're still not reconstructing them well enough. In the U.K. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people. We still can't get rid of scars. We need to do research. And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research. And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future  so we don't just sit on our laurels and say   Okay  we're doing okay. Let's leave it as it is.  Thank you very much indeed. As a child  I was raised by native Hawaiian elders    three old women who took care of me while my parents worked. The year is     . We're at the ocean. It's twilight. We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides. It's a stretch of beach we know so well. The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us. If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes  you might dismiss them as poor and simple. That would be a mistake. These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators  trained in the old ways by their elders  and now they're passing it on to me. They teach me the names of the winds and the rains  of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars. There's a new moon on the horizon. Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing. They begin to chant.  Hawaiian chant  When they finish  they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them. They want to teach me about my destiny. I thought every seven year old went through this.  Baby girl  someday the world will be in trouble. People will forget their wisdom. It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance. You will go far away. It will sometimes be a lonely road. We will not be there. But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers  and you will recognize your ohana  your family. And it will take all of you. It will take all of you.  These words  I hold onto all my life. Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me. The year is     . I'm on a remote island in Micronesia. Satawal is one half mile long by one mile wide. It's the home of my mentor. His name is Pius Mau Piailug. Mau is a palu  a navigator priest. He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world. There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island. Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments. They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars  the sequence and direction of waves  the flight patterns of certain birds. Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy. When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull  it appeared that an old man was going to rest. In fact  the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel. It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves. Mau was  in fact  gathering explicit data using his entire body. It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. Now science may dismiss this methodology  but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel. The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance. Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island  and he would look out  and then he would say   Okay  we go.  He saw that first glint of light    he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now. Their achievements  intellectually and scientifically  are extraordinary  and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms. We are in such a critical moment of our collective history. They have been compared to astronauts    these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island. Their canoes  our rockets  their sea  our space. The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot. This is part of our collective narrative. It's humanity's DNA. We cannot afford to lose it. The year is     . Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted  the world is in trouble. We live in a society bloated with data  yet starved for wisdom. We're connected       yet anxiety  fear  depression and loneliness is at an all time high. We must course correct. An African shaman said   Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes.  The link between the past and the future is fragile. This I know intimately  because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them  I struggle. I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains. Mau passed away five months ago  but his legacy and lessons live on. And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them  as potent as the Micronesian navigators  that are going dismissed  that this is a testament to brilliant  brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly. Because when an elder dies a library is burned  and throughout the world  libraries are ablaze. I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate. And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way. And this is what he said   The island is the canoe  the canoe  the island.  And what he meant was  if you are voyaging and far from home  your very survival depends on everyone aboard. You cannot make the voyage alone  you were never meant to. This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. It always was. So in closing I would offer you this  The planet is our canoe  and we are the voyagers. True navigation begins in the human heart. It's the most important map of all. Together  may we journey well. I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here because I'm going to say some radical things  about how we should think about cancer differently  to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do. But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. And that this  in fact  will be the way that we treat cancer in the future. In order to talk about cancer  I'm going to actually have to    let me get the big slide here. First  I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics. I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on    and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about  which is proteomics. Having explained those  that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer. So let me start with genomics. It is the hot topic. It is the place where we're learning the most. This is the great frontier. But it has its limitations. And in particular  you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body  and if that were only true  it would be great  but it's not. It's like the parts list of your body. It doesn't say how things are connected  what causes what and so on. So if I can make an analogy  let's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant  a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant  and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder. So it might be that  if you went to a French restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn't have butter  you could say   Ah  I see what's wrong with them. I can make them healthy.  And there probably are special cases of that. You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder. So the list of ingredients does tell you something  and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. If they have tons of salt  you might guess they're using too much salt  or something like that. But it's limited  because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant  you need to taste the food  you need to know what goes on in the kitchen  you need the product of all of those ingredients. So if I look at a person and I look at a person's genome  it's the same thing. The part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients. And so indeed  there are times when we can find ingredients that  are  bad. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease  and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. But most things  you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen  because  mostly  sick people used to be healthy people    they have the same genome. So the genome really tells you much more about predisposition. So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list. But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person    except in some of these special cases. So why all the big deal about genetics  Well first of all  it's because we can read it  which is fantastic. It is very useful in certain circumstances. It's also the great theoretical triumph of biology. It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right. It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on. And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct. So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing  and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing  and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. So this happens in physics all the time. You predict a black hole  and you look out the telescope and there it is  just like you said. But it rarely happens in biology. So this great triumph    it's so good  there's almost a religious experience in biology. And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory. So the other reason it's been very popular is because we can measure it  it's digital. And in fact  thanks to Kary Mullis  you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients. So for instance  by measuring the genome  we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome  or how we're related to each other    the family tree  or the tree of life. There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity. Now of course  in medical application  that is very useful because it's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history    except probably  your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do. And so by reading the genome  we can find out much more about your family than you probably know. And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives  but they may be surprising. I did the   andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald. But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that. But mostly what you need to know  to find out if you're sick  is not your predispositions  but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. So to do that  what you really need to do  you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics  and that's what proteomics is about. Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes  proteomics is the study of all the proteins. And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells    actually  the machines that are operating    that's where the action is. Basically  a human body is a conversation going on  both within the cells and between the cells  and they're telling each other to grow and to die  and when you're sick  something's gone wrong with that conversation. And so the trick is    unfortunately  we don't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome. So the problem is that measuring    if you try to measure all the proteins  it's a very elaborate process. It requires hundreds of steps  and it takes a long  long time. And it matters how much of the protein it is. It could be very significant that a protein changed by    percent  so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA. And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage  they pause for just a moment  and they leave something in an enzyme for a second  and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way. People have tried very hard to do this. I tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it. I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus. And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems  and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back  so I kept on giving him to the delay list. And then one day  I get a call from John Doerr  Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus's phone call. So I was like   Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.  So we started talking  and he said   I really need a better way to measure proteins.  I'm like   Looked at that. Been there. Not going to be easy.  He's like   No  no. I really need it. I mean  I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them. We have to have a window into this.  And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it. And I realized  wow  this would really make a big difference  if we could do it  and so I said   Well  let's look at it.  Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything. So we started playing around with this. And as we did it  we realized this was the basic problem    that taking the sip of coffee    that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics. And so we did that  and working with David  we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually  which makes this robotic assembly line  which  in a very consistent way  measures the protein. And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like. Basically  what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient  and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh  how slippery they are  and we arrange them in an image. And so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood. And we can take a different one tomorrow  and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different    they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep. They really tell us what's going on there. And so this picture  which looks like a big smudge to you  is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track. So if I zoom into that picture  I can just show you what it means. We sort out the proteins    from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting  and from top to bottom is how slippery they are. So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it. And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein. And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump  bump  bump  bump  bump. And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that    carbon comes in different isotopes  so if it has an extra neutron on it  we actually measure it as a different chemical. So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one. And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is. So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time  and suddenly you say   Wow  it's way more complicated than we thought it was.  But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it. So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns. So what we do with this is  for example  we can look at two patients  one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug  and ask   What's going on differently inside of them   And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences. So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red. We overlay them. This is actual data. And you can see  mostly it overlaps and it's yellow  but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug  we see that in the blood  they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug. We might not even know what this protein is  but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease. So this already  I think  is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine. But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. So let me move to cancer. The thing about cancer    when I got into this  I really knew nothing about it  but working with David Agus  I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out. And as I looked at it  to me it didn't make sense how we were approaching cancer  and in order to make sense of it  I had to learn where did this come from. We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease. We're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill. So this is the great paradigm. This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked    was the germ theory of disease. So what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose    that is  put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis    and that works great for infectious diseases. So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis  we can give you penicillin. We know that that works. If you've got malaria  we give you quinine or some derivative of it. And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do  and it's miraculous in the case of infectious disease    how well it works. And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this. But now let's apply that to systems diseases like cancer. The problem is that  in cancer  there isn't something else that's inside of you. It's you  you're broken. That conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way. So how do we diagnose that conversation  Well  right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body    you know  where did it appear     and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body. And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer  and we treat these as if they're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong. And of course  it really doesn't have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system. And in fact  I think we're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing. I think this is the big mistake. I think cancer should not be a noun. We should talk about cancering as something we do  not something we have. And so those tumors  those are symptoms of cancer. And so your body is probably cancering all the time  but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control. And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb  imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing  and the way that we talked about it  we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say   Oh  my house has water.  We might divide it    the plumber would say   Well  where's the water    Well  it's in the kitchen.   Oh  you must have kitchen water.  That's kind of the level at which it is.  Kitchen water  well  first of all  we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it. And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen  that helps. Whereas living room water  it's better to do tar on the roof.  And it sounds silly  but that's basically what we do. And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer  but I'm saying that's not really the problem  that's the symptom of the problem. What we really need to get at is the process that's going on  and that's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions  happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does  Because normally  your body is dealing with this problem all the time. So your house is dealing with leaks all the time  but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on. So what we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on  and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that. David got me invited to give a talk at National Cancer Institute and Anna Barker was there. And so I gave this talk and said   Why don't you guys do this   And Anna said   Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way. But what we're going to do  is we're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research.  So David and I applied to this program and created a consortium at USC where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world  from Cold Spring Harbor  Stanford  Austin    I won't even go through and name all the places    to have a research project that will last for five years where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this. We're doing it in mice first  and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this  but they will die for a good cause. And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand  when cancer happens  what's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer. So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future. So I think eventually  once we have one of these models for people  which we'll get eventually    I mean  our group won't get all the way there    but eventually we'll have a very good computer model    sort of like a global climate model for weather. It has lots of different information about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales. And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer    and this also will be for ALS  or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases  things like that    we will simulate specifically you  not just a generic person  but what's actually going on inside you. And in that simulation  what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments  and it might be very gentle treatments  very small amounts of drugs. It might be things like  don't eat that day  or give them a little chemotherapy  maybe a little radiation. Of course  we'll do surgery sometimes and so on. But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health    guide your body back to health. Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong. We put it in the equivalent of splints. And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer  and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job. And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future. It's going to require a lot of work  a lot of research. There will be many teams like our team that work on this. But I think eventually  we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer. So thank you very much. Ten years ago exactly  I was in Afghanistan. I was covering the war in Afghanistan  and I witnessed  as a reporter for Al Jazeera  the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that. Then  two years later  I covered another war    the war in Iraq. I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq. And the war ended with a regime change  like the one in Afghanistan. And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship  an authoritarian regime  that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation  within the people themselves. However  the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world. For decades  we have lived under authoritarian regimes    in the Arab world  in the Middle East. These regimes created something within us during this period. I'm    years old right now. For the last    years  I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us    old  aged  authoritarian  corrupt situations    regimes that we have seen around us. And for a moment I was wondering  are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground  a change that does not come through foreign intervention  through the misery of occupation  through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes  The Iraqis  yes  they got rid of Saddam Hussein  but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad  they felt that their dignity had suffered. And this is why they revolted. This is why they did not accept. And actually other regimes  they told their citizens   Would you like to see the situation of Iraq  Would you like to see civil war  sectarian killing  Would you like to see destruction  Would you like to see foreign troops on your land   And the people thought for themselves   Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in  instead of having the second scenario.  That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen. For    years  unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction  images of killing  of sectarian conflicts  images of violence  emerging from a magnificent piece of land  a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years. Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived. A new generation  well educated  connected  inspired by universal values and a global understanding  has created a new reality for us. We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams  these young people who have restored self confidence in our nations in that part of the world  who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets. Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing. Just step out of your house  raise your voice and say   We would like to see the end of the regime.  This is what happened in Tunisia. Over a few days  the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies  billions of dollars in maintaining  trying to maintain  its prisons  collapsed  disappeared  because of the voices of the public. People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices  they tried to kill. The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people. They found something called Facebook. They found something called Twitter. They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues. And they said   These kids are misled.  Therefore  they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them  bring them back home. This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.  Bring these kids home because they are misled.  But yes  these youth who have been inspired by universal values  who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and  at the same time  realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it    not using violence  not trying to create chaos    these young people  they did not go home. Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them. And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia. We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years  and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there. But we found that these people in the street  all of them are our reporters  feeding our newsroom with pictures  with videos and with news. And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people    people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority. And then we took that decision  We are unrolling the news. We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people. We are going to spread the message. Yes  some of these young people are connected to the Internet  but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little  is very small  because of many problems that we are suffering from. But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified  it . We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world    and internationally  globally  through our English channel. And then people started to feel that there's something new happening. And then Zine al Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave. And then Egypt started  and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave. And now Libya as you see it. And then you have Yemen. And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of   How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant   I want to tell you something  that the Internet and connectivity has created  a  new mindset. But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from. And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change  before we thought  and governments told us    and even sometimes it was true    that change was imposed on us  and people rejected that  because they thought that it is alien to their culture. Always  we believed that change will spring from within  that change should be a reconciliation with culture  cultural diversity  with our faith in our tradition and in our history  but at the same time  open to universal values  connected with the world  tolerant to the outside. And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world. This is the right moment  and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region. How did the elite deal with that    the so called political elite  In front of Facebook  they brought the camels in Tahrir Square. In front of Al Jazeera  they started creating tribalism. And then when they failed  they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world. They started telling the West   Be aware of Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is taking over our territories. These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras. Be aware of these people who  are  coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization.  Fortunately  people right now cannot be deceived. Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception. They could not  and they cannot  imagine how they could really deal with this reality. They have lost. They have been detached from their people  from the masses  and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other. Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution. We do not create revolutions. However  when something of that magnitude happens  we are at the center of the coverage. We were banned from Egypt  and our correspondents  some of them were arrested. But most of our camera people and our journalists  they went underground in Egypt    voluntarily    to report what happened in Tahrir Square. For    days  our cameras were broadcasting  live  the voices of the people in Tahrir Square. I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone    ordinary person who I don't know    from Tahrir Square. He told me   We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras. If you switch off the cameras tonight  there will be a genocide. You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square.  I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them   Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night  because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story    and they feel protected as well.  So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world. We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world. Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran  of  the  Mosaddeq revolution. Let us free ourselves    especially in the West    from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest  or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security. The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction. Let us accept the choice of the people. Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future. The future should be ruled by people themselves  even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us. But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world  for the West and the East  to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world  rather than the images of violence and terrorism. Let us support these people. Let us stand for them. And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change  and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance. The future has arrived  and the future is now. I thank you very much. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I just have a couple of questions for you. Thank you for coming here. How would you characterize the historical significance of what's happened  Is this a story of the year  a story of the decade or something more  Wadah Khanfar  Actually  this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered. We have covered many wars. We have covered a lot of tragedies  a lot of problems  a lot of conflict zones  a lot of hot spots in the region  because we were centered at the middle of it. But this is a story    it is a great story  it is beautiful. It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident. You are witnessing change in history. You are witnessing the birth of a new era. And this is what the story's all about. CA  There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical  or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos. You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now  that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly  WK  And people actually  after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime  the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils  they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy  but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational  not to go out of order. In my opinion  these people are much more wiser than  not only the political elite  even the intellectual elite  even opposition leaders including political parties. At this moment in time  the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old    including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes. CA  We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way. What should people here at TED  here in the West  do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here  WK  I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world    that people care  people care about this great transformation. Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us  the head of Aljazeera.net  he told me that a       percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world. Fifty percent of it is coming from America. Because we discovered that people care  and people would like to know    they are receiving the stream through our Internet. Unfortunately in the United States  we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English. But I can tell you  this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling  universal feeling  of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us. CA  Well Wadah  a group of members of the TED community  TEDxCairo  are meeting as we speak. They've had some speakers there. I believe they've heard your talk. Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us. Thank you so much. Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris  and the phone rang and I heard   Hey  JR  you won the TED Prize     . You have to make a wish to save the world.  I was lost. I mean  I can't save the world. Nobody can. The world is fucked up. Come on  you have dictators ruling the world  population is growing by millions  there's no more fish in the sea  the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said  we're all becoming fat. Except maybe French people. Whatever. So I called back and I told her   Look  Amy  tell the TED guys I just won't show up. I can't do anything to save the world.  She said   Hey  JR  your wish is not to save the world  but to change the world.   Oh  all right.   That's cool.  I mean  technology  politics  business do change the world    not always in a good way  but they do. What about art  Could art change the world  I started when I was    years old. And at that time  I was not thinking about changing the world. I was doing graffiti    writing my name everywhere  using the city as a canvas. I was going in the tunnels of Paris  on the rooftops with my friends. Each trip was an excursion  was an adventure. It was like leaving our mark on society  to say   I was here   on the top of a building. So when I found a cheap camera on the subway  I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies    really small photos just that size. That's how  at    years old  I started pasting them. And I did my first  expo de rue   which means sidewalk gallery. And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising. I mean  the city's the best gallery I could imagine. I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people. I would control it directly with the public in the streets. So that's Paris. I would change    depending on the places I would go    the title of the exhibition. That's on the Champs Elysees. I was quite proud of that one. Because I was just    and I was just up there on the top of the Champs Elysees. Then when the photo left  the frame was still there. November       the streets are burning. A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris. Everyone was glued to the TV  watching disturbing  frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood. I mean  these kids  without control  throwing Molotov cocktails  attacking the cops and the firemen  looting everything they could in the shops. These were criminals  thugs  dangerous  destroying their own environment. And then I saw it    could it be possible     my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car    a pasting I'd done a year earlier    an illegal one    still there. I mean  these were the faces of my friends. I know those guys. All of them are not angels  but they're not monsters either. So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television. So I went back there with a    mm lens. It was the only one I had at that time. But with that lens  you have to be as close as    inches from the person. So you can do it only with their trust. So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet. They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves. And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name  age  even building number of these guys. A year later  the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. And we go from thug images  who've been stolen and distorted by the media  who's now proudly taking over his own image. That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. So could art change the world  A year later  I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict. I mean  at that time  trust me  they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. So with my friend Marco  we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. Are they so different  When we got there  we just went in the street  started talking with people everywhere  and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs    taxi driver  lawyer  cooks. Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment. Not a smile    that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel. They all accepted to be pasted next to the other. I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall. We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. We called the project Face   Face. The experts said   No way. The people will not accept. The army will shoot you  and Hamas will kidnap you.  We said   Okay  let's try and push as far as we can.  I love the way that people will ask me   How big will my photo be    It will be as big as your house.  When we did the wall  we did the Palestinian side. So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. And so Palestinians guys say   Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution.  So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. We did Face   Face with only six friends  two ladders  two brushes  a rented car  a camera and        square feet of paper. We had all sorts of help from all walks of life. Okay  for example  that's Palestine. We're in Ramallah right now. We're pasting portraits    so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market. People come around us and start asking   What are you doing here    Oh  we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job. And those ones are actually two taxi drivers.  And then there was always a silence.  You mean you're pasting an Israeli face    doing a face    right here    Well  yeah  yeah  that's part of the project.  And I would always leave that moment  and we would ask them   So can you tell me who is who   And most of them couldn't say. We even pasted on Israeli military towers  and nothing happened. When you paste an image  it's just paper and glue. People can tear it  tag on it  or even pee on it    some are a bit high for that  I agree    but the people in the street  they are the curator. The rain and the wind will take them off anyway. They are not meant to stay. But exactly four years after  the photos  most of them are still there. Face   Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible    and  you know what  even easy. We didn't push the limit  we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. In the Middle East  I experienced my work in places without  many  museums. So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting. So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums. When you go in these developing societies  women are the pillars of their community  but the men are still the ones holding the streets. So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos. I called that project Women Are Heroes. When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents  I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict. I just observed. Sometimes there was no words  no sentence  just tears. I just took their pictures and pasted them. Women Are Heroes took me around the world. Most of the places I went to  I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media. So for example  in June       I was watching TV in Paris  and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro    the first favela of Brazil named Providencia. Three kids    that was three students    were  detained  by the army because they were not carrying their papers. And the army took them  and instead of bringing them to the police station  they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. I was shocked. All Brazil was shocked. I heard it was one of the most violent favelas  because the largest drug cartel controls it. So I decided to go there. When I arrived    I mean  I didn't have any contact with any NGO. There was none in place    no association  no NGOs  nothing    no eyewitnesses. So we just walked around  and we met a woman  and I showed her my book. And she said   You know what  We're hungry for culture. We need culture out there.  So I went out and I started with the kids. I just took a few photos of the kids  and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. The day after  I came back and they were already scratched. But that's okay. I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them. Then the next day  I held a meeting on the main square and some women came. They were all linked to the three kids that got killed. There was the mother  the grandmother  the best friend    they all wanted to shout the story. After that day  everyone in the favela gave me the green light. I took more photos  and we started the project. The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place  so I told them   You know what  I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons. You see that enough in the media. What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. I've been seeing it around me the last few days.  So that's a really symbolic pasting  because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city. And that's where the three kids got arrested  and that's the grandmother of one of them. And on that stairs  that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire. Everyone there understood the project. And then we pasted everywhere    the whole hill. What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. I mean  you should see that. They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens  and we would see ourselves  on TV  pasting. And they would put a number   Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia.  We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know. So how can we know about the project  So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them. So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women. We kept traveling. We went to Africa  Sudan  Sierra Leone  Liberia  Kenya. In war torn places like Monrovia  people come straight to you. I mean  they want to know what you're up to. They kept asking me   What is the purpose of your project  Are you an NGO  Are you the media   Art. Just doing art. Some people question   Why is it in black and white  Don't you have color in France   Or they tell you   Are these people all dead   Some who understood the project would explain it to others. And to a man who did not understand  I heard someone say   You know  you've been here for a few hours trying to understand  discussing with your fellows. During that time  you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow. This is art.  I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects. And then it becomes more. It becomes a desire  a need  an armor. On this bridge that's in Monrovia  ex rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war. Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict. This is Kibera  Kenya  one of the largest slums of Africa. You might have seen images about the post election violence that happened there in     . This time we covered the roofs of the houses  but we didn't use paper  because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house    vinyl does. Then art becomes useful. So the people kept it. You know what I love is  for example  when you see the biggest eye there  there are so  many  houses inside. And I went there a few months ago    photos are still there    and it was missing a piece of the eye. So I asked the people what happened.  Oh  that guy just moved.  When the roofs were covered  a woman said as a joke   Now God can see me.  When you look at Kibera now  they look back. Okay  India. Before I start that  just so you know  each time we go to a place  we don't have authorization  so we set up like commandos    we're a group of friends who arrive there  and we try to paste on the walls. But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. In India it was just impossible to paste. I heard culturally and because of the law  they would just arrest us at the first pasting. So we decided to paste white  white on the walls. So imagine white guys pasting white papers. So people would come to us and ask us   Hey  what are you up to    Oh  you know  we're just doing art.   Art   Of course  they were confused. But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets  and the more dust you would have going up in the air  on the white paper you can almost see  but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. So the more dust you have  the more it will reveal the photo. So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. Thank you. So we didn't get caught this time. Each project    that's a film from Women Are Heroes. Okay. For each project we do a film. And most of what you see    that's a trailer from  Women Are Heroes     its images  photography  taken one after the other. And the photos kept traveling even without us. Hopefully  you'll see the film  and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos. Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo. Behind each image is a story. Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities  and the women kept that dynamic after we left. For example  we did books    not for sale    that all the community would get. But to get it  they would have to  get  it signed by one of the women. We did that in most of the places. We go back regularly. And so in Providencia  for example  in the favela  we have a cultural center running there. In Kibera  each year we cover more roofs. Because of course  when we left  the people who were just at the edge of the project said   Hey  what about my roof   So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project. A really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors. So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects. And that is for me one of the more important things in the work. I think  today  as important as the result is the way you do things. And that has always been a central part of the work. And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising. We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum. But yesterday the city called them and said   Look  you're going to have to tear it down. Because this can be taken for advertising  and because of the law  it has to be taken down.  But tell me  advertising for what  The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community. But they asked me for a promise basically. They asked me   Please  make our story travel with you.  So I did. That's Paris. That's Rio. In each place  we built exhibitions with a story  and the story traveled. You understand the full scope of the project. That's London. New York. And today  they are with you in Long Beach. All right  recently I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore. I use Man Ray  Helen Levitt  Giacomelli  other people's artwork. It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not. The importance is what you do with the images  the statement it makes where it's pasted. So for example  I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country. This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally  and I pasted it in Southern Italy  where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground. In some ways  art can change the world. Art is not supposed to change the world  to change practical things  but to change perceptions. Art can change the way we see the world. Art can create an analogy. Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions  and then enables you to change the world. When I do my work  I have two kinds of reactions. People say   Oh  why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan. They would be really useful.  Or   How can we help   I presume that you belong to the second category  and that's good  because for that project  I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them. So now my wish is  I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project  and together we'll turn the world inside out. And this starts right now. Yes  everyone in the room. Everyone watching. I wanted that wish to actually start now. So a subject you're passionate about  a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos    tell me what you stand for. Take the photos  the portraits  upload it    I'll give you all the details    and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world. The full data is on the website    insideoutproject.net    that is launching today. What we see changes who we are. When we act together  the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts. So I hope that  together  we'll create something that the world will remember. And this starts right now and depends on you. Thank you. Thank you. This is Revolution  . . No one was a hero. No one was a hero. Because everyone was a hero. Everyone has done something. We all use Wikipedia. If you think of the concept of Wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content  and at the end of the day you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world. From just an idea that sounded crazy  you have the largest encyclopedia in the world. And in the Egyptian revolution  the Revolution  .   everyone has contributed something  small or big. They contributed something    to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions. It was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing. If you look at the scene  Egypt  for    years  had been in a downhill    going into a downhill. Everything was going bad. Everything was going wrong. We only ranked high when it comes to poverty  corruption  lack of freedom of speech  lack of political activism. Those were the achievements of our great regime. Yet  nothing was happening. And it's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated. In fact  people were extremely frustrated. But the reason why everyone was silent is what I call the psychological barrier of fear. Everyone was scared. Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians that I have to thank for being so brave    going into protests as a couple of hundred  getting beaten up and arrested. But in fact  the majority were scared. Everyone did not want really to get in trouble. A dictator cannot live without the force. They want to make people live in fear. And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years  and here comes the Internet  technology  BlackBerry  SMS. It's helping all of us to connect. Platforms like YouTube  Twitter  Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that   Wow  I'm not alone. There are a lot of people who are frustrated.  There are lots of people who are frustrated. There are lots of people who actually share the same dream. There are lots of people who care about their freedom. They probably have the best life in the world. They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas. They are happy. They don't have problems. But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian. A lot of us  we're not really happy when we see a video of an Egyptian man who's eating the trash while others are stealing billions of Egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country. The Internet has played a great role  helping these people to speak up their minds  to collaborate together  to start thinking together. It was an educational campaign. Khaled Saeed was killed in June     . I still remember the photo. I still remember every single detail of that photo. The photo was horrible. He was tortured  brutally tortured to death. But then what was the answer of the regime   He choked on a pile of hash     that was their answer   He's a criminal. He's someone who escaped from all these bad things.  But people did not relate to this. People did not believe this. Because of the Internet  the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth. And everyone started to think that  this guy could be my brother.  He was a middle class guy. His photo was remembered by all of us. A page was created. An anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page  and there was no plan.  What are we going to do    I don't know.  In a few days  tens of thousands of people there    angry Egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs   Enough. Get those who killed this guy. To just bring them to justice.  But of course  they don't listen. It was an amazing story    how everyone started feeling the ownership. Everyone was an owner in this page. People started contributing ideas. In fact  one of the most ridiculous ideas was   Hey  let's have a silent stand. Let's get people to go in the street  face the sea  their back to the street  dressed in black  standing up silently for one hour  doing nothing and then just leaving  going back home.  For some people  that was like   Wow  silent stand. And next time it's going to be vibration.  People were making fun of the idea. But actually when people went to the street    the first time it was thousands of people in Alexandria    it felt like    it was amazing. It was great because it connected people from the virtual world  bringing them to the real world  sharing the same dream  the same frustration  the same anger  the same desire for freedom. And they were doing this thing. But did the regime learn anything  Not really. They were actually attacking them. They were actually abusing them  despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were    they were not even protesting. And things had developed until the Tunisian revolution. This whole page was  again  managed by the people. In fact  the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas  help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing. People were taking shots and photos  people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt  people were suggesting ideas  they were actually voting on ideas  and then they were executing the ideas  people were creating videos. Everything was done by the people to the people  and that's the power of the Internet. There was no leader. The leader was everyone on that page. The Tunisian experiment  as Amir was saying  inspired all of us  showed us that there is a way. Yes we can. We can do it. We have the same problems  we can just go in the streets. And when I saw the street on the   th  I went back and said   Egypt before the   th is never going to be Egypt after the   th. The revolution is happening. This is not the end  this is the beginning of the end.  I was detained on the   th night. Thank God I announced the locations and everything. But they detained me. And I'm not going to talk about my experience  because this is not about me. I was detained for    days  blindfolded  handcuffed. And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything. I was not allowed to speak with anyone. And I went out. The next day I was in Tahrir. Seriously  with the amount of change I had noticed in this square  I thought it was    years. I never had in my mind to see this Egyptian  the amazing Egyptian. The fear is no longer fear. It's actually strength    it's power. People were so empowered. It was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights. Completely opposite. Extremism became tolerance. Who would  have  imagined before the   th  if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them  and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them    this is amazing. All the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so called propaganda  or mainstream media  are proven wrong. This whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the Egyptian man  the Egyptian woman  how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream. When I saw that  I went back and I wrote on Facebook. And that was a personal belief  regardless of what's going on  regardless of the details. I said that   We are going to win. We are going to win because we don't understand politics. We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games. We're going to win because we don't have an agenda. We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. We're going to win because we have dreams. We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams.  And that's actually what happened. We won. And that's not because of anything  but because we believed in our dream. The winning here is not the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene. The winning is the winning of the dignity of every single Egyptian. Actually  I had this taxi driver telling me   Listen  I am breathing freedom. I feel that I have dignity that I have lost for so many years.  For me that's winning  regardless of all the details. My last word to you is a statement I believe in  which Egyptians have proven to be true  that the power of the people is much stronger than the people in power. Thanks a lot. Well  this is about state budgets. This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning. But I want to tell you  I think it's an important topic that we need to care about. State budgets are big  big money    I'll show you the numbers    and they get very little scrutiny. The understanding is very low. Many of the people involved have special interests or short term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are. And these budgets are the key for our future  they're the key for our kids. Most education funding    whether it's K through     or the great universities or community colleges    most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets. But we have a problem. Here's the overall picture. U.S. economy is big      .  trillion. Now out of that pie  the government spends    percent. So this is combining the federal level  which is the largest  the state level and the local level. And it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on  because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries. But we're spending    percent. Well what are we taking in  Simple business question. Answer is    percent. Now this leaves    percent deficit  sort of a mind blowing number. And some of that  in fact  is due to the fact that we've had an economic recession. Receipts go down  some spending programs go up  but most of it is not because of that. Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends  and that creates a huge challenge. In fact  this is the forecast picture. There are various things in here  I could say we might raise more revenue  or medical innovation will make the spending even higher. It is an increasingly difficult picture  even assuming the economy does quite well    probably better than it will do. This is what you see at this overall level. Now how did we get here  How could you have a problem like this  After all  at least on paper  there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced. Only one state says they don't have to balance the budget. But what this means actually is that there's a pretense. There's no real  true balancing going on  and in a sense  the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straight forward challenges. When Jerry Brown was elected  this was the challenge that was put to him. That is  through various gimmicks and things  a so called balanced budget had led him to have    billion missing out of the    billion in proposed spending. Now he's put together some thoughts  About half of that he'll cut  another half  perhaps in a very complex set of steps  taxes will be approved. But even so  as you go out into those future years  various pension costs  health costs go up enough  and the revenue does not go up enough. So you get a big squeeze. What were those things that allowed us to hide this  Well  some really nice little tricks. And these were somewhat noticed. The paper said   It's not really balanced. It's got holes. It perpetuates deficit spending. It's riddled with gimmicks.  And really when you get down to it  the guys at Enron never would have done this. This is so blatant  so extreme. Is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do  They borrow money. They're not supposed to  but they figure out a way. They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out. They sell off the assets. They defer the payments. They sell off the revenues from tobacco. And California's not unique. In fact  there's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don't face this big challenge. So it's systemic across the entire country. It really comes from the fact that certain long term obligations    health care  where innovation makes it more expensive  early retirement and pension  where the age structure gets worse for you  and just generosity    that these mis accounting things allow to develop over time  that you've got a problem. This is the retiree health care benefits. Three million set aside     billion dollar liability    much worse than the car companies. And everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem. The forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from    percent of the budget to    percent. Well what's going to give  Well in order to accommodate that  you would have to cut education spending in half. It really is this young versus the old to some degree. If you don't change that revenue picture  if you don't solve what you're doing in health care  you're going to be deinvesting in the young. The great University of California university system  the great things that have gone on  won't happen. So far it's meant layoffs  increased class sizes. Within the education community there's this discussion of   Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off  or the less good teachers who get laid off   And there's a discussion  if you're going to increase class sizes  where do you do that  How much effect does that have  And unfortunately  as you get into that  people get confused and think  well maybe you think that's okay. In fact  no  education spending should not be cut. There's ways  if it's temporary  to minimize the impact  but it's a problem. It's also really a problem for where we need to go. Technology has a role to play. Well we need money to experiment with that  to get those tools in there. There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness  measuring them  giving them feedback  taking videos in the classroom. That's something I think is very  very important. Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay. In a situation where you have growth  you put the new money into this. Or even if you're flat  you might shift money into it. But with the type of cuts we're talking about  it will be far  far harder to get these incentives for excellence  or to move over to use technology in the new way. So what's going on  Where's the brain trust that's in error here  Well there really is no brain trust. It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up. Just look at this spending. California will spend over     billion  Microsoft      Google  about   . The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis  both inside Google and Microsoft and outside  with analysts and people of various opinions    should they have spent on that  No  they wasted their money on this. What about this thing     it really is quite phenomenal. Everybody has an opinion. There's great feedback. And the numbers are used to make decisions. If you go over the education spending and the health care spending    particularly these long term trends    you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity  in terms of learning. So what do we need to do  We need better tools. We can get some things out on the Internet. I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture. We need lots more. There's a few good books  one about school spending and where the money comes from    how that's changed over time  and the challenge. We need better accounting. We need to take the fact that the current employees  the future liabilities they create  that should come out of the current budget. We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have. It should be more like private accounting. It's the gold standard. And finally  we need to really reward politicians. Whenever they say there's these long term problems  we can't say   Oh  you're the messenger with bad news  We just shot you.  In fact  there are some like these  Erskine Bowles  Alan Simpson and others  who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health spending state level problem. But in fact  their work was sort of pushed off. In fact  the week afterwards  some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions. So we need these pieces. Now I think this is a solvable problem. It's a great country with lots of people. But we have to draw those people in  because this is about education. And just look at what happened with the tuitions with the University of California and project that out for another three  four  five years    it's unaffordable. And that's the kind of thing    the investment in the young    that makes us great  allows us to contribute. It allows us to do the art  the biotechnology  the software and all those magic things. And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future. Thank you. There's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs. The fact is that we're living longer. Medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer  and the problem is  as we age  our organs tend to fail more  and so currently there are not enough organs to go around. In fact  in the last    years  the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled  while in the same time  the actual number of transplants has barely gone up. So this is now a public health crisis. So that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine. It really involves many different areas. You can use  actually  scaffolds  biomaterials    they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt    but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate. Or we can use cells alone  either your very own cells or different stem cell populations. Or we can use both. We can use  actually  biomaterials and the cells together. And that's where the field is today. But it's actually not a new field. Interestingly  this is a book that was published back in     . It's titled  The Culture of Organs.  The first author  Alexis Carrel  a Nobel Prize winner. He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels  and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis. But I want you to note his co author  Charles Lindbergh. That's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs. So if the field's been around for so long  why so few clinical advances  And that really has to do to many different challenges. But if I were to point to three challenges  the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time. And many advances now  we can do that fairly readily. The second challenge was cells. We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body. Over the last    years  we've basically tackled that. Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells. Plus we have stem cells. But even now        there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient. Liver cells  nerve cells  pancreatic cells    we still can't grow them even today. And the third challenge is vascularity  the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them. So we can actually use biomaterials now. This is actually a biomaterial. We can weave them  knit them  or we can make them like you see here. This is actually like a cotton candy machine. You saw the spray going in. That was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure  this tubularized structure  which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so. And that's exactly what we did here. This is actually a patient who  was  presented with a deceased organ  and we then created one of these smart biomaterials  and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient's structure. What we did was we actually used the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge  if you will  and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue. And you see that patient now six months after with an X ray showing you the regenerated tissue  which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope. We can also use cells alone. These are actually cells that we obtained. These are stem cells that we create from specific sources  and we can drive them to become heart cells  and they start beating in culture. So they know what to do. The cells genetically know what to do  and they start beating together. Now today  many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease. So that's actually now in patients. Or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures  we can then use the patient's own cells  or some cell population  and the biomaterials  the scaffolds  together. So the concept here  so if you do have a deceased or injured organ  we take a very small piece of that tissue  less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the cells apart  we grow the cells outside the body. We then take a scaffold  a biomaterial    again  looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt    we then shape that material  and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time    very much like baking a layer cake  if you will. We then place it in an oven like device  and we're able to create that structure and bring it out. This is actually a heart valve that we've engineered  and you can see here  we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seeded that with cells  and then we exercise it. So you see the leaflets opening and closing    of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies. Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders. We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient    less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then grow the cells outside the body  take the scaffold  coat the scaffold with the cells    the patient's own cells  two different cell types. We then put it in this oven like device. It has the same conditions as the human body       degrees centigrade     percent oxygen. A few weeks later  you have your engineered organ that we're able to implant back into the patient. For these specific patients  we actually just suture these materials. We use three dimensional imagining analysis  but we actually created these biomaterials by hand. But we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells. We use now some type of technologies  where for solid organs  for example  like the liver  what we do is we take discard livers. As you know  a lot of organs are actually discarded  not used. So we can take these liver structures  which are not going to be used  and we then put them in a washing machine like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away. Two weeks later  you have something that looks like a liver. You can hold it like a liver  but it has no cells  it's just a skeleton of the liver. And we then can re perfuse the liver with cells  preserving the blood vessel tree. So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells  and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells. And we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology. Another technology that we've used is actually that of printing. This is actually a desktop inkjet printer  but instead of using ink  we're using cells. And you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure  and it takes about    minutes to print this structure. And there's a  D elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through. And then finally you're able to get that structure out. You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it. And this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here. That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques. Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now  our next generation of technologies  are more sophisticated printers. This particular printer we're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient. So what you see here    I know it sounds funny  but that's the way it works. Because in reality  what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound  and you have a scanner  basically like a flatbed scanner. That's what you see here on the right side. You see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves. This is how it actually works. Here's the scanner going through  scanning the wound. Once it's scanned  it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be. And now you're going to see here a demo of this actually being done in a representative wound. And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material. So once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be. And this is actually new technology still under development. We're also working on more sophisticated printers. Because in reality  our biggest challenge are the solid organs. I don't know if you realize this  but    percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney. Patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around. So this is more challenging    large organ  vascular  a lot of blood vessel supply  a lot of cells present. So the strategy here is    this is actually a CT scan  an X ray    and we go layer by layer  using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and  D reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys. We then are able to actually image those  do     degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics  and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form. So we go layer by layer through the organ  analyzing each layer as we go through the organ  and we then are able to send that information  as you see here  through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient. This actually shows the actual printer. And this actually shows that printing. In fact  we actually have the printer right here. So while we've been talking today  you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage. That's actually the actual printer right now  and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here. It takes about seven hours to print a kidney  so this is about three hours into it now. And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now  and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today. Put a pair of gloves here. Thank you. Go backwards. So  these gloves are a little bit small on me  but here it is. You can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today. Has a little bit of consistency to it. This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project  and part of our team. Thank you  Dr. Kang. I appreciate it. So this is actually a new generation. This is actually the printer that you see here onstage. And this is actually a new technology we're working on now. In reality  we now have a long history of doing this. I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while. And this is actually a very brief clip    only about    seconds    of a patient who actually received an organ. I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable. I couldn't go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside. I felt so sick. I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis  and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that. So after the surgery  life got a lot better for me. I was able to do more things. I was able to wrestle in high school. I became the captain of the team  and that was great. I was able to be a normal kid with my friends. And because they used my own cells to build this bladder  it's going to be with me. I've got it for life  so I'm all set. Juan Enriquez  These experiments sometimes work  and it's very cool when they do. Luke  come up please. So Luke  before last night  when's the last time you saw Tony  LM  Ten years ago  when I had my surgery    and it's really great to see him. JE  And tell us a little bit about what you're doing. LM  Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut. I'm a sophomore and studying communications  TV and mass media  and basically trying to live life like a normal kid  which I always wanted growing up. But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working. I went through about    surgeries  and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was   . And this surgery came along and basically made me who I am today and saved my life. JE  And Tony's done hundreds of these  LM  What I know from  he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff. I know I was one of the first    people to have this surgery. And when I was     I didn't realize how amazing it was. I was a little kid  and I was like   Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery.  All I wanted to do was to get better  and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing. JE  When you got this call out of the blue    Tony's really shy  and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke. So Luke  you go to your communications professors    you're majoring in communications    and you ask them for permission to come to TED  which might have a little bit to do with communications  and what was their reaction  LM  Most of my professors were all for it  and they said   Bring pictures and show me the clips online   and  I'm happy for you.  There were a couple that were a little stubborn  but I had to talk to them. I pulled them aside. JE  Well  it's an honor and a privilege to meet you. Thank you so much.  LM  Thank you so much.  JE  Thank you  Tony. So I was born on the last day of the last year of the '  s. I was raised on  Free to be you and me     hip hop    not as many woohoos for hip hop in the house. Thank you. Thank you for hip hop    and Anita Hill. My parents were radicals    who became  well  grown ups. My dad facetiously says   We wanted to save the world  and instead we just got rich.  We actually just got  middle class  in Colorado Springs  Colorado  but you get the picture. I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy. At this ripe old age of     I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible  beautiful time  and I've decided  for me  it's been a real journey and paradox. The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it. Feminism was the water I grew up in. When I was just a little girl  my mom started what is now the longest running women's film festival in the world. So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons  I was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women. You can see how this had an influence. But she was not the only feminist in the house. My dad actually resigned from the male only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son  but not his daughter. He's actually here today. The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet  not a businessman  but the intention was really good. In any case  I didn't readily claim the feminist label  even though it was all around me  because I associated it with my mom's women's groups  her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads    none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time. But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing  so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them    never  of course  admitting that I was doing so. I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time. They were the co authors of a book called  Manifesta.  So what very profound epiphany  you might ask  was responsible for my feminist click moment  Fishnet stockings. Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them. I thought they were really hot. I decided  okay  I can claim the feminist label. Now I tell you this    I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself  because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics  that beauty  that fun do matter. There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness. Anyone heard of these two guys as an example  So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's  but it looks very different. My mom says   patriarchy.  I say   intersectionality.  So race  class  gender  ability  all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman. Pay equity  Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue. But for me  so is immigration.  Applause  Thank you. My mom says   Protest march.  I say   Online organizing.  I co edit  along with a collective of other super smart  amazing women  a site called Feministing.com. We are the most widely read feminist publication ever  and I tell you this because I think it's really important to see that there's a continuum. Feminist blogging is basically the   st century version of consciousness raising. But we also have a straightforward political impact. Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart. We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate mail fired from a Big Ten school. And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say   I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site. I realized feminism wasn't about man hating and Birkenstocks.  So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way. My mom says   Gloria Steinem.  I say   Samhita Mukhopadhyay  Miriam Perez  Ann Friedman  Jessica Valenti  Vanessa Valenti  and on and on and on and on.  We don't want one hero. We don't want one icon. We don't want one face. We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing  community organizing  changing institutions from the inside out    all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started. Thank you. Which brings me to the second paradox  sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once. Many in my generation    because of well intentioned parenting and self esteem education    were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes    who were going to go out and save the world. These are three words many of us were raised with. We walk across graduation stages  high on our overblown expectations  and when we float back down to earth  we realize we don't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway. The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic  and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed. And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about  to be fair    an environmental crisis  wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since       and globally  a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity. Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls. It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed. I experienced this firsthand myself when I graduated from Barnard College in     . I was fired up  I was ready to make a difference. I went out and I worked at a non profit  I went to grad school  I phone banked  I protested  I volunteered  and none of it seemed to matter. And on a particularly dark night of December of       I sat down with my family  and I said that I had become very disillusioned. I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy    kind of a dark fantasy    of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps. My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze  her eyes really welled with tears  and she looked right at me and she said   I will not stand for your desperation.  She said   You are smarter  more creative and more resilient than that.  Which brings me to my third paradox. Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well. There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by  Parker Palmer  and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed  between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves.  You may have guessed by now  I did not light myself on fire. I did what I know to do in desperation  which is write. I wrote the book I needed to read. I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work. I wrote about Nia Martin Robinson  the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists  who's dedicating her life to environmental justice. I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do  but quickly learned  not only did she not like it  but she wasn't really good at it. Instead  what she really wanted to do was make films. So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact. I wrote about Maricela Guzman  the daughter of Mexican immigrants  who joined the military so she could afford college. She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network. What I learned from these people and others was that I couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals. Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems    the military  congress  the education system  etc. But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force. And at the end of the day  what could possibly be more important than that  Cornel West says   Of course it's a failure. But how good a failure is it   This isn't to say we give up our wildest  biggest dreams. It's to say we operate on two levels. On one  we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part. But on the other  we root our self esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day more kind  more just  etc. So when I was a little girl  I had a couple of very strange habits. One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home  and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand. I was listening to her talk on the phone  which she did a lot. She was talking about board meetings  she was founding peace organizations  she was coordinating carpools  she was consoling friends    all these daily acts of care and creativity. And surely  at three and four years old  I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice  but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work. The activists I interviewed had nothing in common  literally  except for one thing  which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences. So often  particularly at a young age  we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life  and sometimes they're in our own kitchens  talking on the phone  making us dinner  doing all that keeps the world going around and around. My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory  or certainty  or security even. It's about embracing the paradox. It's about acting in the face of overwhelm. And it's about loving people really well. And at the end of the day  these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward. Thank you. Khan Academy is most known for its collection of videos  so before I go any further  let me show you a little bit of a montage. This animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America    a nice clean band here    and this part of Africa. We can integrate over the surface  and the notation usually is a capital sigma. National Assembly  They create the Committee of Public Safety  which sounds like a very nice committee. Notice  this is an aldehyde  and it's an alcohol. Start differentiating into effector and memory cells. A galaxy. Hey  There's another galaxy. Oh  look  There's another galaxy. And for dollars  is their    million  plus the    million dollars from the American manufacturer. If this does not blow your mind  then you have no emotion. covering everything from basic arithmetic  all the way to vector calculus  and some of the stuff that you saw up there. We have a million students a month using the site  watching on the order of     to         videos a day. But what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level. But before I do that  I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started. And some of you all might know  about five years ago  I was an analyst at a hedge fund  and I was in Boston  and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans  remotely. And I started putting the first YouTube videos up  really just as a kind of nice to have  just kind of a supplement for my cousins  something that might give them a refresher or something. And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up  something interesting happened. Actually  a bunch of interesting things happened. The first was the feedback from my cousins. They told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person. And once you get over the backhanded nature of that  there was actually something very profound there. They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin. At first it's very unintuitive  but when you think about it from their point of view  it makes a ton of sense. You have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin  without feeling like they're wasting my time. If they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago  or maybe a couple of years ago  they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin. They can just watch those videos  if they're bored  they can go ahead. They can watch at their own time and pace. Probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around a new concept  the very last thing you need is another human being saying   Do you understand this   And that's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before  and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room. The other thing that happened is    I put them on YouTube just    I saw no reason to make it private  so I let other people watch it  and then people started stumbling on it  and I started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people around the world. These are just a few. This is actually from one of the original calculus videos. Someone wrote it on YouTube  it was a YouTube comment   First time I smiled doing a derivative.  Let's pause here. This person did a derivative  and then they smiled. In response to that same comment    this is on the thread  you can go on YouTube and look at the comments    someone else wrote   Same thing here. I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day  since I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class  and here I'm all like  'I know kung fu.'  We get a lot of feedback along those lines. This clearly was helping people. But then  as the viewership kept growing and kept growing  I started getting letters from people  and it was starting to become clear that it was more than just a nice to have. This is just an excerpt from one of those letters   My    year old son has autism  and has had a terrible time with math. We have tried everything  viewed everything  bought everything. We stumbled on your video on decimals  and it got through. Then we went on to the dreaded fractions. Again  he got it. We could not believe it. He is so excited.  And so you can imagine  here I was  an analyst at a hedge fund    it was very strange for me to do something of social value. But I was excited  so I kept going. And then a few other things started to dawn on me  that not only would it help my cousins right now  or these people who were sending letters  but that this content will never grow old  that it could help their kids or their grandkids. If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus  I wouldn't have to. Assuming he was good. We don't know. The other thing that happened    and even at this point  I said   OK  maybe it's a good supplement. It's good for motivated students. It's good for maybe home schoolers.  But I didn't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom. Then I started getting letters from teachers  and the teachers would write  saying   We've used your videos to flip the classroom. You've given the lectures  so now what we do     And this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow     what I do is I assign the lectures for homework  and what used to be homework  I now have the students doing in the classroom.  And I want to pause here    I want to pause here  because there's a couple of interesting things. One  when those teachers are doing that  there's the obvious benefit    the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did  they can pause  repeat at their own pace  at their own time. But the more interesting thing    and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom    by removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom  and letting students have a self paced lecture at home  then when you go to the classroom  letting them do work  having the teacher walk around  having the peers actually be able to interact with each other  these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience       kids with their fingers on their lips  not allowed to interact with each other. A teacher  no matter how good  has to give this one size fits all lecture to    students    blank faces  slightly antagonistic    and now it's a human experience  now they're actually interacting with each other. So once the Khan Academy    I quit my job  and we turned into a real organization    we're a not for profit    the question is  how do we take this to the next level  How do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion  And so  what I'm showing over here  these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins. The ones I started were much more primitive. This is a more competent version of it. But the paradigm here is  we'll generate as many questions as you need  until you get that concept  until you get    in a row. And the Khan Academy videos are there. You get hints  the actual steps for that problem  if you don't know how to do it. The paradigm here seems like a very simple thing     in a row  you move on. But it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right now. In a traditional classroom  you have homework  lecture  homework  lecture  and then you have a snapshot exam. And that exam  whether you get a    percent  an    percent  a    percent or a    percent  the class moves on to the next topic. And even that    percent student    what was the five percent they didn't know  Maybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zeroth power. Then you build on that in the next concept. That's analogous to    imagine learning to ride a bicycle. Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time  and I give you a bicycle for two weeks  then I come back after two weeks  and say   Well  let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns. You can't quite stop. You're an    percent bicyclist.  So I put a big  C  stamp on your forehead    and then I say   Here's a unicycle.  But as ridiculous as that sounds  that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now. And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden  and start failing calculus all of the sudden  despite being smart  despite having good teachers  and it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation. So our model is  learn math the way you'd learn anything  like riding a bicycle. Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle. Do it as long as necessary  until you have mastery. The traditional model  it penalizes you for experimentation and failure  but it does not expect mastery. We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to fail. But we do expect mastery. This is just another one of the modules. This is trigonometry. This is shifting and reflecting functions. And they all fit together. We have about    of these right now. You can go to the site right now  it's all free  not trying to sell anything. But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map. That top node right there  that's literally single digit addition  it's like one plus one is equal to two. The paradigm is  once you get    in a row on that  it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules. Further down the knowledge map  we're getting into more advanced arithmetic. Further down  you start getting into pre algebra and early algebra. Further down  you start getting into algebra one  algebra two  a little bit of precalculus. And the idea is  from this we can actually teach everything    well  everything that can be taught in this type of a framework. So you can imagine    and this is what we are working on    from this knowledge map  you have logic  you have computer programming  you have grammar  you have genetics  all based off of that core of  if you know this and that  now you're ready for this next concept. Now that can work well for an individual learner  and I encourage you to do it with your kids  but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself. It'll change what happens at the dinner table. But what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about. And so what I'm showing you here  this is data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district  where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes  and completely gutted their old math curriculum. These kids aren't using textbooks  or getting one size fits all lectures. They're doing Khan Academy  that software  for roughly half of their math class. I want to be clear  we don't view this as a complete math education. What it does is    this is what's happening in Los Altos    it frees up time    it's the blocking and tackling  making sure you know how to move through a system of equations  and it frees up time for the simulations  for the games  for the mechanics  for the robot building  for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow. And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day  every kid works at their own pace    this is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district    and they look at this dashboard. Every row is a student. Every column is one of those concepts. Green means the student's already proficient. Blue means they're working on it    no need to worry. Red means they're stuck. And what the teacher does is literally just say   Let me intervene on the red kids.  Or even better   Let me get one of the green kids  who are already proficient in that concept  to be the first line of attack  and actually tutor their peer.  Now  I come from a very data centric reality  so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions   What don't you understand  What do you understand   and all the rest. So our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible    data that  in any other field  is expected  in finance  marketing  manufacturing    so the teachers can diagnose what's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible. Now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to  how long they've spent each day  what videos they've watched  when did they pause the videos  what did they stop watching  what exercises are they using  what have they focused on  The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on. The inner circle shows the videos they're focused on. The data gets pretty granular  so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong. Red is wrong  blue is right. The leftmost question is the first one the student attempted. They watched the video over there. And you can see  eventually they were able to get    in a row. It's almost like you can see them learning over those last    problems. They also got faster    the height is how long it took them. When you talk about self paced learning  it makes sense for everyone    in education speak   differentiated learning     but it's kind of crazy  what happens when you see it in a classroom. Because every time we've done this  in every classroom we've done  over and over again  if you go five days into it  there's a group of kids who've raced ahead and a group who are a little bit slower. In a traditional model  in a snapshot assessment  you say   These are the gifted kids  these are the slow kids. Maybe they should be tracked differently. Maybe we should put them in different classes.  But when you let students work at their own pace    we see it over and over again    you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other  but once they get through that concept  they just race ahead. And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago  you now would think are gifted. And we're seeing it over and over again. It makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time. Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos  our goal is to use technology to humanize  not just in Los Altos  but on a global scale  what's happening in education. And that brings up an interesting point. A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios. In our mind  the relevant metric is  student to valuable human time  with the teacher ratio. So in a traditional model  most of the teacher's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot. Maybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students and working with them. Now      percent of their time is. So once again  using technology  not just flipping the classroom  you're humanizing the classroom  I'd argue  by a factor of five or   . As valuable as that is in Los Altos  imagine what it does to the adult learner  who's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff they should have known before going back to college. Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta  who has to help his family during the day  and that's the reason he or she can't go to school. Now they can spend two hours a day and remediate  or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don't know. Now imagine what happens where    we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom. But this is all one system. There's no reason why you can't have that peer to peer tutoring beyond that one classroom. Imagine what happens if that student in Calcutta all of the sudden can tutor your son  or your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta. And I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one world classroom. And that's essentially what we're trying to build. Thank you. Bill Gates  I'll ask about two or three questions. Salman Khan  Oh  OK. BG  I've seen some things you're doing in the system  that have to do with motivation and feedback    energy points  merit badges. Tell me what you're thinking there. SK  Oh yeah. No  we have an awesome team working on it. I have to be clear  it's not just me anymore. I'm still doing all the videos  but we have a rock star team doing the software. We've put a bunch of game mechanics in there  where you get badges  we're going to start having leader boards by area  you get points. It's actually been pretty interesting. Just the wording of the badging  or how many points you get for doing something  we see on a system wide basis  like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another  depending what badge you give them. BG  And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos  how did that come about  SK  Los Altos  it was kind of crazy. Once again  I didn't expect it to be used in classrooms. Someone from their board came and said   What would you do if you had carte Blanche in a classroom   I said   Well  every student would work at their own pace  on something like this  we'd give a dashboard.  They said   This is kind of radical. We have to think about it.  Me and the rest of the team were like   They're never going to want to do this.  But literally the next day they were like   Can you start in two weeks   BG  So fifth grade math is where that's going on right now  SK  It's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes. They're doing it at the district level. I think what they're excited about is they can follow these kids  not only in school  on Christmas  we saw some of the kids were doing it. We can track everything  track them as they go through the entire district. Through the summers  as they go from one teacher to the next  you have this continuity of data that even at the district level  they can see. BG  So some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those kids. So you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need  SK  Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers. We made some of those for students so they could see their data  but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves. And they're saying   Hey  this is nice  but     Like that focus graph  a lot of the teachers said   I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic.  So we made that focus diagram. So it's all been teacher driven. It's been pretty crazy. BG  Is this ready for prime time  Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out  SK  Yeah  it's ready. We've got a million people on the site already  so we can handle a few more. No  no reason why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow. BG  And the vision of the tutoring thing. The idea there is  if I'm confused about a topic  somehow right in the user interface  I'd find people who are volunteering  maybe see their reputation  and I could schedule and connect up with those people  SK  Absolutely. And this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do. Those dashboards the teachers have  you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids  your nephews  your cousins  or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club. And yeah  you can start becoming a mentor  a tutor  really immediately. But yeah  it's all there. BG  Well  it's amazing. I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education. BG  Thank you. SK  Thank you. Imagine if you could record your life    everything you said  everything you did  available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips  so you could go back and find memorable moments and relive them  or sift through traces of time and discover patterns in your own life that previously had gone undiscovered. Well that's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago. This is my wife and collaborator  Rupal. And on this day  at this moment  we walked into the house with our first child  our beautiful baby boy. And we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system. Deb Roy  This moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house  if you looked up  you'd see a camera and a microphone  and if you looked down  you'd get this bird's eye view of the room. Here's our living room  the baby bedroom  kitchen  dining room and the rest of the house. And all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture. So here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening and  finally  lights out for the day. Over the course of three years  we recorded eight to    hours a day  amassing roughly a quarter million hours of multi track audio and video. So you're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made. And what this data represents for our family at a personal level  the impact has already been immense  and we're still learning its value. Countless moments of unsolicited natural moments  not posed moments  are captured there  and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them. But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project  which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language    that child being my son. And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data  we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set  trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition. So we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do. This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen  and as we move through space and through time  a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen. In order to convert this opaque         hours of video into something that we could start to see  we use motion analysis to pull out  as we move through space and through time  what we call space time worms. And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data  and with it  trace the pattern of  in particular  where my son moved throughout the home  so that we could focus our transcription efforts  all of the speech environment around my son    all of the words that he heard from myself  my wife  our nanny  and over time  the words he began to produce. So with that technology and that data and the ability to  with machine assistance  transcribe speech  we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts. And with that  let me take you now for a first tour into the data. So you've all  I'm sure  seen time lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time. I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form. My son  soon after his first birthday  would say  gaga  to mean water. And over the course of the next half year  he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form   water.  So we're going to cruise through half a year in about    seconds. No video here  so you can focus on the sound  the acoustics  of a new kind of trajectory  gaga to water. Gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water. DR  He sure nailed it  didn't he. So he didn't just learn water. Over the course of the    months  the first two years that we really focused on  this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order. And because we have full transcripts  we've identified each of the     words that he learned to produce by his second birthday. He was an early talker. And so we started to analyze why. Why were certain words born before others  This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us. The way to interpret this apparently simple graph is  on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances. And the  horizontal  axis is time. And all of the data  we aligned based on the following idea  Every time my son would learn a word  we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word. And we would plot the relative length of the utterances. And what we found was this curious phenomena  that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum  making language as simple as possible  and then slowly ascend back up in complexity. And the amazing thing was that bounce  that dip  lined up almost precisely with when each word was born    word after word  systematically. So it appears that all three primary caregivers    myself  my wife and our nanny    were systematically and  I would think  subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language. And the implications of this    there are many  but one I just want to point out  is that there must be amazing feedback loops. Of course  my son is learning from his linguistic environment  but the environment is learning from him. That environment  people  are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now. But that's looking at the speech context. What about the visual context  We're not looking at    think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house. We've taken those circular fish eye lens cameras  and we've done some optical correction  and then we can bring it into three dimensional life. So welcome to my home. This is a moment  one moment captured across multiple cameras. The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine  where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe video life into this system. What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of    minutes  again  of just life in the living room. That's me and my son on the floor. And there's video analytics that are tracking our movements. My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink. We're now on the couch  looking out through the window at cars passing by. And finally  my son playing in a walking toy by himself. Now we freeze the action     minutes  we turn time into the vertical axis  and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we've just left behind. And we see these amazing structures    these little knots of two colors of thread we call  social hot spots.  The spiral thread we call a  solo hot spot.  And we think that these affect the way language is learned. What we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned    so in other words  the relationship between words and what they're about in the world. So here's how we're approaching this. In this video  again  my son is being traced out. He's leaving red ink behind. And there's our nanny by the door. Nanny  All right.  Baby  Aaaa.  DR  She offers water  and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water. And what we've done is use the word  water  to tag that moment  that bit of activity. And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in  and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co occurred with an instance of water. And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape. We call these wordscapes. This is the wordscape for the word water  and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen. That's where those big peaks are over to the left. And just for contrast  we can do this with any word. We can take the word  bye  as in  good bye.  And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house. And we look  and we find  as you would expect  a contrast in the landscape where the word  bye  occurs much more in a structured way. So we're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition  and that's ongoing work now. In my lab  which we're peering into now  at MIT    this is at the media lab. This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space. Three of the key people in this project  Philip DeCamp  Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here. Philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you're seeing. And Michael Fleischman was another Ph.D. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis  and he made the following observation  that  just the way that we're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language  that same idea we can take out of your home  Deb  and we can apply it to the world of public media.  And so our effort took an unexpected turn. Think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place. We've started analyzing television content using the same principles    analyzing event structure of a TV signal    episodes of shows  commercials  all of the components that make up the event structure. And we're now  with satellite dishes  pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States. And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people's conversations  you just tune into publicly available social media feeds. So we're pulling in about three billion comments a month  and then the magic happens. You have the event structure  the common ground that the words are about  coming out of the television feeds  you've got the conversations that are about those topics  and through semantic analysis    and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing    each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal. And the same idea now can be built up. And we get this wordscape  except now words are not assembled in my living room. Instead  the context  the common ground activities  are the content on television that's driving the conversations. And what we're seeing here  these skyscrapers now  are commentary that are linked to content on television. Same concept  but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere. And so fundamentally  rather than  for example  measuring content based on how many people are watching  this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content. And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family  we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people. This is a subset of data from our database    just        out of several million    and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources. And if you put them on one plain  a second plain is where the content lives. So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials  and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph. And then the important third dimension. Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content. And there are  again  now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content. And we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways. So if we  for example  trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it  and then we follow where that comment goes  and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content  a very interesting structure becomes visible. We call this a co viewing clique  a virtual living room if you will. And there are fascinating dynamics at play. It's not one way. A piece of content  an event  causes someone to talk. They talk to other people. That drives tune in behavior back into mass media  and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior. Another example    very different    another actual person in our database    and we're finding at least hundreds  if not thousands  of these. We've given this person a name. This is a pro amateur  or pro am media critic who has this high fan out rate. So a lot of people are following this person    very influential    and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV. So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together. One last example from this data  Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special. So if we go and look at this piece of content  President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago  and look at what we find in this same data set  at the same scale  the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable. A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on the broadcast. And of course  through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language. We can X ray and get a real time pulse of a nation  real time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content. So  to summarize  the idea is this  As our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they're saying it in  what's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen. It's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication. And I think the implications here are profound  whether it's for science  for commerce  for government  or perhaps most of all  for us as individuals. And so just to return to my son  when I was preparing this talk  he was looking over my shoulder  and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today  and I asked him for permission    granted. And then I went on to reflect   Isn't it amazing  this entire database  all these recordings  I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister     who arrived two years later     and you guys are going to be able to go back and re experience moments that you could never  with your biological memory  possibly remember the way you can now   And he was quiet for a moment. And I thought   What am I thinking  He's five years old. He's not going to understand this.  And just as I was having that thought  he looked up at me and said   So that when I grow up  I can show this to my kids   And I thought   Wow  this is powerful stuff.  So I want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family. This is the first time our son took more than two steps at once    captured on film. And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through. It's a cluttered environment  it's natural life. My mother's in the kitchen  cooking  and  of all places  in the hallway  I realize he's about to do it  about to take more than two steps. And so you hear me encouraging him  realizing what's happening  and then the magic happens. Listen very carefully. About three steps in  he realizes something magic is happening  and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in  and he takes a breath in  and he whispers  wow  and instinctively I echo back the same. And so let's fly back in time to that memorable moment. Come here. Can you do it  Oh  boy. Can you do it  Baby  Yeah. DR  Ma  he's walking. DR  Thank you. This is a river. This is a stream. This is a river. This is happening all over the country. There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States. On this map  the colored areas represent water conflicts. Similar problems are emerging in the east as well. The reasons vary state to state  but mostly in the details. There are       miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone. They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife. They're the veins of the ecosystem  and they're often empty veins. I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story. This is Prickly Pear Creek. It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena. It supports wild fish including cutthroat  brown and rainbow trout. Nearly every year for more than a hundred years  it's looked like this in the summer. How did we get here  Well  it started back in the late     s when people started settling in places like Montana. In short  there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people. But as more people showed up wanting water  the folks who were there first got a little concerned  and in       Montana passed its first water law. It basically said  everybody near the stream can share in the stream. Oddly  a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream  and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers. There were precedent setting suits in      and       both involving Prickly Pear Creek. And in       the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first  or  senior water rights.  These senior water rights are key. The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this. Some of these creeks have claims for    to     times more water than is actually in the stream. And the senior water rights holders  if they don't use their water right  they risk losing their water right  along with the economic value that goes with it. So they have no incentive to conserve. So it's not just about the number of people  the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it. So after decades of lawsuits and     years  now  of experience  we still have this. It's a broken system. There's a disincentive to conserve  because  if you don't use your water right  you can lose your water right. And I'm sure you all know  this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities. Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here. Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free  and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer. There's another thing happening around the country  which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint. They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water  they're trying to be really efficient with their water use  and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand. Well  it's a national problem  but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana  and it involves beer. I bet you didn't know  it takes about   pints of water to make a pint of beer. If you include all the drain  it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer. Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption  but they still use millions of gallons of water. I mean  there's water in beer. So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem  These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers. After all  there's a strong correlation between water and fishing  and for some  there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer. So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned  and they're looking for some way to address the problem. So how can they address this remaining water footprint  Remember Prickly Pear. Up until now  business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing  and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore. Remember Prickly Pear. It's a broken system. You've got a disincentive to conserve  because if you don't use your water right  you risk losing your water right. Well  we decided to connect these two worlds    the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks. In some states  senior water rights holders can leave their water in stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right. After all  it is their water right  and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream  it's their right to do so. But they have no incentive to do so. So  working with local water trusts  we created an incentive to do so. We pay them to leave their water in stream. That's what's happening here. This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion  leaving the water in the stream. He doesn't lose the water right  he just chooses to apply that right  or some portion of it  to the stream  instead of to the land. Because he's the senior water rights holder  he can protect the water from other users in the stream. Okay  He gets paid to leave the water in the stream. This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream. We then take the measured water  we divide it into thousand gallon increments. Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate  and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems. The brewers pay to restore water to the stream. It provides a simple  inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems  while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them. After     years of conflict and     years of dry streams  a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved  we put together a market based  willing buyer  willing seller solution    a solution that does not require litigation. It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed  into these degraded ecosystems  while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used. These transactions create allies  not enemies. They connect people rather than dividing them. And they provide needed economic support for rural communities. And most importantly  it's working. We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems. We've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in Montana  with hotels and tea companies in Oregon and with high tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest. And when we make these connections  we can and we do turn this into this. Thank you very much. When I got my current job  I was given a good piece of advice  which was to interview three politicians every day. And from that much contact with politicians  I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another. They have what I called  logorrhea dementia   which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. But what they do have is incredible social skills. When you meet them  they lock into you  they look you in the eye  they invade your personal space  they massage the back of your head. I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal    squeezing it. I once    this was years ago    I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate. And they were friends  and they hugged each other and they were laughing  and their faces were like this far apart. And they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other. And I was like   Get a room. I don't want to see this.  But they have those social skills. Another case  Last election cycle  I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire  and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons  Bip  Chip  Rip  Zip  Lip and Dip. And he's going into a diner. And he goes into the diner  introduces himself to a family and says   What village are you from in New Hampshire   And then he describes the home he owned in their village. And so he goes around the room  and then as he's leaving the diner  he first names almost everybody he's just met. I was like   Okay  that's social skill.  But the paradox is  when a lot of these people slip into the policy making mode  that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants. So in the course of my career  I have covered a series of failures. We sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up  and what they really lacked was social trust. We invaded Iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities. We had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid. For    years  I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes    charters  private schools  vouchers    but we've had disappointing results year after year. And the fact is  people learn from people they love. And if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student  you're not talking about that reality. But that reality is expunged from our policy making process. And so that's led to a question for me  Why are the most socially attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy  And I came to the conclusion  this is a symptom of a larger problem. That  for centuries  we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that we're divided selves  that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions. And it's led to a view of human nature that we're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives  and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is. And it's produced a great amputation  a shallow view of human nature. We're really good at talking about material things  but we're really bad at talking about emotions. We're really good at talking about skills and safety and health  we're really bad at talking about character. Alasdair MacIntyre  the famous philosopher  said that   We have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue  honor  goodness  but we no longer have a system by which to connect them.  And so this has led to a shallow path in politics  but also in a whole range of human endeavors. You can see it in the way we raise our young kids. You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out  and they're wearing these    pound backpacks. If the wind blows them over  they're like beetles stuck there on the ground. You see these cars that drive up    usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos  because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car  so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy    that's fine. They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber moms  who are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard. And you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children. So at the moment of conception  they're doing little butt exercises. Babies flop out  they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things. Driving them home  and they want them to be enlightened  so they take them to Ben   Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy. In one of my books  I joke that Ben   Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste    doesn't kill germs  just asks them to leave. It would be a big seller. And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula  and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International. They buy these seaweed based snacks there called Veggie Booty with Kale  which is for kids who come home and say   Mom  mom  I want a snack that'll help prevent colon rectal cancer.  And so the kids are raised in a certain way  jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure    SAT prep  oboe  soccer practice. They get into competitive colleges  they get good jobs  and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner  and they make a ton of money. And sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen. And they've become elegant and slender    they don't really have thighs  they just have one elegant calve on top of another. They have kids of their own  and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people  so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein  their daughters looks like Halle Berry    I don't know how they've done that. They get there and they realize it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights. So they've got these furry     pound dogs    all look like velociraptors  all named after Jane Austen characters. And then when they get old  they haven't really developed a philosophy of life  but they've decided   I've been successful at everything  I'm just not going to die.  And so they hire personal trainers  they're popping Cialis like breath mints. You see them on the mountains up there. They're cross country skiing up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis. And as they whiz by you  it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet going up the hill. And so this is part of what life is  but it's not all of what life is. And over the past few years  I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are. And it's not based on theology or philosophy  it's in the study of the mind  across all these spheres of research  from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists  behavioral economists  psychologists  sociology  we're developing a revolution in consciousness. And when you synthesize it all  it's giving us a new view of human nature. And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature  it's a new humanism  it's a new enchantment. And I think when you synthesize this research  you start with three key insights. The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species  the unconscious mind does most of the work. And so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute  of which it can be consciously aware of about   . And this leads to oddities. One of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists  people named Lawrence become lawyers  because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar  which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks. Another finding is that the unconscious  far from being dumb and sexualized  is actually quite smart. So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture. It's really hard to imagine a sofa  how it's going to look in your house. And the way you should do that is study the furniture  let it marinate in your mind  distract yourself  and then a few days later  go with your gut  because unconsciously you've figured it out. The second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking. People with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart  they're actually sometimes quite helpless. And the  giant  in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning    Antonio Damasio. And one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason  but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value. And so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom. Now I'm a middle aged guy. I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions. One of my favorite brain stories described these middle aged guys. They put them into a brain scan machine    this is apocryphal by the way  but I don't care    and they had them watch a horror movie  and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives. And the brain scans were identical in both activities. It was just sheer terror. So me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony  but it is the central organizing process of the way we think. It tells us what to imprint. The brain is the record of the feelings of a life. And the third insight is that we're not primarily self contained individuals. We're social animals  not rational animals. We emerge out of relationships  and we are deeply interpenetrated  one with another. And so when we see another person  we reenact in our own minds what we see in their minds. When we watch a car chase in a movie  it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase. When we watch pornography  it's a little like having sex  though probably not as good. And we see this when lovers walk down the street  when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion  the deep interpenetration. And this revolution in who we are gives us a different way of seeing  I think  politics  a different way  most importantly  of seeing human capital. We are now children of the French Enlightenment. We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties. But I think this research shows that the British Enlightenment  or the Scottish Enlightenment  with David Hume  Adam Smith  actually had a better handle on who we are    that reason is often weak  our sentiments are strong  and our sentiments are often trustworthy. And this work corrects that bias in our culture  that dehumanizing bias. It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life. When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily    things like grades  SAT's  degrees  the number of years in schooling. What it really takes to do well  to lead a meaningful life  are things that are deeper  things we don't really even have words for. And so let me list just a couple of the things I think this research points us toward trying to understand. The first gift  or talent  is mindsight    the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer. Babies come with this ability. Meltzoff  who's at the University of Washington  leaned over a baby who was    minutes old. He wagged his tongue at the baby. The baby wagged her tongue back. Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind and to download what they find    their models of how to understand reality. In the United States     percent of babies have a deep two way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people. And those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life. Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict with    percent accuracy  at age    months  who was going to graduate from high school  based on who had good attachment with mom. Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships. They are what we call avoidantly attached. They have trouble relating to other people. They go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind    wanting to get close to people  but not really having the models of how to do that. And so this is one skill of how to hoover up knowledge  one from another. A second skill is equipoise  the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind. So for example  we are overconfidence machines. Ninety five percent of our professors report that they are above average teachers. Ninety six percent of college students say they have above average social skills. Time magazine asked Americans   Are you in the top one percent of earners   Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners. This is a gender linked trait  by the way. Men drown at twice the rate of women  because men think they can swim across that lake. But some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases  their own overconfidence. They have epistemological modesty. They are open minded in the face of ambiguity. They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence. They are curious. And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ. The third trait is metis  what we might call street smarts    it's a Greek word. It's a sensitivity to the physical environment  the ability to pick out patterns in an environment    derive a gist. One of my colleagues at the Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an IED  a landmine  in the street. They couldn't tell you how they did it  but they could feel cold  they felt a coldness  and they were more often right than wrong. The third is what you might call sympathy  the ability to work within groups. And that comes in tremendously handy  because groups are smarter than individuals. And face to face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically  because    percent of our communication is non verbal. And the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group  it's determined by how well they communicate  how often they take turns in conversation. Then you could talk about a trait like blending. Any child can say   I'm a tiger   pretend to be a tiger. It seems so elementary. But in fact  it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept  I  and a concept  tiger  and blend them together. But this is the source of innovation. What Picasso did  for example  was take the concept  Western art  and the concept  African masks  and blend them together    not only the geometry  but the moral systems entailed in them. And these are skills  again  we can't count and measure. And then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence. And this is not an ability  it's a drive and a motivation. The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige. The unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence  when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task    when a craftsman feels lost in his craft  when a naturalist feels at one with nature  when a believer feels at one with God's love. That is what the unconscious mind hungers for. And many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused. And one of the most beautiful descriptions I've come across in this research of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana. He was married to a woman named Carol  and they had a wonderful relationship. When their kids were five and two  Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly. And Hofstadter wrote a book called  I Am a Strange Loop.  In the course of that book  he describes a moment    just months after Carol has died    he comes across her picture on the mantel  or on a bureau in his bedroom. And here's what he wrote   I looked at her face  and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes. And all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed  'That's me. That's me.' And those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before  about the fusion of our souls into one higher level entity  about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children  about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes  but were just one hope  one clear thing that defined us both  that welded us into a unit    the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children. I realized that  though Carol had died  that core piece of her had not died at all  but had lived on very determinedly in my brain.  The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom. Through his suffering  Hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are. Through the policy failures of the last    years  we have come to acknowledge  I think  how shallow our view of human nature has been. And now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are  comes this revolution in consciousness    these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted  this new humanism. And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious  it had a vast effect on the climate of the times. Now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious  of who we are deep inside  and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture. Thank you. I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that  by far  most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light. We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes. The Sun burns our peripheral vision. We see light reflected off the Moon. And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies  the known universe has come to us through light  across vast eras in cosmic history. And with all of our modern telescopes  we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe    these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang. And yet  the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent. I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself  because space can wobble like a drum. It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold. Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe    a sonic composition. And while we've never heard the sounds from space  we really should  in the next few years  start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there. So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe  we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have  because black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song  which I'd like to play for you    some of our predictions for what that song will be like. Now black holes are dark against a dark sky. We can't see them directly. They're not brought to us with light  at least not directly. We can see them indirectly  because black holes wreak havoc on their environment. They destroy stars around them. They churn up debris in their surroundings. But they won't come to us directly through light. We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background  but we haven't yet. And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen  and that's because they bang on space time like a drum. Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein    to whom we owe so much. Einstein realized that if space were empty  if the universe were empty  it would be like this picture  except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it. But if we were freely falling through the space  even without this helpful grid  we might be able to paint it ourselves  because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines  undeflected straight paths through the universe. Einstein also realized    and this is the real meat of the matter    that if you put energy or mass in the universe  it would curve space  and a freely falling object would pass by  let's say  the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space. It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity. Now even light will be bent by those paths. And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun  as the Earth is  or the Moon around the Earth. These are the natural curves in space. What Einstein did not realize was that  if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers    so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across  you would make a black hole  an object so dense that if light veered too close  it would never escape    a dark shadow against the universe. It wasn't Einstein who realized this  it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I    joined the German army already an accomplished scientist  working on the Russian front. I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire  and then  in between  calculating Einstein's equations    as you do in the trenches. And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity  and he was thrilled by this theory. And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary  curves so strong that space would rain down into them  space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole. And even light could not escape this current. Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be  and all that would be left would be a shadow. Now he wrote to Einstein  and he said   As you will see  the war has been kind to me enough. Despite the heavy gunfire  I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas.  And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution  and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist. This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions. And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week. But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity. He did not believe they existed in nature. He thought nature would protect us from their formation. It was decades before the term  black hole  was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects    in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime. Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole. It's actually not massive enough. But if we did a little thought experiment    as Einstein was very fond of doing    we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers  and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit  maybe    kilometers outside of the black hole sun. And it would be self illuminated  because now the Sun's gone  we have no other source of light    so let's make our little Earth self illuminated. And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even    km outside of this crushed black hole. This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan  more or less. It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth. But basically that's what we're talking about. We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan. So we move this Earth very close       kilometers outside    and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole. There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe  but you actually have to get very close to fall in. But what's very impressive is that  from our vantage point  we can always see the Earth. It cannot hide behind the black hole. The light from the Earth  some of it falls in  but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us. So you can't hide anything behind a black hole. If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons  don't hide behind the black hole. They can see you. Now  our Sun will not collapse to a black hole    it's not massive enough    but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy. And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way  this is what it would look like. We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes. And if we were to fall towards this black hole  we would see all of that light lensed around it  and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened. It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't  anymore than light can escape. But even though the black hole is dark from the outside  it's not dark on the inside  because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us. And even though  due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation  our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time  it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us  right before we were crushed to death by the black hole. It would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel  but it's a total death experience. And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel. Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole  but black holes can be heard  even if they're not seen. Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation    imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together. Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes    each one    times the mass of the Sun. So now we're going to crush them down to    kilometers across. They can be spinning hundreds of times a second. At the end of their lives  they're going around each other very near the speed of light. So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second  and as they do so  they not only curve space  but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space  an actual wave on space time. Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe. And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light. This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard. It took almost    years for anyone in the world to crack this problem. This was one of the groups. It shows two black holes in orbit around each other  again  with these helpfully painted curves. And if you can see    it's kind of faint    but if you can see the red waves emanating out  those are the gravitational waves. They're literally the sounds of space ringing  and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning  quiet black hole at the end of the day. If you were standing near enough  your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space. You would literally hear the sound. Now of course  your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully  so you might have trouble understanding what's going on. But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict. This is from my group    a slightly less glamorous computer modeling. Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close. If it gets far away  it's a little too quiet. But it comes in like a mallet  and it literally cracks space  wobbling it like a drum. And we can predict what the sound will be. We know that  as it falls in  it gets faster and it gets louder. And eventually  we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. Then it's gone. Now I've never heard it that loud    it's actually more dramatic. At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic. It's sort of like ding  ding  ding. This is another sound from my group. No  I'm not showing you any images  because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink  and space is not painted  showing you the curves. But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this  you want to get moving. Want to get away from the sound. Both black holes are moving. Both black holes are getting closer together. In this case  they're both wobbling quite a lot. And then they're going to merge. Now it's gone. Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging    that it chirps up at the end. Now that's our prediction for what we'll see. Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach  California. And surely  somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged. And surely  the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years  or a million years  at the speed of light to get to us. But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear. There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth    one called LIGO    which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers. It's a remarkably ambitious experiment  and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years    to pick this up. There's also a mission proposed for space  which hopefully will launch in the next ten years  called LISA. And LISA will be able to see super massive black holes    black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun. In this Hubble image  we see two galaxies. They look like they're frozen in some embrace. And each one probably harbors a super massive black hole at its core. But they're not frozen  they're actually merging. These two black holes are colliding  and they will merge over a billion year time scale. It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration. But LISA could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history  the last    minutes before they fall together. And it's not just black holes  but it's also any big disturbance in the universe    and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang. When that expression was coined  it was derisive    like   Oh  who would believe in a Big Bang   But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang. It might make a sound. This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside. We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe. So imagine you're inside the Big Bang. It's everywhere  it's all around you  and the space is wobbling chaotically. Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us. Galaxies form  and generations of stars form in those galaxies  and around one star  at least one star  is a habitable planet. And here we are frantically building these experiments  doing these calculations  writing these computer codes. Imagine a billion years ago  two black holes collided. That song has been ringing through space for all that time. We weren't even here. It gets closer and closer           years ago  we're still doing cave paintings. It's like hurry  build your instruments. It's getting closer and closer  and in    ... whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity    we'll build them  we'll turn on the machines and  bang  we'll catch it    the first song from space. If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up  it would sound like this. It's literally the definition of noise. It's white noise  it's such a chaotic ringing. But it's around us everywhere  presumably  if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe. And if we pick it up  it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation  of our observable universe. So within the next few years  we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit  render the universe in audio. But if we detect those earliest moments  it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang  which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest  most elusive  questions. If we run the movie of our universe backwards  we know that there was a Big Bang in our past  and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it  but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang  I mean we have to ask  has it happened before  Will it happen again  I mean  in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder  we can ask questions  at least for this last minute  that honestly might evade us forever. But we have to ask  Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history  Or  is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse    each branch with its own Big Bang in its past    maybe some of them with black holes playing drums  maybe some without    maybe some with sentient life  and maybe some without    not in our past  not in our future  but somehow fundamentally connected to us  So we have to wonder  if there is a multiverse  in some other patch of that multiverse  are there creatures  Here's my multiverse creatures. Are there other creatures in the multiverse  wondering about us and wondering about their own origins  And if they are  I can imagine them as we are  calculating  writing computer code  building instruments  trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there. Thank you. Thank you. Back in New York  I am the head of development for a non profit called Robin Hood. When I'm not fighting poverty  I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. Now in our town  where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff  you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. I remember my first fire. I was the second volunteer on the scene  so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in. But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be. When I found the captain  he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner  who was surely having one of the worst days of her life. Here it was  the middle of the night  she was standing outside in the pouring rain  under an umbrella  in her pajamas  barefoot  while her house was in flames. The other volunteer who had arrived just before me    let's call him Lex Luther    got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog  I was stunned with jealousy. Here was some lawyer or money manager who  for the rest of his life  gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature  just because he beat me by five seconds. Well  I was next. The captain waved me over. He said   Bezos  I need you to go into the house. I need you to go upstairs  past the fire  and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes.  I swear. So  not exactly what I was hoping for  but off I went    up the stairs  down the hall  past the 'real' firefighters  who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point  into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. Now I know what you're thinking  but I'm no hero. I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door. We took our treasures outside to the homeowner  where  not surprisingly  his received much more attention than did mine. A few weeks later  the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home. The act of kindness she noted above all others  someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter  I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale  but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis. And you know what I've learned  They all matter. So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved  or are on their way to achieving  remarkable levels of success  I would offer this reminder  don't wait. Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life. If you have something to give  give it now. Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. Be a mentor. Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life  but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. So get in the game. Save the shoes. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Mark  Mark  come back. Mark Bezos  Thank you. There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says   Light creates ambiance  light makes the feel of a space  and light is also the expression of structure.  Well  that was not by me. That was  of course  by Le Corbusier  the famous architect. And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings    the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut De Ronchamp    where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark. And I think that is the quintessence of this    minute talk    that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well being without proper darkness. So this is how we normally would light our offices. We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much Lux and of great uniformity. This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps. And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier. If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome  it would never have looked like this  because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building. And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said   Light  I make it in my buildings for comfort.  And he didn't mean the comfort of a five course dinner as opposed to a one course meal  but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people. He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun. And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky  and where you can experience the sun  that give us a better life in the built environment  just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows. And what it all boils down to is  of course  the sun. And this image of the Sun may suggest that the Sun is something evil and aggressive  but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the Sun  and light is only a manifestation of that energy. The sun is for dynamics  for color changes. The sun is for beauty in our environment  like in this building    the High Museum in Atlanta  which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy  together with Arup Lighting  a brilliant team of lighting designers  who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space  responding to what the sun does outside  just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof. So in an indirect way  you can see the sun. And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum. They created this shade that you can see here  which actually covers the sun  but opens up to the good light from the sky. And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models  with quantitative as well as qualitative methods  to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture. They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way. As you can see here  there's some direct light on the floor  but they could easily figure out where that comes from. And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun  the good part of the sun. And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways  of course. It can be just like this  or maybe like this  which is rather peculiar  but this is in         the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States. And it's just a bit bright up there  so these people have found a very intriguing solution. This is  I think  a very illustrative image of what I try to say    that the beautiful dynamics of sun  bringing these into the building  creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives. And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness  of course  because otherwise you don't see these dynamics. As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk  this is a well known office  which is the Weidt Group. They are in green energy consulting  or something like that. And they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all. It has only  on one side  this big  big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range. So it can be very dim over there  and you do your work  and it can be very bright over there  and you do your work. But actually  the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull  and therefore helps us to enhance our lives. I really owe a short introduction of this man to you. This is Richard Kelly who was born     years ago  which is the reason I bring him up now  because it's kind of an anniversary year. In the     s  Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design. And he coined three terms  which are  focal glow    ambient luminescence  and  play of the brilliants     three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience. So to begin with  focal glow. He meant something like this    where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around. Or something like this  which is the lighting design he did for General Motors  for the car showroom. And you enter that space  and you feel like   Wow  This is so impressive   just because of this focal point  this huge light source in the middle. To me  it is something from theater  and I will get back to that a little bit later. It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus. It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land  highlighting it compared to the dim environment. Or it can be in today's retail  in the shopping environment    lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around. Ambient luminescence is something very different. Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite  something without any focus  something where all details actually dissolve in infinity. And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate. It could also be something like this  the National Museum of Science in London  where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture. And then finally  Kelly's play of brilliants added to that really some play  I think  of the skyline of Hong Kong  or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house  or in the theater here  which is the decoration  the icing on the cake  something playful  something that is just an addition to the architectural environment  I would say. These three distinct elements  together  make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better. And we can only create these out of darkness. And I will explain that further. And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly  here on the left  was explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe. And behind them  you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design. Those times  there were some early attempts also for light therapy already. You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine  where people are put in the sun to get better. It's a little bit of a different story  this health aspect of light  than what I'm telling you today. In today's modern medicine  there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way. And there is the idea that  when we look at things  it is the yellow light that helps us the most  that we are the most sensitive for. But our circadian rhythms  which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on  they are much more triggered by blue light. And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment  we can help people to relax  or to be alert  to fall asleep  or to stay awake. And that is how  maybe in the near future  light can help hospitals to make people better sooner  recover them quicker. Maybe in the airplane  we can overcome jet lag like that. Perhaps in school  we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work. And you can imagine a lot more applications. But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life. So light is  of course  for social interaction also    to create relationships with all the features around us. It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other. And it is all about this planet. But when you look at this planet at night  it looks like this. And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today. Because all this light here goes up to the sky. It never reaches the ground where it was meant for. It never is to the benefit of people. It only spoils the darkness. So at a global scale  it looks like this. And  I mean  that is quite amazing  what you see here    how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground. Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be  it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything. The world is changing though  and urbanization is a big driver of everything. I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou  and I realized that    years ago  there was nothing like this  of these buildings. It was just a much smaller city  and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous. And we have to understand these main questions  How do people move through these new urban spaces  How do they share their culture  How do we tackle things like mobility  And how can light help there  Because the new technologies  they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments. It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps. And of course  we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that. Now we have LED  but here you see the latest one  and you see how incredibly small it is. And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity  because this tiny  tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it. And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness. So that is a really interesting proposition  I think  and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well being in mind. The problem is  though  that I wanted to explain to you how this really works    but I can have four of these on my finger  so you would not be able to really see them. So I asked our laboratory to do something about it  and they said   Well  we can do something.  They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam. So here it is. It's the same thing as you can see over there    just     times bigger. And I will very quickly show you how it works. So just to explain. Now  every LED that is made these days gives blue light. Now  this is not very pleasant and comfortable. And for that reason  we cover the LED with a phosphor cap. And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant. And then when you add the lens to that  you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else. So you can preserve the darkness and make the light. I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works. Thank you. We can go further. So we have to rethink the way we light our cities. We have to think again about light as a default solution. Why are all these motorways permanently lit  Is it really needed  Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness  Can we be much more gentle with light  Like here    this is a very low light level actually. Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create  so they really want to connect with it  like here  Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around  And can we preserve the darkness  Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very  very challenging. And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult. Even in the oceans  we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well being. And it's known that migrating birds  for example  get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms. And we discovered that when we make those lights green  the birds  they actually go the right way. They are not disturbed anymore. And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here. In all of these examples  I think  we should start making the light out of darkness  and use the darkness as a canvas    like the visual artists do  like Edward Hopper in this painting. I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting. I think  when I see it  I start to think  who are those people  Where have they come from  Where are they going  What just happened  What will be happening in the next five minutes  And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light. Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark. And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments. We can do that in commercial spaces like this. And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe  which is  of course  the universe itself. So I give you this wonderful  informative image of the sky  ranging from the inner city  where you may see one or two stars and nothing else  all the way to the rural environments  where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars. In architecture  it works just the same. By appreciating the darkness when you design the light  you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives. This is the most well known example  Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals  where light and dark  in very gentle combinations  alter each other to define the space. Or Richard MacCormac's Southwark tube station in London  where you can really see the sky  even though you are under the ground. And finally  I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater. And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks. It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater. And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light. Thank you very much. If I should have a daughter  instead of  Mom   she's going to call me  Point B   because that way she knows that no matter what happens  at least she can always find her way to me. And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say   Oh  I know that like the back of my hand.  And she's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face  wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt  here  that cannot be fixed by Band Aids or poetry. So the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming  I'll make sure she knows she doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself  because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers  your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. Believe me  I've tried.  And  baby   I'll tell her  don't keep your nose up in the air like that. I know that trick  I've done it a million times. You're just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house  so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place  to see if you can change him. But I know she will anyway  so instead I'll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby  because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix. Okay  there's a few that chocolate can't fix. But that's what the rain boots are for  because rain will wash away everything  if you let it. I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat  to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind  because that's the way my mom taught me. That there'll be days like this. When you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises  when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape  when your boots will fill with rain  and you'll be up to your knees in disappointment. And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you. Because there's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline  no matter how many times it's sent away. You will put the wind in win some  lose some. You will put the star in starting over  and over. And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute  be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life. And yes  on a scale from one to over trusting  I am pretty damn naive. But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. It can crumble so easily  but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.  Baby   I'll tell her   remember  your momma is a worrier  and your poppa is a warrior  and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.  Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things. Always apologize when you've done something wrong  but don't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining. Your voice is small  but don't ever stop singing. And when they finally hand you heartache  when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street corners of cynicism and defeat  you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. All right  so I want you to take a moment  and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true. They can be about whatever you want    technology  entertainment  design  your family  what you had for breakfast. The only rule is don't think too hard. Okay  ready  Go. Okay. So here are three things I know to be true. I know that Jean Luc Godard was right when he said that   A good story has a beginning  a middle and an end  although not necessarily in that order.  I know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here  which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool. And I know that I have been waiting all week to tell this joke. Why was the scarecrow invited to TED  Because he was out standing in his field. I'm sorry. Okay  so these are three things I know to be true. But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding. So I write poems to figure things out. Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem. Sometimes I get to the end of the poem  look back and go   Oh  that's what this is all about   and sometimes I get to the end of the poem and haven't solved anything  but at least I have a new poem out of it. Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry. I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper  that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person. When I was a freshman in high school  I was a live wire of nervous hormones. And I was underdeveloped and over excitable. And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long  I was fascinated by the idea of spoken word poetry. I felt that my two secret loves  poetry and theater  had come together  had a baby  a baby I needed to get to know. So I decided to give it a try. My first spoken word poem  packed with all the wisdom of a    year old  was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine. The poem was very indignant  and mainly exaggerated  but the only spoken word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant  so I thought that's what was expected of me. The first time that I performed  the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy  and when I came off the stage  I was shaking. I felt this tap on my shoulder  and I turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd. She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand  but instead she just nodded at me and said   Hey  I really felt that. Thanks.  And lightning struck. I was hooked. I discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic  and my bewildered  but supportive  parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could. I was the youngest by at least a decade  but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem bothered by the    year old wandering about. In fact  they welcomed me. And it was here  listening to these poets share their stories  that I learned that spoken word poetry didn't have to be indignant  it could be fun or painful or serious or silly. The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home  and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well. Never mind the fact that I was   . They told me   Write about being   .  So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant  grown up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me   Hey  I really felt that too.  Now I can divide my spoken word journey into three steps. Step one was the moment I said   I can. I can do this.  And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie. Step two was the moment I said   I will. I will continue. I love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week.  And step three began when I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems  if that's not what I was. There were things that were specific to me  and the more that I focused on those things  the weirder my poetry got  but the more that it felt like mine. It's not just the adage  Write what you know.  It's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience you've collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don't know. I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand  but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been. When I got to university  I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken word poetry. And actually  Phil Kaye and I coincidentally also share the same last name. When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E. as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me. But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E.  this time changing the mission to using spoken word poetry as a way to entertain  educate and inspire. We stayed full time students  but in between we traveled  performing and teaching nine year olds to MFA candidates  from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus. And we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks. But it turns out sometimes  poetry can be really scary. Turns out sometimes  you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry. So I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists. And the first list that I assign is     Things I Know to be True.  And here's what happens  you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud. At a certain point  you would realize that someone has the exact same thing  or one thing very similar  to something on your list. And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours. Third  someone has something you've never even heard of before. Fourth  someone has something you thought you knew everything about  but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it. And I tell people that this is where great stories start from    these four intersections of what you're passionate about and what others might be invested in. And most people respond really well to this exercise. But one of my students  a freshman named Charlotte  was not convinced. Charlotte was very good at writing lists  but she refused to write any poems.  Miss   she'd say   I'm just not interesting. I don't have anything interesting to say.  So I assigned her list after list  and one day I assigned the list     Things I Should Have Learned by Now.  Number three on Charlotte's list was   I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age.  I asked her what that meant  and she said   Miss  it's kind of a long story.  And I said   Charlotte  it sounds pretty interesting to me.  And so she wrote her first poem  a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before. And the poem began   Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man.   Did you see him on    Minutes  racing Michael Phelps in a pool    nothing but swim trunks on    diving in the water  determined to beat this swimming champion  After the race  he tossed his wet  cloud white hair and said  'You're a god.' No  Anderson  you're the god.  Now  I know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed  to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you. Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this. You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up. But I try to walk through life like this. And yes  that means catching all of those miseries and hurt  but it also means that when beautiful  amazing things just fall out of the sky  I'm ready to catch them. I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder  to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and  instead  actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them  so that they can reinterpret and create something from it. It's not that I think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form. I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story. I write musicals  I make short films alongside my poems. But I teach spoken word poetry because it's accessible. Not everyone can read music or owns a camera  but everyone can communicate in some way  and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from. Plus  spoken word poetry allows for immediate connection. It's not uncommon to feel like you're alone or that nobody understands you  but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions  you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers  or your community  who will listen. And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what you've shared. And that is an amazing realization to have  especially when you're   . Plus  now with YouTube  that connection's not even limited to the room we're in. I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students. It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to. Once you've figured this out  it is tempting to keep writing the same poem  or keep telling the same story  over and over  once you've figured out that it will gain you applause. It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself. You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself. And that is step three  infusing the work you're doing with the specific things that make you you  even while those things are always changing. Because step three never ends. But you don't get to start on step three  until you take step one first   I can.  I travel a lot while I'm teaching  and I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three  but I was very lucky with Charlotte  that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did. I watched her realize that  by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing  she can create poems that only Charlotte can write  about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer. And I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell    like this story. I spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story  and I wondered if the best way was going to be a PowerPoint  a short film    And where exactly was the beginning  the middle or the end  I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out  or not. And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club  but it's possible that it was much earlier. In preparing for TED  I discovered this diary page in an old journal. I think December   th was probably supposed to be   th. It's clear that when I was a child  I definitely walked through life like this. I think that we all did. I would like to help others rediscover that wonder    to want to engage with it  to want to learn  to want to share what they've learned  what they've figured out to be true and what they're still figuring out. So I'd like to close with this poem. When they bombed Hiroshima  the explosion formed a mini supernova  so every living animal  human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash. And what was left of the city soon followed. The long lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder. When I was born  my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said   This  I've done this before.  She says I have old eyes. When my Grandpa Genji died  I was only five years old  but I took my mom by the hand and told her   Don't worry  he'll come back as a baby.  And yet  for someone who's apparently done this already  I still haven't figured anything out yet. My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage. My self confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry  and it still always tastes funny in my mouth. But in Hiroshima  some people were wiped clean away  leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page. So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets  I keep trying  hoping that one day I'll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed. My parents named me Sarah  which is a biblical name. In the original story  God told Sarah she could do something impossible  and    she laughed  because the first Sarah  she didn't know what to do with impossible. And me  Well  neither do I  but I see the impossible every day. Impossible is trying to connect in this world  trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you  knowing that while you're speaking  they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk    they hear you. They feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it. It's what I strive for every time I open my mouth    that impossible connection. There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation. But on the front step  a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone. The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light. After the A bomb  specialists said it would take    years for the radiation damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again. But that spring  there were new buds popping up from the earth. When I meet you  in that moment  I'm no longer a part of your future. I start quickly becoming part of your past. But in that instant  I get to share your present. And you  you get to share mine. And that is the greatest present of all. So if you tell me I can do the impossible    I'll probably laugh at you. I don't know if I can change the world yet  because I don't know that much about it    and I don't know that much about reincarnation either  but if you make me laugh hard enough  sometimes I forget what century I'm in. This isn't my first time here. This isn't my last time here. These aren't the last words I'll share. But just in case  I'm trying my hardest to get it right this time around. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life. That was a great day for my mother. My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine  and the first day it was going to be used  even Grandma was invited to see the machine. And Grandma was even more excited. Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood  and she had hand washed laundry for seven children. And now she was going to watch electricity do that work. My mother carefully opened the door  and she loaded the laundry into the machine  like this. And then  when she closed the door  Grandma said   No  no  no  no. Let me  let me push the button.  And Grandma pushed the button  and she said   Oh  fantastic  I want to see this  Give me a chair  Give me a chair  I want to see it   and she sat down in front of the machine  and she watched the entire washing program. She was mesmerized. To my grandmother  the washing machine was a miracle. Today  in Sweden and other rich countries  people are using so many different machines. Look  the homes are full of machines. I can't even name them all. And they also  when they want to travel  they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations. And yet  in the world  there are so many people who still heat the water on fire  and they cook their food on fire. Sometimes they don't even have enough food  and they live below the poverty line. There are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day. And the richest people over there    there's one billion people    and they live above what I call the  air line   because they spend more than     a day on their consumption. But this is just one  two  three billion people  and obviously there are seven billion people in the world  so there must be one  two  three  four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line. They have electricity  but the question is  how many have washing machines  I've done the scrutiny of market data  and I've found that  indeed  the washing machine has penetrated below the air line  and today there's an additional one billion people out there who live above the  wash line.  And they consume more than     per day. So two billion have access to washing machines. And the remaining five billion  how do they wash  Or  to be more precise  how do most of the women in the world wash  Because it remains hard work for women to wash. They wash like this  by hand. It's a hard  time consuming labor  which they have to do for hours every week. And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home  or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off. And they want the washing machine. They don't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity. And there's nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma. Look here  two generations ago in Sweden    picking water from the stream  heating with firewood and washing like that. They want the washing machine in exactly the same way. But when I lecture to environmentally concerned students  they tell me   No  everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines.  How can we tell this woman that she ain't going to have a washing machine  And then I ask my students  I've asked them    over the last two years I've asked   How many of you doesn't use a car   And some of them proudly raise their hand and say   I don't use a car.  And then I put the really tough question   How many of you hand wash your jeans and your bed sheets   And no one raised their hand. Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines. So how come  this is  something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it  What is special with this  I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world. Here we are. Look here  you see the seven billion people up there  the air people  the wash people  the bulb people and the fire people. One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel    oil  coal or gas. That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is. And it's    units used in the entire world  and the richest one billion  they use six of them. Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population. And these ones who have washing machines  but not a house full of other machines  they use two. This group uses three  one each. And they also have electricity. And over there they don't even use one each. That makes    of them. But the main concern for the environmentally interested students    and they are right    is about the future. What are the trends  If we just prolong the trends  without any real advanced analysis  to       there are two things that can increase the energy use. First  population growth. Second  economic growth. Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman. And  with  that you will get two extra  but that won't change the energy use very much. What will happen is economic growth. The best of here in the emerging economies    I call them the New East    they will jump the air line.  Wopp   they will say. And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already. And these people  they want the washing machine. I told you. They'll go there. And they will double their energy use. And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light. And they'll get a two child family without a stop in population growth. But the total energy consumption will increase to    units. And these    units    still the richest people use most of it. So what needs to be done  Because the risk  the high probability of climate change is real. It's real. Of course they must be more energy efficient. They must change behavior in some way. They must also start to produce green energy  much more green energy. But until they have the same energy consumption per person  they shouldn't give advice to others    what to do and what not to do. Here we can get more green energy all over. This is what we hope may happen. It's a real challenge in the future. But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio  she wants a washing machine. She's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone    so happy that she even voted for her. And she became Dilma Rousseff  the president elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world    moving from minister of energy to president. If you have democracy  people will vote for washing machines. They love them. And what's the magic with them  My mother explained the magic with this machine the very  very first day. She said   Now Hans  we have loaded the laundry. The machine will make the work. And now we can go to the library.  Because this is the magic  you load the laundry  and what do you get out of the machine  You get books out of the machines  children's books. And mother got time to read for me. She loved this. I got the  ABC's     this is where I started my career as a professor  when my mother had time to read for me. And she also got books for herself. She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language. And she read so many novels  so many different novels here. And we really  we really loved this machine. And what we said  my mother and me   Thank you industrialization. Thank you steel mill. Thank you power station. And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books.  Thank you very much. I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival. It's a place where women run the show  have sex to say hello  and play rules the day    where fun is serious business. And no  this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco. Ladies and gentlemen  meet your cousins. This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo. Bonobos are  together with chimpanzees  your living closest relative. That means we all share a common ancestor  an evolutionary grandmother  who lived around six million years ago. Now  chimpanzees are well known for their aggression. But unfortunately  we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution. But bonobos show us the other side of the coin. While chimpanzees are dominated by big  scary guys  bonobo society is run by empowered females. These guys have really worked something out  since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet. But unfortunately  bonobos are the least understood of the great apes. They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle  and it has been very difficult to study them. The Congo is a paradox    a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty  but also the heart of darkness itself    the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War. Not surprisingly  this destruction also endangers bonobo survival. Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world    and we're not even sure of that to be honest. Yet  in this land of violence and chaos  you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees. Who are these cousins  We know them as the  make love  not war  apes since they have frequent  promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. Now  I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems    since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra. Bonobos  like humans  love to play throughout their entire lives. Play is not just child's games. For us and them  play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance. It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game. Play increases creativity and resilience  and it's all about the generation of diversity    diversity of interactions  diversity of behaviors  diversity of connections. And when you watch bonobo play  you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter  dance and ritual. Play is the glue that binds us together. Now  I don't know how you play  but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild. First  it's a ball game bonobo style    and I do not mean football. So here  we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game. Have a look what she's doing. It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase   she's got him by the balls.  Only I think that he's rather loving it here  right  Yeah. So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans. And this video is really interesting because it shows    this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play    such as testicles    and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust    while at the same time being tremendous fun. But play's a shapeshifter. Play's a shapeshifter  and it can take many forms  some of which are more quiet  imaginative  curious    maybe where wonder is discovered anew. And I want you to see  this is Fuku  a young female  and she is quietly playing with water. I think  like her  we sometimes play alone  and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds. And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore  drives us to interact  and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity. So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present. But they also hold a secret for our future  a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation. The secret is that play is the key to these capacities. In other words  play is our adaptive wildcard. In order to adapt successfully to a changing world  we need to play. But will we make the most of our playfulness  Play is not frivolous. Play's essential. For bonobos and humans alike  life is not just red in tooth and claw. In times when it seems least appropriate to play  it might be the times when it is most urgent. And so  my fellow primates  let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together  as we rediscover creativity  fellowship and wonder. Thank you. Today I want to talk about design  but not design as we usually think about it. I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific  biotechnological culture  where  for really the first time in history  we have the power to design bodies  to design animal bodies  to design human bodies. In the history of our planet  there have been three great waves of evolution. The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution. So  as you all know  species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments  and the pressures of those environments selected which changes  through random mutation in species  were going to be preserved. Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution  which was we changed the environment in which we evolved. We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization. And that has been the second great    couple         years          years    flow of our evolution. By changing our environment  we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve. Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities  all the way through modern medicine  we have changed our own evolution. Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history  which has been called many things   intentional evolution    evolution by design     very different than intelligent design    whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet. So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species  as well as our cultures  because of this change. Now we actually have been doing it for a long time. We started selectively breeding animals many  many thousands of years ago. And if you think of dogs for example  dogs are now intentionally designed creatures. There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature. Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like. But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them. We don't have to do it that way anymore. This is a beefalo. A beefalo is a buffalo cattle hybrid. And they are now making them  and someday  perhaps pretty soon  you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket. This is a geep  a goat sheep hybrid. The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards. I think they said it tasted like chicken. This is a cama. A cama is a camel llama hybrid  created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama. And they are now using these in certain cultures. Then there's the liger. This is the largest cat in the world    the lion tiger hybrid. It's bigger than a tiger. And in the case of the liger  there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild. But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology. And then finally  everybody's favorite  the zorse. None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures. And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement  or genetic manipulation  of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics. And if that were all this was about  then it would be an interesting thing. But something much  much more powerful is happening now. These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep sea jellyfish. We all know that some deep sea creatures glow. Well  they've now taken that gene  that bioluminescent gene  and put it into mammal cells. These are normal cells. And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light. Once they could do that with cells  they could do it with organisms. So they did it with mouse pups  kittens. And by the way  the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral  while this is from jellyfish. They did it with pigs. They did it with puppies. And  in fact  they did it with monkeys. And if you can do it with monkeys    though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes    if they can do it in monkeys  they can probably figure out how to do it in apes  which means they can do it in human beings. In other words  it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. Be easier to find us at night. And in fact  right now in many states  you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets. These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver. These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow  green  red  and they are actually available now in certain states. Other states have banned them. Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures. There is no area of the government    not the EPA or the FDA    that controls genetically engineered pets. And so some states have decided to allow them  some states have decided to ban them. Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically engineered salmon. The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon  using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat  to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed. And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether  pretty soon  you could be eating this fish    it'll be sold in the stores. And before you get too worried about it  here in the United States  the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically modified components to it. So even as we worry about it  we have allowed it to go on in this country    much different in Europe    without any regulation  and even without any identification on the package. These are all the first cloned animals of their type. So in the lower right here  you have Dolly  the first cloned sheep    now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh  Ralph the rat  the first cloned rat  CC the cat  for cloned cat  Snuppy  the first cloned dog    Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy    created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo  which he had not. He actually was the first person to clone a dog  which is a very difficult thing to do  because dog genomes are very plastic. This is Prometea  the first cloned horse. It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy  a real  gold ring  of cloning  because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings. In other words  the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed. But if you can clone that horse  you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud. These were the first cloned calves  the first cloned grey wolves  and then  finally  the first cloned piglets  Alexis  Chista  Carrel  Janie and Dotcom. In addition  we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species. This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create. So with antithrombin in that goat    that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create. And then in addition  transgenic pigs  knockout pigs  from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea  are pigs that they are going to use  in fact  to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them  instead of producing them in an industrial way. These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species. The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate. A somatic cell  a body cell  was taken from its body  gestated in the ovum of a cow  and then that cow gave birth to a guar. Same thing happened with the mouflon  where it's an endangered species of sheep. It was gestated in a regular sheep body  which actually raises an interesting biological problem. We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies. We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA  but we also have DNA in our mitochondria  which are the energy packets of the cell. That DNA is passed down through our mothers. So really  what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon  but a guar with cow mitochondria  and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA  and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA. These are really hybrids  not pure animals. And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology    a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve. This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach. And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top  and it's on a big computer tracking ball. And now  using a joystick  they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right  forwards or backwards. They've created a kind of insect bot  or bugbot. It gets worse than that    or perhaps better than that. This actually is one of DARPA's very important    DARPA is the Defense Research Agency    one of their projects. These goliath beetles are wired in their wings. They have a computer chip strapped to their backs  and they can fly these creatures around the lab. They can make them go left  right. They can make them take off. They can't actually make them land. They put them about one inch above the ground  and then they shut everything off and they go pfft. But it's the closest they can get to a landing. And in fact  this technology has gotten so developed that this creature    this is a moth    this is the moth in its pupa stage  and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology  so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth  it is already prewired. The wires are already in its body  and they can just hook it up to their technology  and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance. They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones. It's not just insects. This is the ratbot  or the robo rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate. Again  it's got technology    it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres  it's got a camera on top of its head. The scientists can make this creature go left  right. They have it running through mazes  controlling where it's going. They've now created an organic robot. The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar's lab said   Is this ethical  We've taken away the autonomy of this animal.  I'll get back to that in a minute. There's also been work done with monkeys. This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke. He took owl monkeys  wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved  especially looking at the movement of their right arm. The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways. They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm  which you see here in the picture  put the arm in another room. Pretty soon  the computer learned  by reading the monkey's brainwaves  to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did. Then he put a video monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm  and the monkey got fascinated. The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm  this prosthetic arm would do. And eventually she was moving it and moving it  and eventually stopped moving her right arm and  staring at the screen  could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves    which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms. And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals. This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida. He took        and then        disaggregated rat neurons    so these are just individual neurons from rats    put them on a chip. They self aggregated into a network  became an integrated chip. And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator. So now we have organic computer chips made out of living  self aggregating neurons. Finally  Mussa Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact  independent lamprey eel brain. This is a brain from a lamprey eel. It is living    fully intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides  attached photosensitive sensors to the brain  put it into a cart    here's the cart  the brain is sitting there in the middle    and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart  when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart  the cart moves toward the light  when you turn it off  it moves away. It's photophilic. So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain. Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts  sitting there in its nutrient medium  I don't know  but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding. So  we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes. This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts. He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin  put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being. Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation. This is where we are in this process. Finally  not that long ago  Craig Venter created the first artificial cell  where he took a cell  took a DNA synthesizer  which is a machine  created an artificial genome  put it in a different cell    the genome was not of the cell he put it in    and that cell then reproduced as the other cell. In other words  that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent    it did not have an organic parent. And so  asks The Economist   The first artificial organism and its consequences.  So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that. But in fact  that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like. This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like. This is a DNA synthesizer  and here at the bottom are just bottles of A  T  C and G    the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain. And so  we need to ask ourselves some questions. For the first time in the history of this planet  we are able to directly design organisms. We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power  and it confers on us a responsibility. Is everything okay  Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want  Do we have free reign to design animals  Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say   Look  I want a dog. I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund  the body of a retriever  maybe some pink fur  and let's make it glow in the dark   Does industry get to create creatures who  in their milk  in their blood  and in their saliva and other bodily fluids  create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines  Do we get to create organic robots  where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings  And then the final step of this  once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings  what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then  It's already happening. It's not science fiction. We are not only already using these things in animals  some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies. We are now taking control of our own evolution. We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet. It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now. It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future. Thanks. I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities  or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again. We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons. These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning  and it will give you extra strength  and it will further enhance your speed  and it will help you  for instance  to manage your balance. It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine. But not only that    it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there. This is just not some blue sky thinking. To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier  that on average does carry about     lbs. on their backs  and they are being asked to carry more equipment. Obviously  this is resulting in some major complications    back injuries     percent of them    chronic back injuries. So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue. So let me now introduce to you HULC    or the Human Universal Load Carrier. Soldier  With the HULC exoskeleton  I can carry     lbs. over varied terrain for many hours. Its flexible design allows for deep squats  crawls and high agility movements. It senses what I want to do  where I want to go  and then augments my strength and endurance. Eythor Bender  We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device  this new exoskeleton this year. So this is for real. Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users  something that I'm particularly passionate about. There are    million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide. This is about one percent of the total population. And that's actually a conservative estimate. We are talking here about  oftentimes  very young individuals with spinal cord injuries  that in the prime of their life      s    s    s    hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option. But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers. And the only option  pretty much    when it's stroke or other complications    is the wheelchair. And that is actually for the last     years  since its very successful introduction  I must say. So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility. Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that    years ago was spinal cord injured  and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for    years until now. Amanda Boxtel  Thank you. EB  Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. It has sensors. It's completely non invasive  sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back. There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips  as well as her knee joints  that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait. AB  I was    years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me. In a split second  I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis. Not long afterwards  a doctor strode into my hospital room  and he said   Amanda  you'll never walk again.  And that was    yeas ago. He robbed every ounce of hope from my being. Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again  to rock climb and even handcycle. But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk  until now. Thank you. EB  As you can see  we have the technology  we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you. It's in our hands  and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations    not only for the soldiers  or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users  but for everyone. AB  Thanks. Pep Rosenfeld  Folks  you've just met Claron McFadden. She is a world class soprano singer who studied in Rochester  New York. Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied. In August       Claron was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts  winning praise for her brilliance  her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality. Please welcome Claron McFadden. Claron McFadden  The human voice  mysterious  spontaneous  primal. For me  the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel    except  perhaps  jealousy. And the breath  the breath is the captain of that vessel. A child is born  takes its first breath    Whah  And we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression    mysterious  spontaneous and primal. A few years ago  I did a meditation retreat in Thailand. I wanted a place where I would have total silence and total solitude. I spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut    no music  no nothing    sounds of nature  trying to find the essence of concentration  being in the moment. On my last day  the woman who looked after the place  she came and we spoke for a minute  and then she said to me   Would you sing something for me   And I thought  but this is a place of total quiet and silence. I can't make noise. She said   Please  sing for me.  So I closed my eyes  I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was  Summertime   Porgy and Bess. Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high. Oh  your daddy's rich and your ma is good lookin'. So hush little baby  don't you cry. And I opened my eyes  and I saw that she had her eyes closed. And after a moment  she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said   It's like meditation.  And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for  to search for  I had it already in my singing    the calm  but alertness  the focus  but awareness  and being totally in the moment. When you're totally in the moment    when I'm totally in the moment  the vessel of expression is open. The emotions can flow from me to you and back. It's an extremely profound experience. There's a piece by a composer  an American composer called John Cage. It's called  Aria.  It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian. And the thing about this piece that's so special    if you see it behind me    it's not notated in any way. No notes  no flats  no sharps. But it's a kind of structure. And the singer  within this structure  has total freedom to be creative  spontaneous. For example  there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing    pop  country and western  opera  jazz    and you just have to be consistent with that color. You see there are different lines. You choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line  but you must respect it  more or less. And these little dots  these represent a sort of sound that's not a vocal  not a lyrical way of expressing the voice. Using the body    it could be sneezing  it could be coughing  animals    Exactly.  Laughter  Clapping  whatever. And there's different text. There's Armenian  Russian  French  English  Italian. So within this structure  one is free. To me  this piece is an ode to the voice  because it's mysterious  as we can see. It's quite spontaneous. And it's primal. So I would like to share this piece with you  It's  Aria   of John Cage. Hampart zoum Dirouhi Di questa Terra Naprasno Conscience et Tsk  tsk  tsk.

You think I've lost my way  and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat. I get that all the time in Dubai.  Here on holiday are you  dear    Come to visit the children  How long are you staying   Well actually  I hope for a while longer yet. I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over    years. And in that time  I have seen a lot of changes. Now that statistic is quite shocking. And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English. I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi. And one fine day  she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary. But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants  as well as their uses    medicinal uses  cosmetics  cooking  herbal. How did those students get all that knowledge  Of course  from their grandparents and even their great grandparents. It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations. But sadly  today  languages are dying at an unprecedented rate. A language dies every    days. Now  at the same time  English is the undisputed global language. Could there be a connection  Well I don't know. But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. When I first came out to the Gulf  I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post. Actually  not that long ago. That is a little bit too early. But nevertheless  I was recruited by the British Council  along with about    other teachers. And we were the first non Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait. We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education. And of course  the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth. Okay. Now this is the major change that I've seen    how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum  and no longer the sole domain of mother England  it has become a bandwagon for every English speaking nation on earth. And why not  After all  the best education    according to the latest World University Rankings    is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S. So everybody wants to have an English education  naturally. But if you're not a native speaker  you have to pass a test. Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone  Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius. Would he need the same language as a lawyer  for example  Well  I don't think so. We English teachers reject them all the time. We put a stop sign  and we stop them in their tracks. They can't pursue their dream any longer  'til they get English. Now let me put it this way  if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer  would I stop him from entering my British University  I don't think so. But indeed  that is exactly what we do. We English teachers are the gatekeepers. And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough. Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society. Maybe the barrier would be too universal. Okay.  But   I hear you say   what about the research  It's all in English.  So the books are in English  the journals are done in English  but that is a self fulfilling prophecy. It feeds the English requirement. And so it goes on. I ask you  what happened to translation  If you think about the Islamic Golden Age  there was lots of translation then. They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic  into Persian  and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages. And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe. Now don't get me wrong  I am not against teaching English  all you English teachers out there. I love it that we have a global language. We need one today more than ever. But I am against using it as a barrier. Do we really want to end up with     languages and the main one being English  or Chinese  We need more than that. Where do we draw the line  This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English  which is quite arbitrary. And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English  they didn't have to pass an English test. Case in point  Einstein. He  by the way  was considered remedial at school because he was  in fact  dyslexic. But fortunately for the world  he did not have to pass an English test. Because they didn't start until      with TOEFL  the American test of English. Now it's exploded. There are lots and lots of tests of English. And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. Now you might think  you and me   Those fees aren't bad  they're okay   but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. So immediately  we're rejecting them. It brings to mind a headline I saw recently   Education  The Great Divide.  Now I get it  I understand why people would want to focus on English. They want to give their children the best chance in life. And to do that  they need a Western education. Because  of course  the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities  that I put on earlier. It's a circular thing. Okay. Let me tell you a story about two scientists  two English scientists. They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. But they couldn't get the results they wanted. They really didn't know what to do  until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb  whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German. So bingo  problem solved. If you can't think a thought  you are stuck. But if another language can think that thought  then  by cooperating  we can achieve and learn so much more. My daughter came to England from Kuwait. She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic. It's an Arabic medium school. She had to translate it into English at her grammar school. And she was the best in the class at those subjects. Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad  we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know  and they know it in their own language. When a language dies  we don't know what we lose with that language. This is    I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently    they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village  like all the village children  because the kerosene lamp  it had smoke and it damaged his eyes. And anyway  there was never enough kerosene  because what does a dollar a day buy for you  So he invented a cost free solar lamp. And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home. When he received his award  he said these lovely words   The children can lead Africa from what it is today  a dark continent  to a light continent.  A simple idea  but it could have such far reaching consequences. People who have no light  whether it's physical or metaphorical  cannot pass our exams  and we can never know what they know. Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark. Let us celebrate diversity. Mind your language. Use it to spread great ideas. Thank you very much. The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple. We don't want Iran to get the bomb. Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The gray boxes that you see  these are real time control systems. Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves  we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge. The gray boxes don't run Windows software  they are a completely different technology. But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box  then we are in business. And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. So we start with a Windows dropper. The payload goes onto the gray box  damages the centrifuge  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed    mission accomplished. That's easy  huh  I want to tell you how we found that out. When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. The only thing that was known is it's very  very complex on the Windows part  the dropper part  used multiple zero day vulnerabilities. And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes  these real time control systems. So that got our attention  and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out. And then some very funny things happened. Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese    sniffed  but didn't want to eat. Didn't make sense to me. And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese  I realized  well  this is a directed attack. It's completely directed. The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target. And if not  Stuxnet does nothing. So that really got my attention  and we started to work on this nearly around the clock  because I thought   Well  we don't know what the target is. It could be  let's say for example  a U.S. power plant  or a chemical plant in Germany. So we better find out what the target is soon.  So we extracted and decompiled the attack code  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs    a smaller one and a bigger one. And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack. They probably even know the shoe size of the operator. So they know everything. And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high tech  let me tell you this  the payload is rocket science. It's way above everything that we have ever seen before. Here you see a sample of this actual attack code. We are talking about    around about        lines of code. Looks pretty much like old style assembly language. And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code. So what we were looking for is  first of all  system function calls  because we know what they do. And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world    to potential real world targets. So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. In order to get target theories  we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage  it must be a high value target and it is most likely located in Iran  because that's where most of the infections had been reported. Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. So I told my assistant   Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.  And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data. And that worked pretty well. So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control. The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge  that black object that you see. And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor  you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode. What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy    obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly. The big digital warhead    we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures. So for example  the number     really stands out in that code  you can't overlook it. I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade  and each cascade holds     centrifuges. So that made sense  that was a match. And it even got better. These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into     what is called  stages. And guess what we found in the attack code  An almost identical structure. So again  that was a real good match. And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. Now don't get me wrong here  it didn't go like this. These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor. And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover. Anyway  so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target  but from different angles. The small warhead is taking one cascade  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down  and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves. So in all  we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is. It is Natanz  and it is only Natanz. So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet. Here's some very cool stuff that we saw    really knocked my socks off. Down there is the gray box  and on the top you see the centrifuges. Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors    so for example  from pressure sensors and vibration sensors    and it provides legitimate program code  which is still running during the attack  with fake input data. And as a matter of fact  this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet. So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. That's cool  huh  The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room. It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough. So for example  in a power plant  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed  you must open relief valves within a millisecond. Obviously  this cannot be done by a human operator. So this is where we need digital safety systems. And when they are compromised  then real bad things can happen. Your plant can blow up. And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it. That's scary. But it gets worse. And this is very important  what I'm going to say. Think about this  this attack is generic. It doesn't have anything to do  in specifics  with centrifuges  with uranium enrichment. So it would work as well  for example  in a power plant or in an automobile factory. It is generic. And you don't have    as an attacker    you don't have to deliver this payload by a USB stick  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet. You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. Just spread it as wide as possible. And if you do that  what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction. That's the consequence that we have to face. So unfortunately  the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East. They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. So all of the green areas  these are your target rich environments. We have to face the consequences  and we better start to prepare right now. Thanks. Chris Anderson  I've got a question. Ralph  it's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this. Is that your opinion  Ralph Langner  Okay  you really want to hear that  Yeah. Okay. My opinion is that the Mossad is involved  but that the leading force is not Israel. So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower. There is only one  and that's the United States    fortunately  fortunately. Because otherwise  our problems would even be bigger. CA  Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you  Ralph. Adrian Kohler  Well  we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. Basil Jones  But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena. AK  The ancestor of the horse. Okay  we'll do something with it. Hahahaha. The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called  Faustus in Africa   a Handspring Production from       where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy. This production was directed by South African artist and theater director  William Kentridge. So it needed a very articulate front paw. But  like all puppets  it has other attributes. BJ  One of them is breath  and it kind of breathes. AK  Haa haa haaa. BJ  Breath is really important for us. It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage. It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet    AK  Oops. BJ  From an actor. Puppets always have to try to be alive. It's their kind of ur story onstage  that desperation to live. AK  Yeah  it's basically a dead object  as you can see  and it only lives because you make it. An actor struggles to die onstage  but a puppet has to struggle to live. And in a way that's a metaphor for life. BJ  So every moment it's on the stage  it's making the struggle. So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up to the minute   th century technology    to turn nouns into verbs. AK  Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life. BJ  Okay so. AK  It has ears that move passively when the head goes. BJ  And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood  covered with fabric    curiously similar  in fact  to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. AK  In Port Elizabeth  the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa. BJ  His mother was a puppeteer. And when we met at art school and fell in love in       I hated puppets. I really thought they were so beneath me. I wanted to become an avant garde artist    and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go. And  in fact  it took about    years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa  where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry  to learn a renewed  or a new  respect for this art form. AK  So in       I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company. And    years later  miraculously  we collaborated with a company from Mali  the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako  where we made a piece about a tall giraffe. It was just called  Tall Horse   which was a life sized giraffe. BJ  And here again  you see the same structure. The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane  but it's ultimately the same structure. It's got two people inside it on stilts  which give them the height  and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. AK  The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail  a bit like the hyena    same mechanism  just a bit bigger. And he's controlling the ear movement. BJ  So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London. And just around that time  his mother had said   Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'   AK  It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse. The horse is sold to the First World War  and he joins up to find his horse. BJ  So Tom gave us a call and said   Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre   AK  It seemed a lovely idea. BJ  But it had to ride. It had to have a rider. AK  It had to have a rider  and it had to participate in cavalry charges. A play about early   th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London. But they agreed to go along with it for a while. So we began with a test. BJ  This is Adrian and Thys Stander  who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse  and our next door neighbor Katherine  riding on a ladder. The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. AK  And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell  we knew that we might be able to make a horse  which could be ridden. So we made a model. This is a cardboard model  a little bit smaller than the hyena. You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there. BJ  And the two manipulators are inside. But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator  because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time. AK  We started work on the prototype after the model was approved  and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated. We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones. And we had a crate built for it. It had to be shipped to London. We were going to test drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town  and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. BJ  So we got a camera  and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances. And we sent it off to the National Theatre  hoping that they believed that we created something that worked. AK  A month later  we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. BJ  About    people. AK  We were terrified. We opened the lid  we took the horse out  and it did work  it walked and it was able to be ridden. Here I have an    second clip of the very first walk of the prototype. This is in the National Theatre studio  the place where they cook new ideas. It had by no means got the green light yet. The choreographer  Toby Sedgwick  invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse  which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs  grew up into the big horse. And Nick Starr  the director of the National Theatre  saw that particular moment  he was standing next to me    he nearly wet himself. And so the show was given the green light. And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely. Here is the plan. And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses. You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there. The horses are completely handmade. There is very little   th century technology in them. We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces. But because they have to be light and flexible  and each one of them is different  they can't be mass produced  unfortunately. So here are some half finished horses ready to be worked in London. And now we would like to introduce you to Joey. Joey boy  you there  Joey. Joey. Joey  come here. No  no  I haven't got it. He's got it  it's in his pocket. BJ  Joey. AK  Joey  Joey  Joey  Joey. Come here. Stand here where people can see you. Move around. Come on. I'd just like to describe    I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated. Here  Craig is working the head. He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand. Each one of them operates either an ear  separately  or the head  up and down. But he also controls the head directly by using his hand. The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse. When they point right back  the horse is fearful or angry  depending upon what's going on in front of him  around him. Or  when he's more relaxed  the head comes down and the ears listen  either side. Horses' hearing is very important. It's almost more important than their eyesight. Over here  Tommy's got what you call the heart position. He's working the leg. You see the string tendon from the hyena  the hyena's front leg  automatically pulls the hoop up. Horses are so unpredictable. The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action. The hind legs have got the same action. BJ  And Mikey also has  in his fingers  the ability to move the tail from left to right  and up and down with the other hand. And together  there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression. AK  You want to say something about the breathing  BJ  We had a big challenge with breathing. Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that    because that's how a horse would breathe  with an expanded chest. But we realized that  if that were to be happening  you wouldn't  as an audience  see the breath. So he made a channel in here  and the chest moves up and down in that channel. So it's anti naturalistic really  the up and down movement  but it feels like breath. And it's very  very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees. AK  Other emotional stuff. If I were to touch the horse here on his skin  the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver. You'll notice  of course  that the puppet is made out of cane lines. And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice  that I was making a three dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space. But of course  it was the cane is light  the cane is flexible  the cane is durable and the cane is moldable. And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. The skin itself is made out of a see through nylon mesh  which  if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear  she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike. You see the skeletal structure of it. Or if you light it from above  it becomes more solid. Again  that was a practical consideration. The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out. They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production. And it's very much an in the moment activity that they're engaged in. It's three heads making one character. But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces. And plant. Thank you. And now just    All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. BJ  Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd. The sound that that very large chest makes  of the horse    the whinnying and the nickering and everything    that starts usually with one performer  carries on with a second person and ends with a third. AK  Mikey Brett from Leicestershire. Mikey Brett  Craig  Leo  Zem Joaquin and Basil and me. Thank you. Thank you. As a boy  I loved cars. When I turned     I lost my best friend to a car accident. Like this. And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. Now I haven't succeeded  so this is just a progress report  but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self driving cars. I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self driving car that could navigate a desert. And even though a hundred teams were there  these cars went nowhere. So we decided at Stanford to build a different self driving car. We built the hardware and the software. We made it learn from us  and we set it free in the desert. And the unimaginable happened  it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge  winning Stanford   million dollars. Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. Since  our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves    any street in California. We've driven         miles. Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. It's the perfect driving mechanism. We've driven in cities  like in San Francisco here. We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway  . We've encountered joggers  busy highways  toll booths  and this is without a person in the loop  the car just drives itself. In fact  while we drove         miles  people didn't even notice. Mountain roads  day and night  and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco. Sometimes our cars get so crazy  they even do little stunts. What  Second Man  It's driving itself. Sebastian Thrun  Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life  but I can do something for all the people who died. Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people  And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error  and can therefore be prevented by machines  Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane    improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes  and do away with all traffic jams on highways  Do you realize that you  TED users  spend an average of    minutes per day in traffic  wasting your time on your daily commute  You could regain this time. This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone. And it's  .  billion gallons of gasoline wasted. Now I think there's a vision here  a new technology  and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. Thank you. I wanted to be a rock star. I dreamed of it  and that's all I dreamed of. To be more accurate  I wanted to be a pop star. This was in the late '  s. And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran. They wouldn't have me. I didn't read music  but I played synthesizers and drum machines. And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada. And I was certain that's what my life would be. And when I went to college at the University of Nevada  Las Vegas when I was     I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star      or even a degree program for that interest. And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir. And I said   Yes  I would love to do that. It sounds great.  And I left the room and said   No way.  The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky  and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people. And about a week later  a friend of mine came to me and said   Listen  you've got to join choir. At the end of the semester  we're taking a trip to Mexico  all expenses paid. And the soprano section is just full of hot girls.  And so I figured for Mexico and babes  I could do just about anything. And I went to my first day in choir  and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing. They opened their scores  the conductor gave the downbeat  and boom  they launched into the Kyrie from the  Requiem  by Mozart. In my entire life I had seen in black and white  and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor. The most transformative experience I've ever had    in that single moment  hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing  people together  the shared vision. And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself. And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section  as it turns out. I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life. I had learned to read music by then  or slowly learning to read music. And that piece was published  and then I wrote another piece  and that got published. And then I started conducting  and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School. And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor. Well a couple of years ago  a friend of mine emailed me a link  a YouTube link  and said   You have got to see this.  And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me  singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called  Sleep.  My name is Britlin Losee  and this is a video that I'd like to make for you. Here's me singing  Sleep.  I'm a little nervous  just to let you know.   If there are noises     in the night   Eric Whitacre  I was thunderstruck. Britlin was so innocent and so sweet  and her voice was so pure. And I even loved seeing behind her  I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room. Such an intimate video. And I had this idea  if I could get    people to all do this same thing  sing their parts    soprano  alto  tenor and bass    wherever they were in the world  post their videos to YouTube  we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir. So I wrote on my blog   OMG OMG.  I actually wrote   OMG   hopefully for the last time in public ever. And I sent out this call to singers. And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year      called  Lux Aurumque   which means  light and gold.  And lo and behold  people started uploading their videos. Now I should say  before that  what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting. And it's in complete silence when I filmed it  because I was only hearing the music in my head  imagining the choir that would one day come to be. Afterwards  I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to. And then as the videos started to come in ... This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore. This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts. Stephen Hanson from Sweden. This is Jamal Walker from Dallas  Texas. There was even a little soprano solo in the piece  and so I had auditions. And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts. I was told later  and also by lots of singers who were involved in this  that they sometimes recorded    or    different takes until they got just the right take    they uploaded it. Here's our winner of the soprano solo. This is Melody Myers from Tennessee. I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note    like   No problem  everything's fine.  And from the crowd emerged this young man  Scott Haines. And he said   Listen  this is the project I've been looking for my whole life. I'd like to be the person to edit this all together.  I said   Thank you  Scott. I'm so glad that you found me.  And Scott aggregated all of the videos. He scrubbed the audio. He made sure that everything lined up. And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago. This is  Lux Aurumque  sung by the Virtual Choir. I'll stop it there in the interest of time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So there's more. There's more. Thank you so much. And I had the same reaction you did. I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it. I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it    these souls all on their own desert island  sending electronic messages in bottles to each other. And the video went viral. We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it. And because of that  then a lot of singers started saying   All right  what's Virtual Choir  .    And so I decided for Virtual Choir  .  that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing   Sleep   which is another work that I wrote in the year         poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri. And again  I posted a conductor video  and we started accepting submissions. This time we got some more mature members. And some younger members.   Safe in bed   EW  That's Georgie from England. She's only nine. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen  Someone did all eight videos    a bass even singing the soprano parts. This is Beau Awtin. EW  And our goal    it was sort of an arbitrary goal    there was an MTV video where they all sang  Lollipop  and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody. And there were     people involved in that. So I told the singers   That's our goal. That's the number for us to beat.  And we just closed submissions January   th  and our final tally was       videos from    different countries. Thank you. From Malta  Madagascar  Thailand  Vietnam  Jordan  Egypt  Israel  as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand. And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials  what it was like for them  their experience singing it. And I've just chosen a few of them here.  My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly. Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling. It's so wonderful to sing together again   I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.  Aside from the beautiful music  it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before  but who are connected anyway.  And my personal favorite   When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this  he told me that I did not have the voice for it.  Yeah  I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too. Me too.  It hurt so much  and I shed some tears  but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words. It is a dream come true to be part of this choir  as I've never been part of one. When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map  I had to go with the nearest city  which is about     miles away from where I live. As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush  satellite is my connection to the world.  So two things struck me deeply about this. The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other. It doesn't matter the technology. And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection. It wasn't a virtual choir. There are people now online that are friends  they've never met. But  I know myself too  I feel this virtual esprit de corps  if you will  with all of them. I feel a closeness to this choir    almost like a family. What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at  Sleep  by Virtual Choir  . . This will be a premiere today. We're not finished with the video yet. You can imagine  with       synchronized YouTube videos  the render time is just atrocious. But we do have the first three minutes. And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first. You're the very first people to see this. This is  Sleep   the Virtual Choir.   beneath the moon     A silver thread on darkened dune     With closing eyes and resting head     I know that sleep is coming soon     Upon my pillow      safe in bed      a thousand pictures fill my head     I cannot sleep     my mind's aflight     and yet my limbs seem made of lead     If there are noises in the night   Eric Whitacre  Thank you very  very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a huge believer in hands on education. But you have to have the right tools. If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics  I'm not going to give her a soldering iron. And similarly  she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands. So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of  Play Doh. And so we spent a summer looking at different Play Doh recipes. And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play dough    pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen. We have two favorite recipes    one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt. And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these. But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together. You see that really salty Play Doh  Well  it conducts electricity. And this is nothing new. It turns out that regular Play Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity  and high school physics teachers have used that for years. But our homemade play dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play Doh. And that sugar dough  Well it's     times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. So what does that mean  Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits    circuits that the most creative  tiny  little hands can build on their own. And so I want to do a little demo for you. So if I take this salt dough  again  it's like the play dough you probably made as kids  and I plug it in    it's a two lead battery pack  simple battery pack  you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else    we can actually then light things up. But if any of you have studied electrical engineering  we can also create a short circuit. If I push these together  the light turns off. Right  the current wants to run through the play dough  not through that LED. If I separate them again  I have some light. Well now if I take that sugar dough  the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. It's like a wall to the electricity. If I place that between  now all the dough is touching  but if I stick that light back in  I have light. In fact  I could even add some movement to my sculptures. If I want a spinning tail  let's grab a motor  put some play dough on it  stick it on and we have spinning. And once you have the basics  we can make a slightly more complicated circuit. We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids. I plug in again the power to it. And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits. I can start plugging in lots of lights. And we can start talking about things like electrical load. What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor  It'll dim. We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done. You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this. So this is all in your home kitchen. We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab. We have a website  it's all there. These are the home recipes. We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves. And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone. We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids  to a science researcher in the U.K.  and curriculum developers in Hawaii. So I would encourage you all to grab some Play Doh  grab some salt  grab some sugar and start playing. We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers  but maybe we should. Have fun. Thank you. Ten years ago  on a Tuesday morning  I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg  North Carolina. It was a routine training jump  like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper    years before. We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early. You do some routine refresher training  and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you. And you put on the T    parachute. And you're very careful how you put the straps  particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs. And then you put on your reserve  and then you put on your heavy rucksack. And then a jumpmaster comes  and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations. He checks you out  he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed  your shoulders are crushed down  and  of course  he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well. Then you sit down  and you wait a little while  because this is the Army. Then you load the aircraft  and then you stand up and you get on  and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this  in a line of people  and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft. And you wait a little bit longer  because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait. Then you take off. And it's painful enough now    and I think it's designed this way    it's painful enough so you want to jump. You didn't really want to jump  but you want out. So you get in the aircraft  you're flying along  and at    minutes out  these jumpmasters start giving you commands. They give    minutes    that's a time warning. You sit there  OK. Then they give you    minutes. And of course  you're responding with all of these. And that's to boost everybody's confidence  to show that you're not scared. Then they give you   Get ready.  Then they go   Outboard personnel  stand up.  If you're an outboard personnel  now you stand up. If you're an inboard personnel  stand up. And then you hook up  and you hook up your static line. And at that point  you think   Hey  guess what  I'm probably going to jump. There's no way to get out of this at this point.  You go through some additional checks  and then they open the door. And this was that Tuesday morning in September  and it was pretty nice outside. So nice air comes flowing in. The jumpmasters start to check the door. And then when it's time to go  a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes   Go.  The first guy goes  and you're just in line  and you just kind of lumber to the door. Jump is a misnomer  you fall. You fall outside the door  you're caught in the slipstream. The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position    head down in your chest  your arms extended  put over your reserve parachute. You do that because     years before  an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that. I have no idea whether it makes any difference  but he seemed to make sense  and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong. And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open. If you don't get an opening shock  you don't get a parachute    you've got a whole new problem set. But typically you do  typically it opens. And of course  if your leg straps aren't set right  at that point you get another little thrill. Boom. So then you look around  you're under a canopy and you say   This is good.  Now you prepare for the inevitable. You are going to hit the ground. You can't delay that much. And you really can't decide where you hit very much  because they pretend you can steer  but you're being delivered. So you look around  where you're going to land  you try to make yourself ready. And then as you get close  you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line  so that it's not on you when you land  and you prepare to do a parachute landing fall. Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance    the toes of your feet  your calves  your thighs  your buttocks and your push up muscles. It's this elegant little land  twist and roll. And that's not going to hurt. In    some years of jumping  I never did one. I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window. And as soon as I hit  the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed. I'd shake my head  and I'd ask myself the eternal question   Why didn't I go into banking   And I'd look around  and then I'd see another paratrooper  a young guy or girl  and they'd have pulled out their M  carbine and they'd be picking up their equipment. They'd be doing everything that we had taught them. And I realized that  if they had to go into combat  they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders. And I realized that  if they came out of combat  it would be because we led them well. And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did. So now I do that Tuesday morning jump  but it's not any jump    that was September   th      . And when we took off from the airfield  America was at peace. When we landed on the drop zone  everything had changed. And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very  very real    and leadership seemed important. But things had changed  I was a    year old brigadier general. I'd been successful  but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes  and on that morning  I didn't know it. I was raised with traditional stories of leadership  Robert E. Lee  John Buford at Gettysburg. And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership. This was my father in Vietnam. And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful  they didn't lie  cheat  steal or abandon their comrades. And I still believe real leaders are like that. But in my first    years of career  I had a bunch of different experiences. One of my first battalion commanders  I worked in his battalion for    months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile    of a    mile road march  and he chewed my ass for about    seconds. And I'm not sure that was real interaction. But then a couple of years later  when I was a company commander  I went out to the National Training Center. And we did an operation  and my company did a dawn attack    you know  the classic dawn attack  you prepare all night  move to the line of departure. And I had an armored organization at that point. We move forward  and we get wiped out    I mean  wiped out immediately. The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it. And after the battle  they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an  after action review  to teach you what you've done wrong. Sort of leadership by humiliation. They put a big screen up  and they take you through everything   and then you didn't do this  and you didn't do this  etc.  I walked out feeling as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut. And I saw my battalion commander  because I had let him down. And I went up to apologize to him  and he said   Stanley  I thought you did great.  And in one sentence  he lifted me  put me back on my feet  and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure. When      came     year old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world. First  the things that are obvious  that you're familiar with  the environment changed    the speed  the scrutiny  the sensitivity of everything now is so fast  sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it. But everything we do is in a different context. More importantly  the force that I led was spread over more than    countries. And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them  I'm now leading a force that's dispersed  and I've got to use other techniques. I've got to use video teleconferences  I've got to use chat  I've got to use email  I've got to use phone calls    I've got to use everything I can  not just for communication  but for leadership. A    year old individual operating alone  thousands of miles from me  has got to communicate to me with confidence. I have to have trust in them and vice versa. And I also have to build their faith. And that's a new kind of leadership for me. We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations. An emerging opportunity came    didn't have time to get everybody together. So we had to get complex intelligence together  we had to line up the ability to act. It was sensitive  we had to go up the chain of command  convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium. We failed. The mission didn't work. And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force  rebuild their confidence    me and them  and them and me  and our seniors and us as a force    all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder. Entirely new requirement. Also  the people had changed. You probably think that the force that I led was all steely eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons. In reality  much of the force I led looked exactly like you. It was men  women  young  old    not just from military  from different organizations  many of them detailed to us just from a handshake. And so instead of giving orders  you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose. Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference  the ages  had changed so much. I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan  and on that operation  a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team. We talked about the operation  and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that. I asked   Where were you on        And one young Ranger in the back    his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind    he said   Sir  I was in the sixth grade.  And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness  and yet he has different experiences  in many cases a different vocabulary  a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders. And yet  we need to have that shared sense. It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise  because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot  that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore. So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing  And it's a brand new leadership challenge. And it forced me to become a lot more transparent  a lot more willing to listen  a lot more willing to be reverse mentored from lower. And yet  again  you're not all in one room. Then another thing. There's an effect on you and on your leaders. There's an impact  it's cumulative. You don't reset  or recharge your battery every time. I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces. And I remembered his son was in our force. And I said   John  where's your son  And how is he   And he said   Sir  he's fine. Thanks for asking.  I said   Where is he now   And he pointed at the screen  he said   He's in that firefight.  Think about watching your brother  father  daughter  son  wife in a firefight in real time and you can't do anything about it. Think about knowing that over time. And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders. And you have to watch and take care of each other. I probably learned the most about relationships. I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together. I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment. And every morning in the Ranger regiment  every Ranger    and there are more than       of them    says a six stanza Ranger creed. You may know one line of it  it says   I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy.  And it's not a mindless mantra  and it's not a poem. It's a promise. Every Ranger promises every other Ranger   No matter what happens  no matter what it costs me  if you need me  I'm coming.  And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger. Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful. It's probably more powerful than marriage vows. And they've lived up to it  which gives it special power. And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing. And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever. We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in       and an old friend of mine  that I had spent many years at various points of my career with    godfather to one of their kids    he sent me a note  just in an envelope  that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said   I knew if I ever got in a tight spot  that you would come  if alive.  And having that kind of relationship  for me  turned out to be critical at many points in my career. And I learned that you have to give that in this environment  because it's tough. That was my journey. I hope it's not over. I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right  they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust. This isn't easy stuff. It's not like that electronic abs machine where     minutes a month  you get washboard abs. And it isn't always fair. You can get knocked down  and it hurts and it leaves scars. But if you're a leader  the people you've counted on will help you up. And if you're a leader  the people who count on you need you on your feet. Thank you. So what does the happiest man in the world look like  He certainly doesn't look like me. He looks like this. His name is Matthieu Ricard. So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world  Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain. And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI  versus the right prefrontal cortex. And Matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts. He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. Which leads us to a question  What was he thinking when he was being measured  Perhaps something very naughty. Actually  he was meditating on compassion. Matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever. Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life. My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime    and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale. And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work. Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore. Compassion is something that creates happiness. Compassion is fun. And that mind blowing insight changes the entire game. Because if compassion was a chore  nobody's going to do it  except maybe the Dalai Lama or something. But if compassion was fun  everybody's going to do it. Therefore  to create the conditions for global compassion  all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun. But fun is not enough. What if compassion is also profitable  What if compassion is also good for business  Then  every boss  every manager in the world  will want to have compassion    like this. That would create the conditions for world peace. So  I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting. Fortunately  I didn't have to look very far. Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes    in Google  my company. I know there are other compassionate companies in the world  but Google is the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for    years  so I'll use Google as the case study. Google is a company born of idealism. It's a company that thrives on idealism. And maybe because of that  compassion is organic and widespread company wide. In Google  expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern. It's sort of a funny pattern. It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something. And they don't usually ask for permission  they just go ahead and do it  and then other Googlers join in  and it just gets bigger and bigger. And sometimes it gets big enough to become official. So in other words  it almost always starts from the bottom up. And let me give you some examples. The first example is the largest annual community event    where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities    was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official  because it just became too big. Another example  three Googlers    a chef  an engineer and  most funny  a massage therapist    three of them  they learned about a region in India where         people live without a single medical facility. So what do they do  They just go ahead and start a fundraiser. And they raise enough money to build this hospital    the first hospital of its kind for         people. During the Haiti earthquake  a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones. And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices. In China for example  one mid level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China  involving more than       schools in China  working on issues such as education  poverty  health care and the environment. There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. And this idea  again  came from the grassroots  from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job. And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy. It was two persons saying   Let's do this   and the company said   Yes.  So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company  because Googlers found compassion to be fun. But again  fun is not enough. There are also real business benefits. So what are they  The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders. What does that mean  There are three components of compassion. There is the affective component  which is   I feel for you.  There is the cognitive component  which is   I understand you.  And there is a motivational component  which is   I want to help you.  So what has this got to do with business leadership  According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins  and documented in the book  Good to Great   it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness. And he calls them  Level   leaders.  These are leaders who  in addition to being highly capable  possess two important qualities  and they are humility and ambition. These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good. And because they're ambitious for a greater good  they feel no need to inflate their own egos. And they  according to the research  make the best business leaders. And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion  we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion    understanding people and empathizing with people    inhibits  tones down  what I call the excessive self obsession that's in us  therefore creating the conditions for humility. The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good. In other words  compassion is the way to grow Level   leaders. And this is the first compelling business benefit. The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce. Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good. It creates a vibrant  energetic community where people admire and respect each other. I mean  you come to work in the morning  and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India. It's like how can you not be inspired by those people    your own coworkers  So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration  initiative and creativity. It makes us a highly effective company. So  having said all that  what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting  In our experience  there are three ingredients. The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good. So always think  how is your company and your job serving the greater good  Or  how can you further serve the greater good  This awareness of serving the greater good is very self inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in. That's one. The second ingredient is autonomy. So in Google  there's a lot of autonomy. And one of our most popular managers jokes that  this is what he says   Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum.  And he considers himself one of the inmates. If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free  they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way. The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth. Leadership training in Google  for example  places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities  such as self awareness  self mastery  empathy and compassion  because we believe that leadership begins with character. We even created a seven week curriculum on emotion intelligence  which we jokingly call  Searching Inside Yourself.  It's less naughty than it sounds. So I'm an engineer by training  but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course  which I find kind of funny  because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence. What a company. So  Search Inside Yourself     how does it work  It works in three steps. The first step is attention training. Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. Therefore  any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training. The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence. The second step follows the first step. The second step is developing self knowledge and self mastery. So using the supercharged attention from step one  we create a high resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes. What does that mean  It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity  objectivity and from a third person perspective. And once you can do that  you create the kind of self knowledge that enables self mastery. The third step  following the second step  is to create new mental habits. What does that mean  Imagine this. Imagine whenever you meet any other person  any time you meet a person  your habitual  instinctive first thought is   I want you to be happy. I want you to be happy.  Imagine you can do that. Having this habit  this mental habit  changes everything at work. Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people  and it creates trust  and trust creates a lot of good working relationships. And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace. Someday  we hope to open source  Search Inside Yourself  so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference. And in closing  I want to end the same place I started  with happiness. I want to quote this guy    the guy in robes  not the other guy    the Dalai Lama  who said   If you want others to be happy  practice compassion. If you want to be happy  practice compassion.  I found this to be true  both on the individual level and at a corporate level. And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too. Thank you. I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous. I went to prison    difficult. I worked in a coal mine    dangerous. I filmed in war zones    difficult and dangerous. And I spent    days eating nothing but this    fun in the beginning  little difficult in the middle  very dangerous in the end. In fact  most of my career  I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging  that make them interesting  that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience. So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship  I knew I would want to do something a little different. So as some of you may or may not have heard  a couple weeks ago  I took out an ad on eBay. I sent out some Facebook messages  some Twitter messages  and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my      TED Talk. That's right  some lucky individual  corporation  for profit or non profit  was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity    because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again    to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now  that at the time didn't have a title  didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be. So what you were getting was this  Your name here presents  My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and  depending on the content  could ultimately blow up in your face  especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it. But that being said  it's a very good media opportunity. You know how many people watch these TED Talks  It's a lot. That's just a working title  by the way. So even with that caveat  I knew that someone would buy the naming rights. Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago  I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty. But in the new project that I'm working on  my new film  we examine the world of marketing  advertising. And as I said earlier  I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years  but nothing could prepare me  nothing could ready me  for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. You see  I had this idea for a movie. all about product placement  marketing and advertising  where the entire film is funded by product placement  marketing and advertising. So the movie will be called  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  So what happens in  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold   is that everything from top to bottom  from start to finish  is branded from beginning to end    from the above the title sponsor that you'll see in the movie  which is brand X. Now this brand  the Qualcomm Stadium  the Staples Center ... these people will be married to the film in perpetuity    forever. And so the film explores this whole idea     Michael Kassan  It's redundant.  It's what   MK  It's redundant.  In perpetuity  forever  I'm a redundant person.  MK  I'm just saying.  That was more for emphasis. It was   In perpetuity. Forever.  But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor  but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ... the greatest car you ever drove from  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold   the greatest drink you've ever had  courtesy of  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  Xavier Kochhar  So the idea is  beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life  but actually get them to finance the film   MS  Get them to finance the film.  MS  And actually we show the whole process of how does it work. The goal of this whole film is transparency. You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie. So that's the whole concept  the whole film  start to finish. And I would love for CEG to help make it happen. Robert Friedman  You know it's funny  because when I first hear it  it is the ultimate respect for an audience. Guy  I don't know how receptive people are going to be to it  though. XK  Do you have a perspective    I don't want to use  angle  because that has a negative connotation    but do you know how this is going to play out   MS  No idea.  David Cohn  How much money does it take to do this  MS   .  million.  DC  Okay.  John Kamen  I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them  but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big  really obvious brands. XK  Who knows  maybe by the time your film comes out  we look like a bunch of blithering idiots. MS  What do you think the response is going to be  Stuart Ruderfer  The responses mostly will be  no.  MS  But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me  JK  Both. MS  ... Meaning not so optimistic. So  sir  can you help me  I need help. MK  I can help you. MS  Okay.  MK  Good.  Awesome. MK  We've gotta figure out which brands. MS  Yeah.  MK  That's the challenge.  When you look at the people you deal with .. MK  We've got some places we can go.  MS  Okay.  Turn the camera off. MS  I thought  Turn the camera off  meant   Let's have an off the record conversation.  Turns out it really means   We want nothing to do with your movie.  MS  And just like that  one by one  all of these companies suddenly disappeared. None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. I was amazed. They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project. And I was blown away  because I thought the whole concept  the idea of advertising  was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible  to get as many people to see it as possible. Especially in today's world  this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape  isn't the idea to get that new buzz worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses  No  that's what I thought. But the problem was  you see  my idea had one fatal flaw  and that flaw was this. Actually no  that was not the flaw whatsoever. That wouldn't have been a problem at all. This would have been fine. But what this image represents was the problem. See  when you do a Google image search for transparency  this is     This is one of the first images that comes up. So I like the way you roll  Sergey Brin. No. This is was the problem  transparency    free from pretense or deceit  easily detected or seen through  readily understood  characterized by visibility or accessibility of information  especially concerning business practices    that last line being probably the biggest problem. You see  we hear a lot about transparency these days. Our politicians say it  our president says it  even our CEO's say it. But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality  something suddenly changes. But why  Well  transparency is scary    like that odd  still screaming bear. It's unpredictable    like this odd country road. And it's also very risky. What else is risky  Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip. That's very risky. Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story  and they said   No  we want you to tell a story. We want you to tell a story  but we just want to tell our story.  See  when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie    and there he is giving me the look he often gave me    he would say   Son  there's three sides to every story. There's your story  there's my story and there's the real story.  Now you see  with this film  we wanted to tell the real story. But with only one company  one agency willing to help me    and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years    I realized that I would have to go on my own  I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team. So what you suddenly started to realize    or what I started to realize    is that when you started having conversations with these companies  the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem. and I have friends who make little independent films like I make. And the friends of mine who make big  giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have. And then my friends who make small independent films say   Well  how are we supposed to compete with these big  giant Hollywood movies   And the movie is called  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  So how specifically will we see Ban in the film  Any time I'm ready to go  any time I open up my medicine cabinet  you will see Ban deodorant. While anytime I do an interview with someone  I can say   Are you fresh enough for this interview  Are you ready  You look a little nervous. I want to help you calm down. So maybe you should put some one before the interview.  So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents. Whether it's a  Floral Fusion  or a  Paradise Winds   they'll have their chance. We will have them geared for both male or female    solid  roll on or stick  whatever it may be. That's the two cent tour. So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five cent tour. Karen Frank  We are a smaller brand. Much like you talked about being a smaller movie  we're very much a challenger brand. So we don't have the budgets that other brands have. So doing things like this    you know  remind people about Ban    is kind of why were interested in it. MS  What are the words that you would use to describe Ban  Ban is blank. KF  That's a great question. Woman  Superior technology. MS  Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit. Man  We talk about bold  fresh. I think  fresh  is a great word that really spins this category into the positive  versus  fights odor and wetness.  It keeps you fresh. How do we keep you fresher longer    better freshness  more freshness  three times fresher. Things like that that are more of that positive benefit. MS  And that's a multi million dollar corporation. What about me  What about a regular guy  I need to go talk to the man on the street  the people who are like me  the regular Joes. They need to tell me about my brand. Man  Um  my brand  I don't know. I like really nice clothes. Woman    's revival meets skater punk  unless it's laundry day. MS  All right  what is brand Gerry  Gerry  Unique.  MS  Unique.  Man  I guess what kind of genre  style I am would be like dark glamor. I like a lot of black colors  a lot of grays and stuff like that. But usually I have an accessory  like sunglasses  or I like crystal and things like that too. Woman  If Dan were a brand  he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz. Man    The brand that I am is  I would call it casual fly. Woman    Part hippie  part yogi  part Brooklyn girl    I don't know. Man    I'm the pet guy. I sell pet toys all over the country  all over the world. So I guess that's my brand. In my warped little industry  that's my brand. Man    My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods. Man    Failed writer alcoholic brand. Is that something  Lawyer  I'm a lawyer brand. Tom  I'm Tom. MS  Well we can't all be brand Tom  but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly. And what I realized is I needed an expert. I needed somebody who could get inside my head  somebody who could really help me understand what they call your  brand personality.  And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg. They've helped companies like Nestle  Febreze  Hallmark discover that brand personality. If they could do it for them  surely they could do it for me. MS  I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family. A  So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are. MS  These are the people who shape the way I look at the world. A  Tell me about this world. MS  This world  I think your world is the world that you live in    like people who are around you  your friends  your family  the way you live your life  the job you do. All those things stemmed and started from one place  and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia. A  What's the next one you want to talk about  MS  The next one  This was the best day ever. A  How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are  MS  It's like  who do I want to be  I like things that are different. I like things that are weird. I like weird things. A  Tell me about the  why  phase    what does that do for us  What is the machete  What pupa stage are you in now  Why is it important to reboot  What does the red represent  Tell me a little bit about that part. ... A little more about you that is not who you are. What are some other metamorphoses that you've had  ... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on  MS  EEEEEE   A  Thank you.  No  thank you. A  Thanks for you patience.  MS  Great job.  A  Yeah.  MS  Thanks a lot.  All right. MS  Yeah  I don't know what's going to come of this. There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there. Lindsay Zaltman  The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct  but complementary sides to your brand personality    the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful play brand. Those are juxtaposed very nicely together. And I think there's almost a paradox with those. And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both. Most companies tend to    and it's human nature    to avoid things that they're not sure of  avoid fear  those elements  and you really embrace those  and you actually turn them into positives for you  and it's a neat thing to see. What other brands are like that  The first on here is the classic  Apple. And you can see here too  Target  Wii  Mini from the Mini Coopers  and JetBlue. Now there's playful brands and mindful brands  those things that have come and gone  but a playful  mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing. MS  A playful  mindful brand. What is your brand  If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity  your brand personality  what would you be  Are you an up attribute  Are you something that gets the blood flowing  Or are you more of a down attribute  Are you something that's a little more calm  reserved  conservative  Up attributes are things like being playful  being fresh like the Fresh Prince  contemporary  adventurous  edgy or daring like Errol Flynn  nimble or agile  profane  domineering  magical or mystical like Gandalf. Or are you more of a down attribute  Are you mindful  sophisticated like      Are you established  traditional  nurturing  protective  empathetic like the Oprah  Are you reliable  stable  familiar  safe  secure  sacred  contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda  Over the course of this film  we had     plus companies who were up and down companies saying   no   they didn't want any part of this project. They wanted nothing to do with this film  mainly because they would have no control  they would have no control over the final product. But we did get    brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control  who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell    stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind. They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing  as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing. We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising. In the entire city for the past five years  there's no billboards  there's no posters  there's no flyers  nothing. And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash strapped schools all across America. What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of  or I've had the most success in  are ones where I've interacted with things directly. And that's what these brands did. They cut out the middleman  they cut out their agencies and said   Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind. I'm going to deal directly with the artist. I'm going to work with him to create something different  something that's going to get people thinking  that's going to challenge the way we look at the world.  And how has that been for them  Has it been successful  Well  since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival  let's take a look. According to Burrelles  the movie premiered in January  and since then    and this isn't even the whole thing    we've had     million media impressions for this film. That's literally covering just like a two and a half week period. That's only online    no print  no TV. The film hasn't even been distributed yet. It's not even online. It's not even streaming. It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet. So ultimately  this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum. And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part. What I always believe is that if you take chances  if you take risks  that in those risks will come opportunity. I believe that when you push people away from that  you're pushing them more towards failure. I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse  then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged. I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks. We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them. Ultimately  moving forward  I think we have to embrace fear. We've got to put that bear in a cage. Embrace fear. Embrace risk. One big spoonful at a time  we have to embrace risk. And ultimately  we have to embrace transparency. Today  more than ever  a little honesty is going to go a long way. And that being said  through honesty and transparency  my entire talk   Embrace Transparency   has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC  who for        bought the naming rights on eBay. EMC  Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world. EMC presents   Embrace Transparency.  Thank you very much  guys. June Cohen  So  Morgan  in the name of transparency  what exactly happened to that         MS  That is a fantastic question. I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization  the Sapling Foundation    a check for        to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED. I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy. This guy's name is TEMPT. TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the   s. And he came up home from a run one day and said   Dad  my legs are tingling.  And that was the onset of ALS. So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. He only has use of his eyes. I was exposed to him. I have a company that does design and animation  so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony  TEMPT  and his cause. So I went and met with his brother and father and said   We're going to give you this money. What are you going to do with it   And his brother said   I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me.  And I said   Wait a second  isn't that    I've seen Stephen Hawking    don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices   And he said   No  unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance  you can't actually do that. These devices aren't accessible to people.  And I said   Well  how do you actually communicate   Has everyone seen the movie  The Diving Bell and the Butterfly   That's how they communicate    so run their finger along. I said   That's archaic. How can that be   So I showed up with the desire to just write a check  and instead  I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash. I committed to his brother and his father right then and there    I'm like   All right  here's the deal  Tony's going to speak  we're going to get him a machine  and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again. Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it.  So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that. I met these guys called GRL  Graffiti Research Lab  and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then  with a laser pointer  draw on it  and it just registers the negative space. So they go around and do art installations like this. All the things that go up there  they said there's a life cycle. First it starts with the sexual organs  then it starts with cuss words  then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art. But there was always a life cycle to their presentations. So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this  and we were like   Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things  why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again  Well that would be awesome.  So that started the journey. And about two years later  about a year later  after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around  we'd accomplished a couple things. One  we battered down the doors of the insurance companies  and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate    a Stephen Hawking machine. Which was awesome. And he's seriously one of the funniest    I call him Yoda  because you talk to the guy  you get an email from him  and you're like   I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing.  The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world    literally every corner of the world    into our house. My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage  and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house. A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls. But for over two weeks  we programmed  we went to the Venice boardwalk  my kids got involved  my dog got involved  and we created this. This is called the EyeWriter  and you can see the description. This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk  some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack. We took a PS  camera  hacked it open  mounted it to an LED light  and now there's a device that is free    you build this yourself  we publish the code for free  you download the software for free. And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations. There's no insurance company that can say  No.  There's no hospital that can say  No.  Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes. Thank you. Thank you guys very much. That was awesome. So at the end of the two weeks  we went back to TEMPT's room. I love this picture  because this is someone else's room and that's his room. So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling. And after over a year of planning  two weeks of programming  carb fest and all night sessions  Tony drew again for the first time in seven years. And this is an amazing picture  because this is his life support system  and he's looking over his life support system. We kicked his bed so that he could see out. And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital. And he drew again for the first time  in front of his family and friends    and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was. The funny thing was  we had to break into the parking lot too  so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too. So at the end of this  he sent us an email  and this is what the email said   That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years. I feel like I had been held underwater  and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe.  Isn't that awesome  So that's kind of our battle cry. That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing. And we've got such a long way to go with this. This is an amazing device  but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more. So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better  faster  stronger. Since that time  we've had all kinds of acknowledgment. We've won a bunch of awards. Remember  it's free  none of us are making any money on this thing. It's all coming out of our own pockets. So the awards were like   Oh  this is fantastic.  Armstrong Twittered about us  and then in December  Time magazine honored us as one of the top    inventions of       which was really cool. The coolest thing about this    and this is what's completing the whole circle    is that in April of this year  at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles  there's going to be an exhibition called  Art of the Streets.  And  Art of the Streets  is going to have pretty much the bad asses of the street art scene    Banksy  Shepard Fairey  KAWS    all of these guys will be there. TEMPT's going to be in the show  which is pretty awesome. So basically this is my point  If you see something that's not possible  make it possible. Everything in this room wasn't possible    this stage  this computer  this mic  the EyeWriter    wasn't possible at one point. Make it possible  everyone in this room. I'm not a programmer  never done anything with ocular recognition technology  but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen. And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done  if not now  then when  And if not me  then who  Thank you guys. Can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were     Do you know what I wanted to be  I wanted to be a biker chick. I wanted to race cars  and I wanted to be a cowgirl  and I wanted to be Mowgli from  The Jungle Book.  Because they were all about being free  the wind in your hair    just to be free. And on my seventeenth birthday  my parents  knowing how much I loved speed  gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday. Not that we could have afforded I drive  but to give me the dream of driving. And on my seventeenth birthday  I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence  as I always had all my life    my visually impaired sister    to go to see an eye specialist. Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters. And my little sister wanted to be a pilot    God help her. So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun. And on my seventeenth birthday  after my fake eye exam  the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday. And he said   So what are you going to do to celebrate   And I took that driving lesson  and I said   I'm going to learn how to drive.  And then there was a silence    one of those awful silences when you know something's wrong. And he turned to my mother  and he said   You haven't told her yet   On my seventeenth birthday  as Janis Ian would best say  I learned the truth at   . I am  and have been since birth  legally blind. And you know  how on earth did I get to    and not know that  Well  if anybody says country music isn't powerful  let me tell you this  I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song   A Boy Named Sue.  I'm the eldest of three. I was born in     . And very shortly after my birth  my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism. And what the hell does that mean to you  So let me just tell you  the great part of all of this  I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing  so holy God  woohoo   Laughter  I might buy some more time. But more importantly  let me tell you    I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out  Pat. Hey. See this hand  Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline. Every man in this room  even you  Steve  is George Clooney. And every woman  you are so beautiful. And when I want to look beautiful  I step three feet away from the mirror  and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting I've done all my life from all the dark lights. The really strange part is that  at three and a half  just before I was going to school  my parents made a bizarre  unusual and incredibly brave decision. No special needs schools. No labels. No limitations. My ability and my potential. And they decided to tell me that I could see. So just like Johnny Cash's Sue  a boy given a girl's name  I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive  when they were no longer there to protect me  or just take it all away. But more significantly  they gave me the ability to believe  totally  to believe that I could. And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things  a big fat  no   everybody imagines I was devastated. And don't get me wrong  because when I first heard it    aside from the fact that I thought he was insane    I got that thump in my chest  just that  huh   But very quickly I recovered. It was like that. The first thing I thought about was my mom  who was crying over beside me. And I swear to God  I walked out of his office   I will drive. I will drive. You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive.  And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child    he taught me how to sail  knowing I could never see where I was going  I could never see the shore  and I couldn't see the sails  and I couldn't see the destination. But he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face. And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive. And for the next    years  I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see  because I didn't want to be a failure  and I didn't want to be weak. And I believed I could do it. So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do. And I was an archeologist  and then I broke things. And then I managed a restaurant  and then I slipped on things. And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener. And then I went to business school. And you know  disabled people are hugely educated. And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture. And they didn't even know. And it's extraordinary how far belief can take you. In       two and a half years into that job  something happened. Wonderfully  my eyes decided  enough. And temporarily  very unexpectedly  they dropped. And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world  where you work hard  play hard  you gotta be the best  you gotta be the best. And two years in  I really could see very little. And I found myself in front of an HR manager in       saying something I never imagined that I would say. I was    years old. I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do. And I simply said   I'm sorry. I can't see  and I need help.  Asking for help can be incredibly difficult. And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that. We all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure. And it's frightening  isn't it  But all that belief had fueled me so long. And can I tell you  operating in the sighted world when you can't see  it's kind of difficult    it really is. Can I tell you  airports are a disaster. Oh  for the love of God. And please  any designers out there  OK  designers  please put up your hands  even though I can't even see you. I always end up in the gents' toilets. And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell. But can I just tell you  the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle. Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes  It's such a small thing  right  And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you're not  or to be somebody that you aren't  And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR  they sent me off to an eye specialist. And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life. But before I got to him  I was so lost. I had no idea who I was anymore. And that eye specialist  he didn't bother testing my eyes. God no  it was therapy. And he asked me several questions  of which many were   Why  Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself  And do you love what you do  Caroline   And you know  when you go to a global consulting firm  they put a chip in your head  and you're like   I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.   Laughter  To leave would be failure. And he said   Do you love it   I couldn't even speak I was so choked up. I just was so    how do I tell him  And then he said to me   What did you want to be when you were little   Now listen  I wasn't going to say to him   Well  I wanted to race cars and motorbikes.  Hardly appropriate at this moment in time. He thought I was mad enough anyway. And as I left his office  he called me back and he said   I think it's time. I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different.  And that door closed. And that silence just outside a doctor's office  that many of us know. And my chest ached. And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea. But I did know the game was up. And I went home  and  because the pain in my chest ached so much  I thought   I'll go out for a run.  Really not a very sensible thing to do. And I went on a run that I know so well. I know this run so well  by the back of my hand. I always run it perfectly fine. I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with. And there was a rock that I always missed. And I'd never fallen on it  never. And there I was crying away  and smash  bash on my rock. Broken  fallen over on this rock in the middle of March in       typical Irish weather on a Wednesday    gray  snot  tears everywhere  ridiculously self pitying. And I was floored  and I was broken  and I was angry. And I didn't know what to do. And I sat there for quite some time going   How am I going to get off this rock and go home  Because who am I going to be  What am I going to be   And I thought about my dad  and I thought   Good God  I'm so not Sue now.  And I kept thinking over and over in my mind  what had happened  Where did it go wrong  Why didn't I understand  And you know  the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers. I had lost my belief. Look where my belief had brought me to. And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see. I was crumpled. And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me   What do you want to be  What do you want to be  What did you want to be when you were little  Do you love what you do  Do something different. What do you want to be  Do something different. What do you want to be   And really slowly  slowly  slowly  it happened. And it did happen this way. And then the minute it came  it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart    something different.  Well  how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'  You don't get more different than that.  And the moment  and I mean the moment  the moment that hit me  I swear to God  it was like woo hoo  You know    something to believe in. And nobody can tell me no. Yes  you can say I can't be an archeologist. But you can't tell me  no  I can't be Mowgli  because guess what  Nobody's ever done it before  so I'm going to go do it. And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl  I'm just going to scoot. And so I got off that rock  and  oh my God  did I run home. And I sprinted home  and I didn't fall  and I didn't crash. And I ran up the stairs  and there was one of my favorite books of all time   Travels on My Elephant  by Mark Shand    I don't know if any of you know it. And I grabbed this book off  and I'm sitting on the couch going   I know what I'm going to do. I know how to be Mowgli. I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant. I'm going to be an elephant handler.  And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler. From global management consultant to elephant handler. I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant  get an elephant. I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue. But I knew I would. Because  when you make a decision at the right time and the right place  God  that universe makes it happen for you. Nine months later  after that day on snot rock  I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi. And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India. The most powerful thing of all  it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God  I did. But you know  I was believing in the wrong thing. Because I wasn't believing in me  really me  all the bits of me    all the bits of all of us. Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not  And you know what  when you really believe in yourself and everything about you  it's extraordinary what happens. And you know what  that trip  that thousand kilometers  it raised enough money for       cataract eye operations. Six thousand people got to see because of that. When I came home off that elephant  do you know what the most amazing part was  I chucked in my job at Accenture. I left  and I became a social entrepreneur  and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family  which deals with Asian elephant conservation. And I set up Kanchi  because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant  because disability is like the elephant in the room. And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way    no charity  no pity. But I wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible. It was extraordinary. That's what I wanted to do. And I never thought about noes anymore  or not seeing  or any of that kind of nothing. It just seemed that it was possible. And you know  the oddest part is  when I was on my way traveling here to TED  I'll be honest  I was petrified. And I speak  but this is an amazing audience  and what am I doing here  But as I was traveling here  you'll be very happy to know  I did use my white symbol stick cane  because it's really good to skip queues in the airport. And I got my way here being happily proud that I couldn't see. And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine  he texted me on the way over  knowing I was scared. Even though I present confident  I was scared. He said   Be you.  And so here I am. This is me  all of me. And I have learned  you know what  cars and motorbikes and elephants  that's not freedom. Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom. And I never needed eyes to see    never. I simply needed vision and belief. And if you truly believe    and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart    you can make change happen. And we need to make it happen  because every single one of us    woman  man  gay  straight  disabled  perfect  normal  whatever    everyone of us must be the very best of ourselves. I no longer want anybody to be invisible. We all have to be included. And stop with the labels  the limiting. Losing of labels  because we are not jam jars. We are extraordinary  different  wonderful people. Thank you. First  a video. Yes  it is a scrambled egg. But as you look at it  I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy. Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself. And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated. And now they're going to be poured back into the egg. And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works. A scrambled egg is mush    tasty mush    but it's mush. An egg is a beautiful  sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things  such as chickens. And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity. In fact  this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics  the second law of thermodynamics  or the law of entropy. What that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order  lack of structure    in fact  to mush. And that's why that video feels a bit strange. And yet  look around us. What we see around us is staggering complexity. Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone  there are some    billion SKUs  or distinct commodities  being traded. That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth. And they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals  who are linked by trade  travel  and the Internet into a global system of stupendous complexity. So here's a great puzzle  in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics  how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described  the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center  Well  the answer seems to be  the universe can create complexity  but with great difficulty. In pockets  there appear what my colleague  Fred Spier  calls  Goldilocks conditions     not too hot  not too cold  just right for the creation of complexity. And slightly more complex things appear. And where you have slightly more complex things  you can get slightly more complex things. And in this way  complexity builds stage by stage. Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe. We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments. And at each threshold  the going gets tougher. The complex things get more fragile  more vulnerable  the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent  and it's more difficult to create complexity. Now  we  as extremely complex creatures  desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law  and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility. And that's the story that we tell in big history. But to do it  you have do something that may  at first sight  seem completely impossible. You have to survey the whole history of the universe. So let's do it. Let's begin by winding the timeline back   .  billion years  to the beginning of time. Around us  there's nothing. There's not even time or space. Imagine the darkest  emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are. And then suddenly  bang  A universe appears  an entire universe. And we've crossed our first threshold. The universe is tiny  it's smaller than an atom. It's incredibly hot. It contains everything that's in today's universe  so you can imagine  it's busting. And it's expanding at incredible speed. And at first  it's just a blur  but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur. Within the first second  energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity. And energy does something else quite magical  it congeals to form matter    quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons. And all of that happens in the first second. Now we move forward         years. That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet. And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium. Now I want to pause for a moment          years after the origins of the universe  because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage. We know above all that it was extremely simple. It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms  and they have no structure. They're really a sort of cosmic mush. But that's not completely true. Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that  in fact  there are just tiny differences in that background. What you see here  the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas. These are tiny differences  but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity. And this is how it works. Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff. So where you get slightly denser areas  gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms. So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds. And each cloud is compacted  gravity gets more powerful as density increases  the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud  and then  at the center  the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of    million degrees  protons start to fuse  there's a huge release of energy  and    bam  We have our first stars. From about     million years after the Big Bang  stars begin to appear all through the universe  billions of them. And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex. Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds. When very large stars die  they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations  to form all the elements of the periodic table. If  like me  you're wearing a gold ring  it was forged in a supernova explosion. So now the universe is chemically more complex. And in a chemically more complex universe  it's possible to make more things. And what starts happening is that  around young suns  young stars  all these elements combine  they swirl around  the energy of the star stirs them around  they form particles  they form snowflakes  they form little dust motes  they form rocks  they form asteroids  and eventually  they form planets and moons. And that is how our solar system was formed  four and a half billion years ago. Rocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials. So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity. Now  the going gets tougher. The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile  significantly more vulnerable  but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity. I'm talking  of course  about living organisms. Living organisms are created by chemistry. We are huge packages of chemicals. So  chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force. That operates over smaller scales than gravity  which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets. Now  what are the ideal conditions for chemistry  What are the Goldilocks conditions  Well  first  you need energy  but not too much. In the center of a star  there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again. But not too little. In intergalactic space  there's so little energy that atoms can't combine. What you want is just the right amount  and planets  it turns out  are just right  because they're close to stars  but not too close. You also need a great diversity of chemical elements  and you need liquids  such as water. Why  Well  in gases  atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up. In solids  atoms are stuck together  they can't move. In liquids  they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules. Now  where do you find such Goldilocks conditions  Well  planets are great  and our early Earth was almost perfect. It was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water. And deep beneath those oceans  at cracks in the Earth's crust  you've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth  and you've got a great diversity of elements. So at those deep oceanic vents  fantastic chemistry began to happen  and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations. But of course  life is more than just exotic chemistry. How do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable  Well  it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick. You don't stabilize the individual  you stabilize the template  the thing that carries information  and you allow the template to copy itself. And DNA  of course  is the beautiful molecule that contains that information. You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA. Each rung contains information. So  DNA contains information about how to make living organisms. And DNA also copies itself. So  it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean. So the information spreads. Notice that information has become part of our story. The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections. As it copies itself  once in every billion rungs  there tends to be an error. And what that means is that DNA is  in effect  learning. It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work. So DNA's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity. And we can see this happening over the last four billion years. For most of that time of life on Earth  living organisms have been relatively simple    single cells. But they had great diversity  and  inside  great complexity. Then from about     to     million years ago  multi celled organisms appear. You get fungi  you get fish  you get plants  you get amphibia  you get reptiles  and then  of course  you get the dinosaurs. And occasionally  there are disasters. Sixty five million years ago  an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula  creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war  and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Terrible news for the dinosaurs  but great news for our mammalian ancestors  who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs. And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began    million years ago with the landing of an asteroid. Humans appeared about         years ago. And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story. Let me explain why. We've seen that DNA learns in a sense  it accumulates information. But it is so slow. DNA accumulates information through random errors  some of which just happen to work. But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning  it had produced organisms with brains  and those organisms can learn in real time. They accumulate information  they learn. The sad thing is  when they die  the information dies with them. Now what makes humans different is human language. We are blessed with a language  a system of communication  so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory. And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information  and it can accumulate from generation to generation. And that's why  as a species  we're so creative and so powerful  and that's why we have a history. We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift. I call this ability collective learning. It's what makes us different. We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history. We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa  but then you see humans migrating into new environments  into desert lands  into jungles  into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia    tough  tough environment    into the Americas  into Australasia. Each migration involved learning    learning new ways of exploiting the environment  new ways of dealing with their surroundings. Then        years ago  exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age  humans learned to farm. Farming was an energy bonanza. And exploiting that energy  human populations multiplied. Human societies got larger  denser  more interconnected. And then from about     years ago  humans began to link up globally through shipping  through trains  through telegraph  through the Internet  until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals. And that brain is learning at warp speed. And in the last     years  something else has happened. We've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels. So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us. So    Here we are  back at the convention center. We've been on a journey  a return journey  of   .  billion years. I hope you agree this is a powerful story. And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role. But it also contains warnings. Collective learning is a very  very powerful force  and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it. I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England  living through the Cuban Missile Crisis. For a few days  the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction. And the same weapons are still here  and they are still armed. If we avoid that trap  others are waiting for us. We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last        years. So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us  but it can also show us our power with collective learning. And now  finally    this is what I want. I want my grandson  Daniel  and his friends and his generation  throughout the world  to know the story of big history  and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us. And that's why a group of us are building a free  online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world. We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them  as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet. I thank you for your attention. How often do we hear that people just don't care  How many times have you been told that real  substantial change isn't possible because most people are too selfish  too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community  I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist  but rather  that people do care  but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way. And I'll give you some examples of what I mean. Let's start with city hall. You ever see one of these before  This is a newspaper ad. It's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what's happening. As you can see  it's impossible to read. You need to get halfway down to even find out which address they're talking about  and then farther down  in tiny    point font  to find out how to actually get involved. Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way    if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that. Now that would never happen. You'll never see an ad like that because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes. Whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process  otherwise their ads would look something like this    with all the information basically laid out clearly. As long as the city's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged  then of course people aren't going to be engaged. But that's not apathy  that's intentional exclusion. Public space. The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression. Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice  dominating the visual and mental environment. The problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren't profitable to say. So you're never going to see them on a billboard. The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change  mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals  but even when they do talk about important political issues  they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement. And I'll give you an example  the Now magazine from last week    progressive  downtown weekly in Toronto. This is the cover story. It's an article about a theater performance  and it starts with basic information about where it is  in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article    where  the time  the website. Same with this    it's a movie review  an art review  a book review    where the reading is in case you want to go. A restaurant    you might not want to just read about it  maybe you want to go to the restaurant. So they tell you where it is  what the prices are  the address  the phone number  etc. Then you get to their political articles. Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening. It talks about the candidates    written very well    but no information  no follow up  no websites for the campaigns  no information about when the debates are  where the campaign offices are. Here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign. The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat  maybe read a book  maybe see a movie  but not be engaged in their community. And you might think this is a small thing  but I think it's important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport. Heroes  How do we view leadership  Look at these    movies. What do they have in common  Anyone  They all have heroes who were chosen. Someone came up to them and said   You're the chosen one. There's a prophesy. You have to save the world.  And then someone goes off and saves the world because they've been told to  with a few people tagging along. This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about. A heroic effort is a collective effort  number one. Number two  it's imperfect  it's not very glamorous  and it doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end. It's an ongoing process your whole life. But most importantly  it's voluntary. It's voluntary. As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead  or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy  they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership  which is that it comes from within. It's about following your own dreams    uninvited  uninvited    and then working with others to make those dreams come true. Political parties  oh boy. Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics. Instead  they've become  sadly  uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing  pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas. And people can smell that  and it feeds cynicism. Charitable status  Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy. This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced  especially during election time. Which leads us to the last one  which is our elections. As you may have noticed  our elections in Canada are a complete joke. We use out of date systems that are unfair and create random results. Canada's currently led by a party that most Canadians didn't actually want. How can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don't count in Canada  You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic. It's like trying to run into a brick wall. Now I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what's in our way. Quite the opposite  I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care. But that  as I said  we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way. As long as we believe that people  our own neighbors  are selfish  stupid or lazy  then there's no hope. But we can change all those things I mentioned. We can open up city hall. We can reform our electoral systems. We can democratize our public spaces. My main message is  if we can redefine apathy  not as some kind of internal syndrome  but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement  and if we can clearly define  we can clearly identify  what those obstacles are  and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles  then anything is possible. Thank you. Roger Ebert  These are my words  but this is not my voice. This is Alex  the best computer voice I've been able to find  which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh. For most of my life  I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak. It was like breathing. In those days  I was living in a fool's paradise. After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak  eat or drink  I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me. For several days now  we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED. I used to be able to talk like that. Maybe I wasn't as smart  but I was at least as talkative. I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself  and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. However  I've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous. So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me. I will start with my wife  Chaz. Chaz Ebert  It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in       I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show  'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.' I had pre taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation. The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. My tongue  larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected. CE  I was optimistic  and all was right with the world. The first surgery was a great success. I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good. Two weeks later  I was ready to return home. I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song 'I'm Your Man' for my doctors and nurses. Suddenly  I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding. My carotid artery had ruptured. Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there. Chaz told me that if that song hadn't played for so long  I might have already been in the car  on the way home  and would have died right there and then. So thank you  Leonard Cohen  for saving my life. There was a second surgery    which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart. And then a third attempt  which also patched me back together pretty well  until it failed. A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. And before I left the hospital  after a year of being hospitalized  I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery. There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again  it just sort of became obvious. Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system. We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. Therefore  the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air. Because I had lost my jaw  I could no longer form a seal  and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless. Dean Ornish  At first for a long time  I wrote messages in notebooks. Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice. This was faster  and nobody had to try to read my handwriting. I tried out various computer voices that were available online  and for several months I had a British accent  which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.   It was the clearest I could find. Then Apple released the Alex voice  which was the best I'd heard. It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. When it saw a period  it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air. There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices  and I've experimented with them. For me  they share a fundamental problem  they're too slow. When I find myself in a conversational situation  I need to type fast and to jump right in. People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase. But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice  How does that affect who you are as a person  When people hear Alex speaking my words  do they experience a disconnect  Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next  How did I feel not being able to speak  I felt  and I still feel  a lot of distance from the human mainstream. I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop. Even then  I'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties. So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of    years. At first I was against it. I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer. There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. But I decided then to just give it a try. So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. They'd never made one from previously recorded materials. All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. But they were willing to give it a try. So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice  including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs. And it sounded like me  it really did. There was a reason for that  it was me. But it wasn't that simple. The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved    movie soundtracks  for example  or Gene Siskel arguing with me    and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough. I'll let you hear a sample of that voice. These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program. And here's the voice we call Roger Jr. or Roger  . . Roger  .   Oprah  I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show. We have been talking for a long time  and now here we are again. This is the first version of my computer voice. It still needs improvement  but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL     . When I heard it the first time  it sent chills down my spine. When I type anything  this voice will speak whatever I type. When I read something  it will read in my voice. I have typed these words in advance  as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on  Casablanca  and  Citizen Kane.  This is the first voice they've created for an individual. There are several very good voices available for computers  but they all sound like somebody else  while this voice sounds like me. I plan to use it on television  radio and the Internet. People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built in speaking systems. Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves. But I've got to say  in first grade  they said I talked too much  and now I still can. Roger Ebert  As you can hear  it sounds like me  but the words jump up and down. The flow isn't natural. The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice  and I'm optimistic about it. But so far  the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard. I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex. He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice. A very large sample is needed. John Hunter  All my life I was a motormouth. Now I have spoken my last words  and I don't even remember for sure what they were. I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled  I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.  On Wednesday  David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time span of the universe. For almost all of its millions and billions of years  there was no life on Earth at all. For almost all the years of life on Earth  there was no intelligent life. Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next  did civilization become possible. In cosmological terms  that was about    minutes ago. Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool  the computer. That has mostly happened in my lifetime. Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana  the birthplace of HAL     . When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday  about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world  I had a flashback. It was about     . As a local newspaper reporter still in high school  I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO. The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. This was a computer assisted instruction system  which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC. The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. I doubt  on that day    years ago  they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished. But that's not the point. The point is PLATO was only    years ago  an instant in time. It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers  until only five years ago. I have learned from Wikipedia that  starting with that humble beginning  PLATO established forums  message boards  online testing  email  chat rooms  picture languages  instant messaging  remote screen sharing and multiple player games. Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana  it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual  online universe we occupy today. But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce. I'm here as a man who wants to communicate. All of this has happened in my lifetime. I started writing on a computer back in the     s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun Times. I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model    's. And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections  they didn't know what I was talking about. When I bought my first desktop  it was a DEC Rainbow. Does anybody remember that    The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble. I joined CompuServe when it had fewer numbers than I currently have followers on Twitter. CE  All of this has happened in the blink of an eye. It is unimaginable what will happen next. It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history. Indeed  I am lucky to live in history at all  because without intelligence and memory there is no history. For billions of years  the universe evolved completely without notice. Now we live in the age of the Internet  which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. And because of it  I can communicate as well as I ever could. We are born into a box of time and space. We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others. For me  the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence. I cannot speak  I can only type so fast. Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated  but with my computer  I can communicate more widely than ever before. I feel as if my blog  my email  Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation. They aren't an improvement  but they're the best I can do. They give me a way to speak. Not everybody has the patience of my wife  Chaz. But online  everybody speaks at the same speed. This whole adventure has been a learning experience. Every time there was a surgery that failed  I was left with a little less flesh and bone. Now I have no jaw left at all. While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders  the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily. Ironic that my legs are fine  and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk. When you see me today  I look like the Phantom of the Opera. But no you don't. It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles. People    People talk loudly    I'm so sorry. Excuse me. People talk loudly and slowly to me. Sometimes they assume I am deaf. There are people who don't want to make eye contact. Believe me  he didn't mean this as    anyway  let me just read it. You should never let your wife read something like this. It is human nature to look away from illness. We don't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality. That's why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me. My ability to think and write have not been affected. And on the Web  my real voice finds expression. I have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way. One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes. One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple. Google him and he will make you laugh. All of these people are saying  in one way or another  that what you see is not all you get. So I have not come here to complain. I have much to make me happy and relieved. I seem  for the time being  to be cancer free. I am writing as well as ever. I am productive. If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago  I would be as isolated as a hermit. I would be trapped inside my head. Because of the rush of human knowledge  because of the digital revolution  I have a voice  and I do not need to scream. RE  Wait. I have one more thing to add. A guy goes into a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist says   You're crazy.  The guy says   I want a second opinion.  The psychiatrist says   All right  you're ugly.  You all know the test for artificial intelligence    the Turing test. A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer. If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human  the machine has passed the test. I now propose a test for computer voices    the Ebert test. If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman  then that's the voice I want. Hi  my name is Marcin    farmer  technologist. I was born in Poland  now in the U.S. I started a group called Open Source Ecology. We've identified the    most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist    things from tractors  bread ovens  circuit makers. Then we set out to create an open source  DIY  do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. We call this the Global Village Construction Set. So let me tell you a story. So I finished my   s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy  and I discovered I was useless. I had no practical skills. The world presented me with options  and I took them. I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming. I bought a tractor    then it broke. I paid to get it repaired    then it broke again. Then pretty soon  I was broke too. I realized that the truly appropriate  low cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. I needed tools that were robust  modular  highly efficient and optimized  low cost  made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime  not designed for obsolescence. I found that I would have to build them myself. So I did just that. And I tested them. And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. So then I published the  D designs  schematics  instructional videos and budgets on a wiki. Then contributors from all over the world began showing up  prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. So far  we have prototyped eight of the    machines. And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. If we can lower the barriers to farming  building  manufacturing  then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. That's not only in the developing world. Our tools are being made for the American farmer  builder  entrepreneur  maker. We've seen lots of excitement from these people  who can now start a construction business  parts manufacturing  organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear  so complete  that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit. I've planted a hundred trees in a day. I've pressed       bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days. From what I've seen  this is only the beginning. If this idea is truly sound  then the implications are significant. A greater distribution of the means of production  environmentally sound supply chains  and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity. We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. Thank you. So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers  Thomas Starzl  who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in       and Sir Roy Calne  who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K. in the following year. I returned to Singapore and  in       performed Asia's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure  but against all odds. Now when I look back  the transplant was actually the easiest part. Next  raising the money to fund the procedure. But perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators    a matter which was debated in the parliament    that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country. But    years on  my patient  Surinder  is Asia's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date. And perhaps more important  I am the proud godmother to her    year old son. But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate. The truth is  there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around. As the demand for donor organs continues to rise  in large part due to the aging population  the supply has remained relatively constant. In the United States alone          men  women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs  and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs. The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation. And the gift of life has been extended from brain dead donors to living  related donors    relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ  like a split liver graft  to a relative or loved one. But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs  the gift of life was then extended from living  related donors to now living  unrelated donors. And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy. How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from  for example  a submissive spouse  an in law  a servant  a slave  an employee  Where and how can we draw the line  In my part of the world  too many people live below the poverty line. And in some areas  the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living  unrelated donors. Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant  I received my next assignment  and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners. I was also pregnant at the time. Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life. But my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts    thoughts of walking through the prison's high security death row  as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room. And at each time  I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me. And for two years  I struggled with the dilemma of waking up at      am on a Friday morning  driving to the prison  getting down  gloved and scrubbed  ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner  remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon. No doubt  I was informed  the consent had been obtained. But  in my life  the one fulfilling skill that I had was now invoking feelings of conflict    conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk. In my team  the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience. Some of us may have been sublimated  but really none of us remained the same. I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos. And in my mind  I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence. It made me wonder if there could be a better way    a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide. Now just about that time  the practice of surgery evolved from big to small  from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures  tiny incisions. And in transplantation  concepts shifted from whole organs to cells. In       at the University of Minnesota  I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants. I witnessed the technical difficulty. And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. I thought to myself  why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas    the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes    and transplant these cells     technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ. And at that time  stem cell research had gained momentum  following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the     s. The observation that stem cells  as master cells  could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types    heart cells  liver cells  pancreatic islet cells    captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public. I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology  and this inspired a shift in my mindset  from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells. And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants. Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells. Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage  chiefly because of their pluripotency    that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types. But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells    the fact that these cells are derived from five day old human embryos    has encouraged research into other types of stem cells. Now to the ridicule of my colleagues  I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non controversial source of stem cells  adipose tissue  or fat  yes fat    nowadays available in abundant supply    you and I  I think  would be very happy to get rid of anyway. Fat derived stem cells are adult stem cells. And adult stem cells are found in you and me    in our blood  in our bone marrow  in our fat  our skin and other organs. And as it turns out  fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells. But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells. And here is the limitation  adult stem cells are mature cells  and  like mature human beings  these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types  as embryonic stem cells  can . But in       two remarkable individuals  Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States  made an astounding discovery. They discovered that adult cells  taken from you and me  could be reprogrammed back into embryonic like cells  which they termed IPS cells  or induced pluripotent stem cells. And so guess what  scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells    aging adult cells from you and me    they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells. And in our lab  we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells    cells that we may use to then form other  more specialized  cells  which one day may be used as cell transplants. If this research is successful  it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos. Indeed  there is a lot of hype  but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions. Heart disease  stroke  diabetes  spinal cord injury  muscular dystrophy  retinal eye diseases    are any of these conditions relevant  personally  to you  In May       something horrible happened to me. I was about to start a robotic operation  but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room  I realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness. Earlier that week  I had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing    yes  I fell. And I started to see floaters and stars  which I casually dismissed as too much high altitude sun exposure. What happened to me might have been catastrophic  if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access. And I had my vision restored  but not before a prolonged period of convalescence    three months    in a head down position. This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients  and especially those with retinal diseases.    million people worldwide are blind  and     million more suffer from impaired vision. Stem cell derived retinal transplants  now in a research phase  may one day restore vision  or part vision  to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide. Indeed  we live in both challenging as well as exciting times. As the world population ages  scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells. It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured  our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation. And these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue. Stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body  or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver. As we speak  there are     or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases. What lies ahead  Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.  .  million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly.  .  million suffer cardiac failure. Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function. There are     clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease. While still in a research phase  stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology. Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings    small  incremental steps  cells rather than organs  repair rather than replacement. Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs. Powerful new technologies always present enigmas. As we speak  the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval. And in the U.K.  neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial. The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers. Each one has his story. My story has been about my journey from organs to cells    a journey through controversy  inspired by hope    hope that  as we age  you and I may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life. Thank you. My students often ask me   What is sociology   And I tell them   It's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don't see.  And they say   So how can I be a sociologist  How can I understand those invisible forces   And I say   Empathy. Start with empathy. It all begins with empathy. Take yourself out of your shoes  put yourself into the shoes of another person.  Here  I'll give you an example. So I imagine my life  if a hundred years ago China had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the United States in search of coal  and they found it  and  in fact  they found lots of it right here. And pretty soon  they began shipping that coal  ton by ton  rail car by rail car  boatload by boatload  back to China and elsewhere around the world. And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so. And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal. And back here in the United States  we saw economic despair  deprivation. This is what I saw. I saw people struggling to get by  not knowing what was what and what was next. And then I asked myself the question. I say   How's it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States  because the coal is such a wealthy resource  it's so much money   And I realized  because the Chinese ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the United States who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves. And the rest of us  the vast majority of us  struggle to get by. And the Chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out against this relationship. Does this sound familiar  And they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal. And everywhere  were symbols of the Chinese    everywhere  a constant reminder. And back in China  what do they say in China  Nothing. They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal. If you ask them  they'll say   Well  you know the coal  we need the coal. I mean  come on  I'm not going to turn down my thermostat. You can't expect that.  And so I get angry  and I get pissed  as do lots of average people. And we fight back  and it gets really ugly. And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way. And before we know it  they send in the tanks and then send in the troops  and lots of people are dying  and it's a very  very difficult situation. Can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes  Can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there or a truck full of soldiers  And just imagine what you would feel. Because you know why they're here  and you know what they're doing here. And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear. If you can  that's empathy    that's empathy. You've left your shoes  and you've stood in mine. And you've got to feel that. Okay  so that's the warm up. That's the warm up. Now we're going to have the real radical experiment. And so for the remainder of my talk  what I want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim living in the Middle East    in particular  in Iraq. And so to help you  perhaps you're a member of this middle class family in Baghdad    and what you want is the best for your kids. You want your kids to have a better life. And you watch the news  you pay attention  you read the newspaper  you go down to the coffee shop with your friends  and you read the newspapers from around the world. And sometimes you even watch satellite  CNN  from the United States. So you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking. But really  you just want a better life for yourself. That's what you want. You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq. You want a better life for yourself. So here  let me help you. Let me help you with some things that you might be thinking. Number one  this incursion into your land these past    years  and before  the reason anyone is interested in your land  and particularly the United States  it's oil. It's all about oil  you know that  everybody knows that. People here back in the United States know it's about oil. It's because somebody else has a design for your resource. It's your resource  it's not somebody else's. It's your land  it's your resource. Somebody else has a design for it. And you know why they have a design  You know why they have their eyes set on it  Because they have an entire economic system that's dependent on that oil    foreign oil  oil from other parts of the world that they don't own. And what else do you think about these people  The Americans  they're rich. Come on  they live in big houses  they have big cars  they all have blond hair  blue eyes  they're happy. You think that. It's not true  of course  but that's the media impression  and that's like what you get. And they have big cities  and the cities are all dependent on oil. And back home  what do you see  Poverty  despair  struggle. Look  you don't live in a wealthy country. This is Iraq. This is what you see. You see people struggling to get by. I mean  it's not easy  you see a lot of poverty. And you feel something about this. These people have designs for your resource  and this is what you see  Something else you see that you talk about    Americans don't talk about this  but you do. There's this thing  this militarization of the world  and it's centered right in the United States. And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending    four percent of the world's population. And you feel it  you see it every day. It's part of your life. And you talk about it with your friends. You read about it. And back when Saddam Hussein was in power  the Americans didn't care about his crimes. When he was gassing the Kurds and gassing Iran  they didn't care about it. When oil was at stake  somehow  suddenly  things mattered. And what you see  something else  the United States  the hub of democracy around the world  they don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world. There are a lot of countries  oil producing countries  that aren't very democratic  but supported by the United States. That's odd. Oh  these incursions  these two wars  the    years of sanctions  the eight years of occupation  the insurgency that's been unleashed on your people  the tens of thousands  the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths  all because of oil. You can't help but think that. You talk about it. It's in the forefront of your mind always. You say   How is that possible   And this man  he's every man    your grandfather  your uncle  your father  your son  your neighbor  your professor  your student. Once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly  pain and sorrow. Everyone in your country has been touched by the violence  the bloodshed  the pain  the horror  everybody. Not a single person in your country has not been touched. But there's something else. There's something else about these people  these Americans who are there. There's something else about them that you see    they don't see themselves. And what do you see  They're Christians. They're Christians. They worship the Christian God  they have crosses  they carry Bibles. Their Bibles have a little insignia that says  U.S. Army  on them. And their leaders  their leaders  before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country    and you know the reason    before they send them off  they go to a Christian church  and they pray to their Christian God  and they ask for protection and guidance from that god. Why  Well  obviously  when people die in the war  they are Muslims  they are Iraqis    they're not Americans. You don't want Americans to die. Protect our troops. And you feel something about that    of course you do. And they do wonderful things. You read about it  you hear about it. They're there to build schools and help people  and that's what they want to do. They do wonderful things  but they also do the bad things  and you can't tell the difference. And this guy  you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin. I mean  here's a guy who says that your God is a false God. Your God's an idol  his God is the true God. The solution to the problem in the Middle East  according to him  is to convert you all to Christianity    just get rid of your religion. And you know that. Americans don't read about this guy. They don't know anything about him  but you do. You pass it around. You pass his words around. I mean this is serious. You're afraid. He was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq. And you're thinking   God  if this guy is saying that  then all the soldiers must be saying that.  And this word here  George Bush called this war a crusade. Man  the Americans  they're just like   Ah  crusade. Whatever. I don't know.  You know what it means. It's a holy war against Muslims. Look  invade  subdue them  take their resources. If they won't submit  kill them. That's what this is about. And you're thinking   My God  these Christians are coming to kill us.  This is frightening. You feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened. And this man  Terry Jones  I mean here's a guy who wants to burn Korans  right  And the Americans   Ah  he's a knucklehead. He's a former hotel manager  he's got three dozen members of his church.  They laugh him off. You don't laugh him off. Because in the context of everything else  all the pieces fit. I mean  of course  this is how Americans take it  so people all over the Middle East  not just in your country  are protesting.  He wants to burn Korans  our holy book. These Christians  who are these Christians  They're so evil  they're so mean    this is what they're about.  This is what you're thinking as an Arab Muslim  as an Iraqi. Of course you're going to think this. And then your cousin says   Hey cuz  check out this website. You've got to see this    Bible Boot Camp. These Christians are nuts. They're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus. And they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say   Sir  yes  sir   and things like grenade toss and weapons care and maintenance. And go to the website. It says  U.S. Army  right on it. I mean  these Christians  they're nuts. How would they do this to their little kids   And you're reading this website. And of course  Christians back in the United States  or anybody  says   Ah  this is some little  tiny church in the middle of nowhere.  You don't know that. For you  this is like all Christians. It's all over the Web  Bible Boot Camp. And look at this  they even teach their kids    they train them in the same way the U.S. Marines train. Isn't that interesting. And it scares you  and it frightens you. So these guys  you see them. You see  I  Sam Richards  I know who these guys are. They're my students  my friends. I know what they're thinking   You don't know.  When you see them  they're something else  they're something else. That's what they are to you. We don't see it that way in the United States  but you see it that way. So here. Of course  you got it wrong. You're generalizing. It's wrong. You don't understand the Americans. It's not a Christian invasion. We're not just there for oil  we're there for lots of reasons. You have it wrong. You've missed it. And of course  most of you don't support the insurgency  you don't support killing Americans  you don't support the terrorists. Of course you don't. Very few people do. But some of you do. And this is a perspective. Okay  so now  here's what we're going to do. Step outside of your shoes that you're in right now and step back into your normal shoes. So everyone's back in the room  okay. Now here comes the radical experiment. So we're all back home. This photo  this woman  man  I feel her. I feel her. She's my sister  my wife  my cousin  my neighbor. She's anybody to me. These guys standing there  everybody in the photo  I feel this photo  man. So here's what I want you to do. Let's go back to my first example of the Chinese. So I want you to go there. So it's all about coal  and the Chinese are here in the United States. And what I want you to do is picture her as a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag because her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising. And the soldiers are Chinese  and everybody else is Chinese. As an American  how do you feel about this picture  What do you think about that scene  Okay  try this. Bring it back. This is the scene here. It's an American  American soldiers  American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East    in Iraq or Afghanistan. Now  put yourself in the shoes  go back to the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq. What are you feeling and thinking about this photo  about this woman  Okay  now follow me on this  because I'm taking a big risk here. And so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me. These gentlemen here  they're insurgents. They were caught by the American soldiers  trying to kill Americans. And maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded. Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them. Can you feel the rage  Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks  Can you go there  It shouldn't be that difficult. You just    oh  man. Now  put yourself in their shoes. Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders  Which one  Can you feel their anger  their fear  their rage at what has happened in their country  Can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning bent down to their child and hugged their child and said   Dear  I'll be back later. I'm going out to defend your freedom  your lives. I'm going out to look out for us  the future of our country.  Can you imagine that  Can you imagine saying that  Can you go there  What do you think they're feeling  You see  that's empathy. It's also understanding. Now  you might ask   Okay  Sam  so why do you do this sort of thing  Why would you use this example of all examples   And I say  because ... because. You're allowed to hate these people. You're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being. And if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch  one tiny inch  then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life. You can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person's driving    miles per hour in the passing lane  or your teenage son  or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings. Whatever it is  you can go so far. And this is what I tell my students  step outside of your tiny  little world. Step inside of the tiny  little world of somebody else. And then do it again and do it again and do it again. And suddenly all these tiny  little worlds  they come together in this complex web. And they build a big  complex world. And suddenly  without realizing it  you're seeing the world differently. Everything has changed. Everything in your life has changed. And that's  of course  what this is about. Attend to other lives  other visions. Listen to other people  enlighten ourselves. I'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq  but as a sociologist  what I am saying is I understand. And now perhaps    perhaps    you do too. Thank you. So it's       I'm in college  and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence  Rhode Island to Portland  Oregon. And you know  we're young and unemployed  so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests    basically the longest route we can possibly take. And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota  I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for       miles.  What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road   My friend looks at me totally blankly. There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look. And I'm like   You know  all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them.  She just stares at me for a few moments  and then she cracks up  because she figures out what I'm talking about. And what I'm talking about is this. Right  the famous Chinese character for picnic area. I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this    why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us  and how we behave when that happens  and what all of this can tell us about human nature. In other words  as you heard Chris say  I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong. This might strike you as a strange career move  but it actually has one great advantage  no job competition. In fact  most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong  or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong. We get it in the abstract. We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes. The human species  in general  is fallible    okay fine. But when it comes down to me  right now  to all the beliefs I hold  here in the present tense  suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window    and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about. And the thing is  the present tense is where we live. We go to meetings in the present tense  we go on family vacations in the present tense  we go to the polls and vote in the present tense. So effectively  we all kind of wind up traveling through life  trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything. I think this is a problem. I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals  in our personal and professional lives  and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture. So what I want to do today is  first of all  talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right. And second  why it's such a problem. And finally  I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so  it is the single greatest moral  intellectual and creative leap you can make. So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right  One reason  actually  has to do with a feeling of being wrong. So let me ask you guys something    or actually  let me ask you guys something  because you're right here  How does it feel    emotionally    how does it feel to be wrong  Dreadful. Thumbs down. Embarrassing. Okay  wonderful  great. Dreadful  thumbs down  embarrassing    thank you  these are great answers  but they're answers to a different question. You guys are answering the question  How does it feel to realize you're wrong  Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things  right  I mean it can be devastating  it can be revelatory  it can actually be quite funny  like my stupid Chinese character mistake. But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything. I'll give you an analogy. Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner  In pretty much every episode of this cartoon  there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff  which is fine    he's a bird  he can fly. But the thing is  the coyote runs off the cliff right after him. And what's funny    at least if you're six years old    is that the coyote's totally fine too. He just keeps running    right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid air. That's when he falls. When we're wrong about something    not when we realize it  but before that    we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down. You know  we're already wrong  we're already in trouble  but we feel like we're on solid ground. So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago. It does feel like something to be wrong  it feels like being right. So this is one reason  a structural reason  why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness. I call this error blindness. Most of the time  we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something  until it's too late. But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well    and this one is cultural. Think back for a moment to elementary school. You're sitting there in class  and your teacher is handing back quiz papers  and one of them looks like this. This is not mine  by the way. So there you are in grade school  and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper. It's the dumb kid  the troublemaker  the one who never does his homework. So by the time you are nine years old  you've already learned  first of all  that people who get stuff wrong are lazy  irresponsible dimwits    and second of all  that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes. We learn these really bad lessons really well. And a lot of us    and I suspect  especially a lot of us in this room    deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students  perfectionists  over achievers. Right  Mr. CFO  astrophysicist  ultra marathoner  You're all CFO  astrophysicists  ultra marathoners  it turns out. Okay  so fine. Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong. Because according to this  getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us. So we just insist that we're right  because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe. So let me tell you a story. A couple of years ago  a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery. Beth Israel's in Boston. It's the teaching hospital for Harvard    one of the best hospitals in the country. So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room. She's anesthetized  the surgeon does his thing    stitches her back up  sends her out to the recovery room. Everything seems to have gone fine. And she wakes up  and she looks down at herself  and she says   Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages   Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one. When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident  he said something very interesting. He said   For whatever reason  the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient.  The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous. This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world. And when we act like it is  and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong  well that's when we end up doing things like dumping     million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico  or torpedoing the global economy. So this is a huge practical problem. But it's also a huge social problem. Think for a moment about what it means to feel right. It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality. And when you feel that way  you've got a problem to solve  which is  how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you  It turns out  most of us explain those people the same way  by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions. The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant. They don't have access to the same information that we do  and when we generously share that information with them  they're going to see the light and come on over to our team. When that doesn't work  when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us  then we move on to a second assumption  which is that they're idiots. They have all the right pieces of the puzzle  and they are too moronic to put them together correctly. And when that doesn't work  when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart  then we move on to a third assumption  they know the truth  and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. So this is a catastrophe. This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly. But to me  what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human. It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds. And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing. That is not true  and if it were  life would be incredibly boring. The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is. It's that you can see the world as it isn't. We can remember the past  and we can think about the future  and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place. And we all do this a little differently  which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this. And yeah  it is also why we get things wrong.       years before Descartes said his famous thing about  I think therefore I am   this guy  St. Augustine  sat down and wrote  Fallor ergo sum      I err therefore I am.  Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up  it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system  something we can eradicate or overcome. It's totally fundamental to who we are. Because  unlike God  we don't really know what's going on out there. And unlike all of the other animals  we are obsessed with trying to figure it out. To me  this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity. Last year  for various reasons  I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life. And so I'm listening and I'm listening  and at some point  I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong. And my first thought was   I've lost it. I've become the crazy wrongness lady. I just imagined it everywhere   which has happened. But a couple of months later  I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass  who's the host of the show. And I mentioned this to him  and he was like   No actually  that's true. In fact   he says   as a staff  we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto theme. And the crypto theme is  'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is   says Ira Glass   we need this. We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work.  And for the rest of us  audience members  as listeners  as readers  we eat this stuff up. We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings. When it comes to our stories  we love being wrong. But  you know  our stories are like this because our lives are like this. We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead. George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq  find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction  liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East. And something else happened instead. And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life  until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son. And something else happened instead. And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together. And something else happened instead. And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize. And something else happened instead. I mean  this is life. For good and for ill  we generate these incredible stories about the world around us  and then the world turns around and astonishes us. No offense  but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong. We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements  but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements  Because half the stuff that's the most mind boggling and world altering    TED         eh. Didn't really work out that way  did it  Where's my jet pack  Chris  So here we are again. And that's how it goes. We come up with another idea. We tell another story. We hold another conference. The theme of this one  as you guys have now heard seven million times  is the rediscovery of wonder. And to me  if you really want to rediscover wonder  you need to step outside of that tiny  terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say   Wow  I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.  Thank you. Thank you guys. I'm very fortunate to be here. I feel so fortunate. I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me. I called my wife Leslie  and I said   You know  there's so many good people trying to do so much good. It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels.  It's a true feeling. But let me get to the talk    I see the clock is running. I'm a public school teacher  and I just want to share a story of my superintendent. Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County  Virginia  the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. And she's a very high tech superintendent. She uses smart boards  she blogs  she Tweets  she does Facebook  she does all this sort of high tech stuff. She's a technology leader and instructional leader. But in her office  there's this old wooden  weather worn table  kitchen table    peeling green paint  it's kind of rickety. And I said   Pam  you're such a modern  cutting edge person. Why is this old table in your office   And she told me  she said   You know  I grew up in Southwestern Virginia  in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia  and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen. And we'd come in from playing  he'd come in from plowing and working  and we'd sit around that table every night. And as I grew up  I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table  I began to call it the wisdom table. And when he passed on  I took this table with me and brought it to my office  and it reminds me of him. It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes.  The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game  and essentially it is also an empty space. And I'd like to think of it as a   st century wisdom table  really. It all started back in     . I was a young man  and I had been dropping in and out of college. And my parents were very patient  but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest. And I remember the last time I came back from India    in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses    and I said to my father   Dad  I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment.  He said   Well there's one more thing you need to find.  I said   What is that  dad    A job.  And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something. So I got a degree and it turned out to be education. It was an experimental education program. It could have been dentistry  but the word  experimental  was in it  and so that's what I had to go for. And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia  the capital city  bought a three piece suit    my concession to convention    kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes    at the time it was the '  s    and I walked in  and I sat down and had an interview. And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor  her name was Anna Aro  said I had the job teaching gifted children. And I was so shocked  so stunned  I got up and said   Well  thank you  but what do I do   Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much. There weren't really many materials or things to use. And I said   What do I do   And her answer shocked me. It stunned me. Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that. She said   What do you want to do   And that question cleared the space. There was no program directive  no manual to follow  no standards in gifted education in that way. And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students  an empty space  whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding. So this happened in       and I was teaching many years later  and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker. His name is Chris Farina. Chris Farina is here today at his own cost. Chris  could you stand up and let them see you    a young  visionary filmmaker who's made a film. This film is called  World Peace and Other  th Grade Achievements.  He proposed the film to me    it's a great title. He proposed the film to me  and I said   Yeah  maybe it'll be on local TV  and we can say hi to our friends.  But the film has really gone places. Now it's still in debt  but Chris has managed  through his own sacrifice  to get this film out. So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me  more than a story about one teacher. It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers. And it's a beautiful thing. And the strange thing is  when I watch the film    I have the eerie sensation of seeing it    I saw myself literally disappear. What I saw was my teachers coming through me. I saw my geometry teacher in high school  Mr. Rucell's wry smile under his handlebar mustache. That's the smile I use    that's his smile. I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes. And they weren't flashing in anger  they were flashing in love  intense love for her students. And I have that kind of flash sometimes. And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high heels to elementary school every day. And you know  she had that old school teacher stare. You know the one.  And I'm not even talking about you behind me  because I've got eyes in the back of my head.  You know that teacher  I didn't use that stare very often  but I do have it in my repertoire. And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me. And then I saw my own parents  my first teachers. My father  very inventive  spatial thinker. That's my brother Malcolm there on the right. And my mother  who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia  who was my inspiration. And really  I feel as though  when I see the film    I have a gesture she does  like this    I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture. I am one of her teaching gestures. And the beautiful thing was  I got to teach my daughter in elementary school  Madeline. And so that gesture of my mother's continues through many generations. It's an amazing feeling to have that lineage. And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people. I'm not here alone. There are many people on this stage right now. And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about. It started out like this  it's just a four foot by five foot plywood board in an inner city urban school      . I was creating a lesson for students on Africa. We put all the problems of the world there  and I thought  let's let them solve it. I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading. I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies. So I thought  well they like to play games. I'll make something    I didn't say interactive  we didn't have that term in         but something interactive. And so we made the game  and it has since evolved to a four foot by four foot by four foot Plexiglass structure. And it has four Plexiglass layers. There's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining. There's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces  a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it    even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining. There are four countries around the board. The kids make up the names of the countries    some are rich  some are poor. They have different assets  commercial and military. And each country has a cabinet. There's a Prime Minister  Secretary of State  Minister of Defense and a CFO  or Comptroller. I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them. I offer them the job  they can turn it down  and then they choose their own cabinet. There's a World Bank  arms dealers and a United Nations. There's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather. That's not all. And then there's a    page crisis document with    interlocking problems. So that  if one thing changes  everything else changes. I throw them into this complex matrix  and they trust me because we have a deep  rich relationship together. And so with all these crises  we have    let's see    ethnic and minority tensions  we have chemical and nuclear spills  nuclear proliferation. There's oil spills  environmental disasters  water rights disputes  breakaway republics  famine  endangered species and global warming. If Al Gore is here  I'm going to send my fourth graders from Agnor Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week. And they've done it several times too. So I also have in the game a saboteur    some child    it's basically a troublemaker    and I have my troublemaker put to use because they  on the surface  are trying to save the world and their position in the game. But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game. And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies  trying to cause everyone to think more deeply. The saboteur is there  and we also read from Sun Tzu's  The Art of War.  Fourth graders understand it    nine years old    and they handle that and use that to understand how to  not follow    at first they do    the paths to power and destruction  the path to war. They learn to overlook short sighted reactions and impulsive thinking  to think in a long term  more consequential way. Stewart Brand is here  and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force. And in the game  sometimes students actually form a peace force. I'm just a clock watcher. I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator. The students run the game. I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing. So I'll just share with you ... You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world. See  Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot  and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem. John Hunter  I offered them a    Actually  I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer. And I admit the truth to them right up front  I don't know. And because I don't know  they've got to dig up the answer. And so I apologize to them as well. I say   I'm so sorry  boys and girls  but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape  and we hope you can fix it for us  and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it.  It's a sincere apology  and they take it very seriously. Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like. Well when we have the game start  here's what you see. JH  My question to you is  who's in charge of that classroom  It's a serious question  who is really in charge  I've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time. There's a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don't have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher  control every conversation and response in the classroom. It's impossible. Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine  and I admit it to them openly. So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened. In this game we had a little girl  and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation. And the Defense Minister    she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth. And she was next door to a very wealthy  oil rich neighbor. Without provocation  suddenly she attacked  against her Prime Minister's orders  the next door neighbor's oil fields. She marched into the oil field reserves  surrounded it  without firing a shot  and secured it and held it. And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up. We were all upset with her   Why are you doing this  This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you   This was a little girl and  at nine years old  she held her pieces and said   I know what I'm doing.  To her girlfriends she said that. That's a breach there. And we learned in this  you don't really ever want to cross a nine year old girl with tanks. They are the toughest opponents. And we were very upset. I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this  But come to find out  a few game days later    and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team    actually there's a negotiation period with all teams  and each team takes a turn  then we go back in negotiation  around and around  so each turn around is one game day. So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world. Had they had their fuel supplies  they would have done it. She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game. Now she used a small war to avert a larger war  so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right  conditional good  or not right. That's the kind of thinking that we put them in  the situations. I could not have designed that in teaching it. It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom. Another example  a beautiful thing happened. We have a letter in the game. If you're a military commander and you wage troops    the little plastic toys on the board    and you lose them  I put in a letter. You have to write a letter to their parents    the fictional parents of your fictional troops    explaining what happened and offering your condolences. So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat. And so we had this situation come up    last summer actually  at Agnor Hurt School in Albemarle County    and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said   Mr. Hunter  let's ask    there's a parent over there.  There was a parent visiting that day  just sitting in the back of the room.  Let's ask that mom to read the letter. It'll be more realer if she reads it.  So we did  we asked her  and she gamely picked up the letter.  Sure.  She started reading. She read one sentence. She read two sentences. By the third sentence  she was in tears. I was in tears. Everybody understood that when we lose somebody  the winners are not gloating. We all lose. And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding. I'll show you what my friend David says about this. He's been in many battles. I mean  we've been lucky  most of  the time. But now I'm feeling really weird because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week. One week he said   Those who go into battle and win will want to go back  and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win.  And so I've been winning battles  so I'm going into battles  more battles. And I think it's sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said. JH  I get chills every time I see that. That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen. And I can't design that  I can't plan that  and I can't even test that. But it's self evident assessment. We know that's an authentic assessment of learning. We have a lot of data  but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on. So I'll just share a third story. This is about my friend Brennan. We had played the game one session after school for many weeks  about seven weeks  and we had essentially solved all    of the interlocking crises. The way the game is won is all    problems have to be solved and every country's asset value has to be increased above its starting point. Some are poor  some are wealthy. There are billions. The World Bank president was a third grader one time. He says   How many zeros in a trillion  I've got to calculate that right away.  But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him. So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer. There was no way they could win. And we were approaching four o'clock  our cut off time    there was about a minute left    and despair just settled over the room. I thought  I'm failing as a teacher. I should have gotten it so they could have won. They shouldn't be failing like this. I've failed them. And I was just feeling so sad and dejected. And suddenly  Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell  the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets  and he ran back to his seat  rang the bell. Everybody ran to his chair  there was screaming  there was yelling  waving of their dossiers. They get these dossiers full of secret documents. They were gesticulating  they were running around. I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom. Principal walks in  I'm out of a job. The parents were looking in the window. And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat. He rings the bell again. He says   We have     and there's    seconds left on the clock     we have  all nations  pooled all our funds together. And we've got     billion dollars. We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country. And if they accept it  it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game. Will you accept it   And there are three seconds left on the clock. Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country  and he says   Yes.  And the game is won. Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for  that was unexpected and unpredictable. Every game we play is different. Some games are more about social issues  some are more about economic issues. Some games are more about warfare. But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human. I allow them to go there and  through their own experience  learn  in a bloodless way  how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing. And they find out what is right their own way  their own selves. And so in this game  I've learned so much from it  but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world  they may save us all. If only. And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I'm standing  thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon  which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it. My own interest in this subject  and my passion for it  began rather accidentally. I had bought a copy of this book   The Universe and Dr. Einstein     a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle. A few years after that  in Bangalore  I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night  and I picked up this book  thinking it would put me to sleep in    minutes. And as it happened  I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot. And I was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do. And that feeling hasn't left me yet. That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career    from being a software engineer to become a science writer    so that I could partake in the joy of science  and also the joy of communicating it to others. And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts  to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes  detectors  instruments that people are building  or have built  in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail. So it took me from places like Chile    the Atacama Desert in Chile    to Siberia  to underground mines in the Japanese Alps  in Northern America  all the way to Antarctica and even to the South Pole. And today I would like to share with you some images  some stories of these trips. I have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting  literally at times  their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe. And I first begin with a pie chart    and I promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation    but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos. All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter    the stuff that we're all made of    and that's four percent of the universe. Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe  which makes up    percent of the universe  and something called dark energy  which permeates the fabric of space time  that makes up another    percent. So if you look at this pie chart     percent of the universe  at this point in our exploration of it  is unknown or not well understood. And most of the experiments  telescopes that I went to see are in some way addressing this question  these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter. And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors. And the reason why they have to go underground is that  if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth  the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays  ambient radio activity  even our own bodies. You might not believe it  but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment. So they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector. And I went to see one of these experiments  and this is actually    you can barely see it  and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there    this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in     . And physicists came and started using it sometime in the     s. And the miners in the early part of the last century worked  literally  in candlelight. And today  you would see this inside the mine  half a mile underground. This is one of the largest underground labs in the world. And  among other things  they're looking for dark matter. There is another way to search for dark matter  which is indirectly. If dark matter exists in our universe  in our galaxy  then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about    one of them being neutrinos. And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules. When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light  a flash of blue light  and by looking for this blue light  you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then  indirectly  something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino. But you need very  very large volumes of water in order to do this. You need something like tens of megatons of water    almost a gigaton of water    in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino. And where in the world would you find such water  Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard. This is Lake Baikal. It is the largest lake in the world. It's     km long. It's about    to    km wide in most places  and one to two kilometers deep. And what the Russians are doing is they're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light. And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there. This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter. The lake is entirely frozen. And the line of black dots that you see in the background  that's the ice camp where the physicists are working. The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring  which  if they did that  they would need ships and submersibles to do their work. So they wait until winter    the lake is completely frozen over    and they use this meter thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work. So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter. They have to drill holes in the ice  dive down into the water    cold  cold water    to get hold of the instrument  bring it up  do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do  put it back and get out before the ice melts. Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it's full of cracks. And you have to imagine  there's an entire sea like lake underneath  moving. I still don't understand this one Russian man working in his bare chest  but that tells you how hard he was working. And these people  a handful of people  have been working for    years  looking for particles that may or may not exist. And they have dedicated their lives to it. And just to give you an idea  they have spent    million over    years. It's very harsh conditions. They work on a shoestring budget. The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack. And it's that basic  but they do this every year. From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile  to see something called The Very Large Telescope. The Very Large Telescope is one of these things that astronomers do    they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively. I can tell you for a fact  that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope. And you wouldn't believe it  but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. But nonetheless  it's an extraordinary piece of engineering. These are four  .  meter telescopes. And these telescopes  among other things  they're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time. And the more you understand that  the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about. And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror. Each mirror  there are four of them  is made of a single piece of glass  a monolithic piece of high tech ceramic  that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is  to  imagine a city like Paris  with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower  if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy  you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high. And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured. An extraordinary set of telescopes. Here's another view of the same. The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert. The dry air is really good for telescopes  and also  the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about     days of clear skies. Finally  I want to take you to Antarctica. I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world. This is cosmology's final frontier. Some of the most amazing experiments  some of the most extreme experiments  are being done in Antarctica. I was there to view something called a long duration balloon flight  which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere  the upper stratosphere     km up. And that's where they do their experiments  and then the balloon  the payload  is brought down. So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. That's an American C    cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to McMurdo in Antarctica. And here we are about to board our bus. And I don't know if you can read the lettering  but it says   Ivan the Terribus.  And that's taking us to McMurdo. And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo. And you barely might be able to make out this hut here. This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole. Because it's so cold  the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it  with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there. It's an extraordinary place. This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer  and about     in winter when it's completely dark for six months. I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument. This is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper stratosphere to an altitude of    km. What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight. So you're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of    km. And the engineers  the technicians  the physicists have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf  because Antarctica    I won't go into the reasons why    but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches  except for the weather. The weather  as you can imagine  this is summer  and you're standing on     ft of ice. And there's a volcano behind  which has glaciers at the very top. And what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon    the fabric  parachute and everything    on the ice and then fill it up with helium. And that process takes about two hours. And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly. For instance  here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind  which is eventually going to be filled up with helium. Those two trucks you see at the very end carry    tanks each of compressed helium. Now  in case the weather changes before the launch  they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station. And this particular balloon  because it has to launch two tons of weight  is an extremely huge balloon. The fabric alone weighs two tons. In order to minimize the weight  it's very thin  it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper. And if they have to pack it back  they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again    except  when they did it first  it would have been done in Texas. Here  they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing  so they have to take their shoes off  get barefoot into the boxes  in this cold  and do that kind of work. That's the kind of dedication these people have. Here's the balloon being filled up with helium  and you can see it's a gorgeous sight. Here's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end to end. So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left hand side  and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute  and then the parachute is then connected to the payload. And remember  all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold  in sub zero temperatures. They're wearing about    kg of clothing and stuff  but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that. And I would like to share with you a launch. release the balloon  release the balloon. Anil Ananthaswamy  And I'll finally like to leave you with two images. This is an observatory in the Himalayas  in Ladakh in India. And the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right hand side. And on the far left there is a     year old Buddhist monastery. This is a close up of the Buddhist monastery. And I was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has. One is exploring the cosmos on the outside  and the other one is exploring our interior being. And both require silence of some sort. And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes  the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence  whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever. And it was very obvious that  if we destroy these silent places on Earth  we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards  because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space. Thank you. Imagine a big explosion as you climb through       ft. Imagine a plane full of smoke. Imagine an engine going clack  clack  clack. It sounds scary. Well  I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in  D. I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants. So I looked at them right away  and they said   No problem. We probably hit some birds.  The pilot had already turned the plane around  and we weren't that far. You could see Manhattan. Two minutes later  three things happened at the same time. The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River. That's usually not the route. He turns off the engines. Now  imagine being in a plane with no sound. And then he says three words. The most unemotional three words I've ever heard. He says   Brace for impact.  I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. I could see in her eyes  it was terror. Life was over. Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day. I learned that it all changes in an instant. We have this bucket list  we have these things we want to do in life  and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't  all the fences I wanted to mend  all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did. As I thought about that later on  I came up with a saying  which is   I collect bad wines.  Because if the wine is ready and the person is there  I'm opening it. I no longer want to postpone anything in life. And that urgency  that purpose  has really changed my life. The second thing I learned that day    and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge  which was by not a lot    I thought about  wow  I really feel one real regret. I've lived a good life. In my own humanity and mistakes  I've tried to get better at everything I tried. But in my humanity  I also allow my ego to get in. And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter. And I thought about my relationship with my wife  with my friends  with people. And after  as I reflected on that  I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. It's not perfect  but it's a lot better. I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. It feels great. I no longer try to be right  I choose to be happy. The third thing I learned    and this is as your mental clock starts going             .  You can see the water coming. I'm saying   Please blow up.  I don't want this thing to break in    pieces like you've seen in those documentaries. And as we're coming down  I had a sense of  wow  dying is not scary. It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives. But it was very sad. I didn't want to go  I love my life. And that sadness really framed in one thought  which is  I only wish for one thing. I only wish I could see my kids grow up. About a month later  I was at a performance by my daughter    first grader  not much artistic talent    Yet  And I'm bawling  I'm crying  like a little kid. And it made all the sense in the world to me. I realized at that point  by connecting those two dots  that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad. Above all  above all  the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad. I was given the gift of a miracle  of not dying that day. I was given another gift  which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently. I challenge you guys that are flying today  imagine the same thing happens on your plane    and please don't    but imagine  and how would you change  What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever  How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them  And more than anything  are you being the best parent you can  Thank you. How would you like to be better than you are  Suppose I said that  with just a few changes in your genes  you could get a better memory    more precise  more accurate and quicker. Or maybe you'd like to be more fit  stronger  with more stamina. Would you like to be more attractive and self confident  How about living longer with good health  Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity. Which one would you like the most  Which would you like  if you could have just one  Creativity. How many people would choose creativity  Raise your hands. Let me see. A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here. How many would opt for memory  Quite a few more. How about fitness  A few less. What about longevity  Ah  the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor. If you could have any one of these  it would be a very different world. Is it just imaginary  Or  is it  perhaps  possible  Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference  but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject. The great   th century geneticist  T.G. Dobzhansky  who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church  once wrote an essay that he titled  Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution.  Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution  this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid  take out your personal communications device    I give you permission    and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong  because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. But if you do accept biological evolution  consider this  is it just about the past  or is it about the future  Does it apply to others  or does it apply to us  This is another look at the tree of life. In this picture  I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions  because if you look at the edges of the tree of life  every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms  it has survived  it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment. The human part of this branch  way out on one end  is  of course  the one that we are most interested in. We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago. In the interval  there have been perhaps    or    different species of hominids. Some have come and gone. We have been here for about         years. It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life  but actually  for the most part  the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same. Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics  This is not like human insulin  this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas. And speaking of bacteria  do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body  Maybe    times more. I mean think of it  when Antonio Damasio asks about your self image  do you think about the bacteria  Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria. It's warm  it's dark  it's moist  it's very cozy. And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part. It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria  with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit. But otherwise  you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria  just as they are essential to your life. They help in the digestion of essential nutrients  and they protect you against certain diseases. But what will come in the future  Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species  Or  are we destined to become something different    something  perhaps  even better adapted to the environment  Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang     billion years ago    the Earth  the solar system  about four and a half billion years    the first signs of proto life  maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth    the first multi celled organisms  perhaps as much as     or a billion years ago    and then the human species  finally emerging in the last         years. In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe  life on Earth is like a brief measure  the animal kingdom  like a single measure  and human life  a small grace note. That was us. That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk  so I hope you enjoyed it. Now when I was a freshman in college  I took my first biology class. I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology. I became enamored of the power of evolution  and I realized something very fundamental  in most of the existence of life in single celled organisms  each cell simply divides  and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. But at the time multi celled organisms come online  things start to change. Sexual reproduction enters the picture. And very importantly  with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome  the rest of the body becomes expendable. In fact  you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction. Now I have to confess  when I was a college undergraduate  I thought  okay  sex death  sex death  death for sex    it seemed pretty reasonable at the time  but with each passing year  I've come to have increasing doubts. I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns  who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his   s. And one night  there's a knock at his hotel room door. He answers the door. Standing before him is a gorgeous  scantily clad showgirl. She looks at him and says   I'm here for super sex.   That's fine   says George   I'll take the soup.  I came to realize  as a physician  that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution    not necessarily contradictory  just different. I was trying to preserve the body. I wanted to keep us healthy. I wanted to restore health from disease. I wanted us to live long and healthy lives. Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation  adapting and surviving through generation after generation. From an evolutionary point of view  you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea. I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said   I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying.  Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest lived. It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest  and not even the smartest. Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. That is the sole test of survival and success. At the bottom of the ocean  bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce  if fish were there  sous vide cooked fish  nevertheless  have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them. So what does this mean  as we look back at what has happened in evolution  and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution  and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase  I would say that there are a number of possibilities. The first is that we will not evolve. We have reached a kind of equipoise. And the reasoning behind that would be  first  we have  through medicine  managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population. And secondly  we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it. And by the way  we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place. A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind  natural  imposed by the forces of nature. And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly  but they are inexorable. And as far as isolation goes  when we as a species do colonize distant planets  there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way. But there's a third possibility  an enticing  intriguing and frightening possibility. I call it neo evolution    the new evolution that is not simply natural  but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make. Now how could this come about  How could it be possible that we would do this  Consider  first  the reality that people today  in some cultures  are making choices about their offspring. They're  in some cultures  choosing to have more males than females. It's not necessarily good for the society  but it's what the individual and the family are choosing. Think also  if it were possible ever for you to choose  not simply to choose the sex of your child  but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases. What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke  Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes  If we look ahead  these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible. The Human Genome Project started in       and it took    years. It cost  .  billion dollars. The year after it was finished in       you could do the same job for    million dollars in three to four months. Today  you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about        dollars and in the space of about a week. It won't be very long before the reality will be the       dollar human genome  and it will be increasingly available for everyone. Just a week ago  the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer  two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way    what Frances Arnold calls  directed evolution.  A couple of years ago  the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell  a fibroblast  and by manipulating just four genes  he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell    a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body. These changes are coming. The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves  but induce immunity against other viruses. Believe it or not  there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant. Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco  These are all reality today  and  in  the future  will be evermore possible. Imagine then just two other little changes. You can change the cells in your body  but what if you could change the cells in your offspring  What if you could change the sperm and the ova  or change the newly fertilized egg  and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life    eliminate the diabetes  eliminate the hemophilia  reduce the risk of cancer  Who doesn't want healthier children  And then  that same analytic technology  that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease  will also enable us to adopt super attributes  hyper capacities    that better memory. Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings  especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine  Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer  Why not live longer  These will be irresistible. And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation  and we can adopt the attributes we want  we will have converted old style evolution into neo evolution. We'll take a process that normally might require         years  and we can compress it down to a thousand years    and maybe even in the next     years. These are choices that your grandchildren  or their grandchildren  are going to have before them. Will we use these choices to make a society that is better  that is more successful  that is kinder  Or  will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us  Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform  or more robust and more versatile  These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face. And most profoundly of all  will we ever be able to develop the wisdom  and to inherit the wisdom  that we'll need to make these choices wisely  For better or worse  and sooner than you may think  these choices will be up to us. Thank you. So security is two different things  it's a feeling  and it's a reality. And they're different. You could feel secure even if you're not. And you can be secure even if you don't feel it. Really  we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word. And what I want to do in this talk is to split them apart    figuring out when they diverge and how they converge. And language is actually a problem here. There aren't a lot of good words for the concepts we're going to talk about. So if you look at security from economic terms  it's a trade off. Every time you get some security  you're always trading off something. Whether this is a personal decision    whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home    or a national decision    where you're going to invade some foreign country    you're going to trade off something  either money or time  convenience  capabilities  maybe fundamental liberties. And the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer  but whether it's worth the trade off. You've heard in the past several years  the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is not in power. That might be true  but it's not terribly relevant. The question is  was it worth it  And you can make your own decision  and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it. That's how you think about security    in terms of the trade off. Now there's often no right or wrong here. Some of us have a burglar alarm system at home  and some of us don't. And it'll depend on where we live  whether we live alone or have a family  how much cool stuff we have  how much we're willing to accept the risk of theft. In politics also  there are different opinions. A lot of times  these trade offs are about more than just security  and I think that's really important. Now people have a natural intuition about these trade offs. We make them every day    last night in my hotel room  when I decided to double lock the door  or you in your car when you drove here  when we go eat lunch and decide the food's not poison and we'll eat it. We make these trade offs again and again  multiple times a day. We often won't even notice them. They're just part of being alive  we all do it. Every species does it. Imagine a rabbit in a field  eating grass  and the rabbit's going to see a fox. That rabbit will make a security trade off   Should I stay  or should I flee   And if you think about it  the rabbits that are good at making that trade off will tend to live and reproduce  and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve. So you'd think that us  as a successful species on the planet    you  me  everybody    would be really good at making these trade offs. Yet it seems  again and again  that we're hopelessly bad at it. And I think that's a fundamentally interesting question. I'll give you the short answer. The answer is  we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality. Now most of the time  that works. Most of the time  feeling and reality are the same. Certainly that's true for most of human prehistory. We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense. One way to think of it is that we're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the East African highlands in         B.C.      New York  not so much. Now there are several biases in risk perception. A lot of good experiments in this. And you can see certain biases that come up again and again. So I'll give you four. We tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks    so flying versus driving. The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar. One example would be  people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common. This is for children. Third  personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks    so Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name. And the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don't control. So once you take up skydiving or smoking  you downplay the risks. If a risk is thrust upon you    terrorism was a good example    you'll overplay it because you don't feel like it's in your control. There are a bunch of other of these biases  these cognitive biases  that affect our risk decisions. There's the availability heuristic  which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind. So you can imagine how that works. If you hear a lot about tiger attacks  there must be a lot of tigers around. You don't hear about lion attacks  there aren't a lot of lions around. This works until you invent newspapers. Because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks. I tell people  if it's in the news  don't worry about it. Because by definition  news is something that almost never happens. When something is so common  it's no longer news    car crashes  domestic violence    those are the risks you worry about. We're also a species of storytellers. We respond to stories more than data. And there's some basic innumeracy going on. I mean  the joke  One  Two  Three  Many  is kind of right. We're really good at small numbers. One mango  two mangoes  three mangoes         mangoes          mangoes    it's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot. So one half  one quarter  one fifth    we're good at that. One in a million  one in a billion    they're both almost never. So we have trouble with the risks that aren't very common. And what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality. And the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack  they get different. Now you either have a feeling    you feel more secure than you are. There's a false sense of security. Or the other way  and that's a false sense of insecurity. I write a lot about  security theater   which are products that make people feel secure  but don't actually do anything. There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure  but doesn't make us feel secure. Maybe it's what the CIA's supposed to do for us. So back to economics. If economics  if the market  drives security  and if people make trade offs based on the feeling of security  then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure. And there are two ways to do this. One  you can make people actually secure and hope they notice. Or two  you can make people just feel secure and hope they don't notice. So what makes people notice  Well a couple of things  understanding of the security  of the risks  the threats  the countermeasures  how they work. But if you know stuff  you're more likely to have your feelings match reality. Enough real world examples helps. Now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood  because we live there  and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality. Security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly. Okay  so what makes people not notice  Well  a poor understanding. If you don't understand the risks  you don't understand the costs  you're likely to get the trade off wrong  and your feeling doesn't match reality. Not enough examples. There's an inherent problem with low probability events. If  for example  terrorism almost never happens  it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter terrorist measures. This is why you keep sacrificing virgins  and why your unicorn defenses are working just great. There aren't enough examples of failures. Also  feelings that are clouding the issues    the cognitive biases I talked about earlier  fears  folk beliefs  basically an inadequate model of reality. So let me complicate things. I have feeling and reality. I want to add a third element. I want to add model. Feeling and model in our head  reality is the outside world. It doesn't change  it's real. So feeling is based on our intuition. Model is based on reason. That's basically the difference. In a primitive and simple world  there's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality. You don't need a model. But in a modern and complex world  you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face. There's no feeling about germs. You need a model to understand them. So this model is an intelligent representation of reality. It's  of course  limited by science  by technology. We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them. It's limited by our cognitive biases. But it has the ability to override our feelings. Where do we get these models  We get them from others. We get them from religion  from culture  teachers  elders. A couple years ago  I was in South Africa on safari. The tracker I was with grew up in Kruger National Park. He had some very complex models of how to survive. And it depended on if you were attacked by a lion or a leopard or a rhino or an elephant    and when you had to run away  and when you couldn't run away  and when you had to climb a tree    when you could never climb a tree. I would have died in a day  but he was born there  and he understood how to survive. I was born in New York City. I could have taken him to New York  and he would have died in a day. Because we had different models based on our different experiences. Models can come from the media  from our elected officials. Think of models of terrorism  child kidnapping  airline safety  car safety. Models can come from industry. The two I'm following are surveillance cameras  ID cards  quite a lot of our computer security models come from there. A lot of models come from science. Health models are a great example. Think of cancer  of bird flu  swine flu  SARS. All of our feelings of security about those diseases come from models given to us  really  by science filtered through the media. So models can change. Models are not static. As we become more comfortable in our environments  our model can move closer to our feelings. So an example might be  if you go back     years ago when electricity was first becoming common  there were a lot of fears about it. I mean  there were people who were afraid to push doorbells  because there was electricity in there  and that was dangerous. For us  we're very facile around electricity. We change light bulbs without even thinking about it. Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into. It hasn't changed as we were growing up. And we're good at it. Or think of the risks on the Internet across generations    how your parents approach Internet security  versus how you do  versus how our kids will. Models eventually fade into the background. Intuitive is just another word for familiar. So as your model is close to reality  and it converges with feelings  you often don't know it's there. So a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu. When swine flu first appeared  the initial news caused a lot of overreaction. Now it had a name  which made it scarier than the regular flu  even though it was more deadly. And people thought doctors should be able to deal with it. So there was that feeling of lack of control. And those two things made the risk more than it was. As the novelty wore off  the months went by  there was some amount of tolerance  people got used to it. There was no new data  but there was less fear. By autumn  people thought the doctors should have solved this already. And there's kind of a bifurcation    people had to choose between fear and acceptance    actually fear and indifference    they kind of chose suspicion. And when the vaccine appeared last winter  there were a lot of people    a surprising number    who refused to get it    as a nice example of how people's feelings of security change  how their model changes  sort of wildly with no new information  with no new input. This kind of thing happens a lot. I'm going to give one more complication. We have feeling  model  reality. I have a very relativistic view of security. I think it depends on the observer. And most security decisions have a variety of people involved. And stakeholders with specific trade offs will try to influence the decision. And I call that their agenda. And you see agenda    this is marketing  this is politics    trying to convince you to have one model versus another  trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings  marginalizing people with models you don't like. This is not uncommon. An example  a great example  is the risk of smoking. In the history of the past    years  the smoking risk shows how a model changes  and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like. Compare that to the secondhand smoke debate    probably about    years behind. Think about seat belts. When I was a kid  no one wore a seat belt. Nowadays  no kid will let you drive if you're not wearing a seat belt. Compare that to the airbag debate    probably about    years behind. All examples of models changing. What we learn is that changing models is hard. Models are hard to dislodge. If they equal your feelings  you don't even know you have a model. And there's another cognitive bias I'll call confirmation bias  where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs. So evidence against our model  we're likely to ignore  even if it's compelling. It has to get very compelling before we'll pay attention. New models that extend long periods of time are hard. Global warming is a great example. We're terrible at models that span    years. We can do to the next harvest. We can often do until our kids grow up. But    years  we're just not good at. So it's a very hard model to accept. We can have both models in our head simultaneously  right  that kind of problem where we're holding both beliefs together  right  the cognitive dissonance. Eventually  the new model will replace the old model. Strong feelings can create a model. September   th created a security model in a lot of people's heads. Also  personal experiences with crime can do it  personal health scare  a health scare in the news. You'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists. They can create a model instantaneously  because they're very emotive. So in the technological world  we don't have experience to judge models. And we rely on others. We rely on proxies. I mean  this works as long as it's to correct others. We rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe. I flew here yesterday. I didn't check the airplane. I relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly. We're here  none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us  not because we checked  but because we're pretty sure the building codes here are good. It's a model we just accept pretty much by faith. And that's okay. Now  what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models    have it reflected in their feelings    to allow them to make security trade offs. Now when these go out of whack  you have two options. One  you can fix people's feelings  directly appeal to feelings. It's manipulation  but it can work. The second  more honest way is to actually fix the model. Change happens slowly. The smoking debate took    years  and that was an easy one. Some of this stuff is hard. I mean really though  information seems like our best hope. And I lied. Remember I said feeling  model  reality  I said reality doesn't change. It actually does. We live in a technological world  reality changes all the time. So we might have    for the first time in our species    feeling chases model  model chases reality  reality's moving    they might never catch up. We don't know. But in the long term  both feeling and reality are important. And I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this.         I don't know if people will remember this    there was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings in the United States. It's a horrific story. Someone took a bottle of Tylenol  put poison in it  closed it up  put it back on the shelf. Someone else bought it and died. This terrified people. There were a couple of copycat attacks. There wasn't any real risk  but people were scared. And this is how the tamper proof drug industry was invented. Those tamper proof caps  that came from this. It's complete security theater. As a homework assignment  think of    ways to get around it. I'll give you one  a syringe. But it made people feel better. It made their feeling of security more match the reality. Last story  a few years ago  a friend of mine gave birth. I visit her in the hospital. It turns out when a baby's born now  they put an RFID bracelet on the baby  put a corresponding one on the mother  so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward  an alarm goes off. I said   Well  that's kind of neat. I wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals.  I go home  I look it up. It basically never happens. But if you think about it  if you are a hospital  and you need to take a baby away from its mother  out of the room to run some tests  you better have some good security theater  or she's going to rip your arm off. So it's important for us  those of us who design security  who look at security policy  or even look at public policy in ways that affect security. It's not just reality  it's feeling and reality. What's important is that they be about the same. It's important that  if our feelings match reality  we make better security trade offs. Thank you. I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials. I brought along with me an abalone shell. This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's    percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein. Yet  it's       times tougher than its geological counterpart. And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells  like chalk. I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials  and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job. Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure  but they're formed at the nanoscale. They're formed at the nanoscale  and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures. So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non living structures  like batteries and like solar cells  What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did  in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure  using non toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment  So that's the vision that I've been thinking about. And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish  Or  what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time  and do so in an environmentally friendly way  And so  going back to this abalone shell  besides being nano structured  one thing that's fascinating  is when a male and a female abalone get together  they pass on the genetic information that says   This is how to build an exquisite material. Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure  using non toxic materials.  Same with diatoms  which are shown right here  which are glasseous structures. Every time the diatoms replicate  they give the genetic information that says   Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano structured. And you can do it the same  over and over again.  So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery  I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old. But anyone who's ever had  or knows  small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms. And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do  it's very difficult. So when we think about future technologies  we actually think of using bacteria and virus  simple organisms. Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox  so that they can build a structure that will be important to me  Also  when we think about future technologies  we start with the beginning of Earth. Basically  it took a billion years to have life on Earth. And very rapidly  they became multi cellular  they could replicate  they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source. But it wasn't until about     million years ago    during the Cambrian geologic time period    that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials. Before that  they were all soft  fluffy structures. And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment  and organisms learned how to make hard materials. And so that's what I would like be able to do    convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table. Now if you look at biology  there's many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you've heard about that are already nano structured. So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale. What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV  But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us  So here are some examples  these are some natural shells. There are natural biological materials. The abalone shell here    and if you fracture it  you can look at the fact that it's nano structured. There's diatoms made out of SIO   and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small  single domain magnets used for navigation. What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale  and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures. Now  going back to the abalone shell  the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins. These proteins are very negatively charged. And they can pull calcium out of the environment  put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate  calcium and carbonate. It has the chemical sequences of amino acids  which says   This is how to build the structure. Here's the DNA sequence  here's the protein sequence in order to do it.  And so an interesting idea is  what if you could take any material that you wanted  or any element on the periodic table  and find its corresponding DNA sequence  then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure  but not build an abalone shell    build something that  through nature  it has never had the opportunity to work with yet. And so here's the periodic table. And I absolutely love the periodic table. Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT  I have a periodic table made that says   Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element.  And you flip it over  and it's the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges. And so I give this out to thousands of people. And I know it says MIT  and this is Caltech  but I have a couple extra if people want it. And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT  and I really wanted to give him a periodic table. So I stayed up at night  and I talked to my husband   How do I give President Obama a periodic table  What if he says  'Oh  I already have one ' or  'I've already memorized it'    Laughter  And so he came to visit my lab and looked around    it was a great visit. And then afterward  I said   Sir  I want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight.  And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass. And so he looked at it  and he said   Thank you. I'll look at it periodically.  And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy  he pulled it out and said   And people at MIT  they give out periodic tables.  So basically what I didn't tell you is that about     million years ago  organisms starter making materials  but it took them about    million years to get good at it. It took them about    million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell. And that's a hard sell to a graduate student.  Laughter   I have this great project       million years.  And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly. And so we use a virus that's a non toxic virus called M   bacteriophage that's job is to infect bacteria. Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it. And by doing that  it allows the virus to express random protein sequences. And this is pretty easy biotechnology. And you could basically do this a billion times. And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical  but they differ from each other based on their tips  on one sequence that codes for one protein. Now if you take all billion viruses  and you can put them in one drop of liquid  you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table. And through a process of selection evolution  you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you'd like it to do  like grow a battery or grow a solar cell. So basically  viruses can't replicate themselves  they need a host. Once you find that one out of a billion  you infect it into a bacteria  and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence. And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales. And these viruses are long and skinny  and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries. Now this is a high powered battery that we grew in my lab. We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes. So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube. The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery. And then it wires itself to the current collector. And so through a process of selection evolution  we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record breaking  high powered battery that's all made at room temperature  basically at the bench top. And that battery went to the White House for a press conference. I brought it here. You can see it in this case    that's lighting this LED. Now if we could scale this  you could actually use it to run your Prius  which is my dream    to be able to drive a virus powered car. But it's basically    you can pull one out of a billion. You can make lots of amplifications to it. Basically  you make an amplification in the lab  and then you get it to self assemble into a structure like a battery. We're able to do this also with catalysis. This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water. And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna  and you get an energy transfer across the virus. And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels. And I brought an example with me of that today. My students promised me it would work. These are virus assembled nanowires. When you shine light on them  you can see them bubbling. In this case  you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out. And basically  by controlling the genes  you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance. The last example are solar cells. You can also do this with solar cells. We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them    and use as a way of getting electrons through the device. And what we've found is through genetic engineering  we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye sensitized systems. And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward. So this is a virus based solar cell. Through evolution and selection  we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an    percent efficiency solar cell. So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great  interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials    and taking it the next step to see if you can force  or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials  to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making. Thank you. So for the past year and a half  my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature length interactive book. It's called  Our Choice  and the author is Al Gore. It's the sequel to  An Inconvenient Truth   and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. The book starts like this. This is the cover. As the globe spins  we can see our location  and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. Or  we can scroll through the pages at the bottom. And if we wanted to zoom into a page  we can just open it up. And anything you see in the book  you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. And if you want to go back and read the book again  you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. And so this works the same way  you pick it up and pop it open. among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. Mike Matas  And so throughout the whole book  Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. This photo  you can you can even see on an interactive map. Zoom into it and see where it was taken. And throughout the book  there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. So you can open this one. MM  It starts playing immediately. And while it's playing  we can pinch and peak back at the page  and the movie keeps playing. Or we can zoom out to the table of contents  and the video keeps playing. But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. This one shows the wind potential all around the United States. But instead of just showing us the information  we can take our finger and explore  and see  state by state  exactly how much wind potential there is. We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. This is one of my favorites. So this shows ... When the wind is blowing  any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. And as the wind starts dying down  any excess energy will be diverted back into the house    the lights never go out. And this whole book  it doesn't just run on the iPad. It also runs on the iPhone. And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. And it works the exact same way. You can pinch into any page. Open it up. So that's Push Pop Press' first title  Al Gore's  Our Choice.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  That's spectacular. Do you want to be a publisher  a technology licenser  What is the business here  Is this something that other people can do  MM  Yeah  we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. So Melcher Media's team  who's on the East coast    and we're on the West coast  building the software    takes our tool and  every day  drags in images and text. CA  So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that   MM  Yes.  All right. Mike  thanks so much. MM  Thank you.  CA  Good luck.  My name is Arvind Gupta  and I'm a toymaker. I've been making toys for the last    years. The early '  s  I was in college. It was a very revolutionary time. It was a political ferment  so to say    students out in the streets of Paris  revolting against authority. America was jolted by the anti Vietnam movement  the Civil Rights movement. In India  we had the Naxalite movement  the  unclear  movement. But you know  when there is a political churning of society  it unleashes a lot of energy. The National Movement of India was testimony to that. Lots of people resigned from well paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement. Now in the early '  s  one of the great programs in India was to revitalize primary science in village schools. There was a person  Anil Sadgopal  did a Ph.D. from Caltech and returned back as a molecular biologist in India's cutting edge research institute  the TIFR. At     he was not able to relate the kind of  unclear  research  which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people. So he designed and went and started a village science program. Many people were inspired by this. The slogan of the early '  s was  Go to the people. Live with them  love them. Start from what they know. Build on what they have.  This was kind of the defining slogan. Well I took one year. I joined Telco  made TATA trucks  pretty close to Pune. I worked there for two years  and I realized that I was not born to make trucks. Often one doesn't know what one wants to do  but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do. So I took one year off  and I went to this village science program. And it was a turning point. It was a very small village    a weekly bazaar where people  just once in a week  they put in all the vats. So I said   I'm going to spend a year over here.  So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside. And one thing which I found was this black rubber. This is called a cycle valve tube. When you pump in air in a bicycle  you use a bit of this. And some of these models    so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube  you can put two matchsticks inside this  and you make a flexible joint. It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles    an acute angle  a right angle  an obtuse angle  a straight angle. It's like its own little coupling. If you have three of them  and you loop them together  well you make a triangle. With four  you make a square  you make a pentagon  you make a hexagon  you make all these kind of polygons. And they have some wonderful properties. If you look at the hexagon  for instance  it's like an amoeba  which is constantly changing its own profile. You can just pull this out  this becomes a rectangle. You give it a push  this becomes a parallelogram. But this is very shaky. Look at the pentagon  for instance  pull this out    it becomes a boat shape trapezium. Push it and it becomes house shaped. This becomes an isosceles triangle    again  very shaky. This square might look very square and prim. Give it a little push    this becomes a rhombus. It becomes kite shaped. But give a child a triangle  he can't do a thing to it. Why use triangles  Because triangles are the only rigid structures. We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come  it would start doing a jig. Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India  they might not have gone to engineering college  but no one makes a roof placed like this. Because if they put tiles on top  it's just going to crash. They always make a triangular roof. Now this is people science. And if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick  you'll get a T joint. And if I were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle  I would make a tetrahedron. So you make all these  D shapes. You make a tetrahedron like this. And once you make these  you make a little house. Put this on top. You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six. You just need a ton. Now this was    you make a joint of six  you make an icosahedron. You can play around with it. This makes an igloo. Now this is in     . I was a    year old young engineer. And I thought this was so much better than making trucks. If you  as a matter of fact  put four marbles inside  you simulate the molecular structure of methane  CH . Four atoms of hydrogen  the four points of the tetrahedron  which means the little carbon atom. Well since then  I just thought that I've been really privileged to go to over       schools in my country    village schools  government schools  municipal schools  Ivy League schools    I've been invited by most of them. And every time I go to a school  I see a gleam in the eyes of the children. I see hope. I see happiness in their faces. Children want to make things. Children want to do things. Now this  we make lots and lots of pumps. Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon. It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon. And we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it. So all you do is    it's a very kind of provocative statement    this old bicycle tube and this old plastic  unclear  This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube. And this is how you make a valve. You put a little sticky tape. This is one way traffic. Well we make lots and lots of pumps. And this is the other one    that you just take a straw  and you just put a stick inside and you make two half cuts. Now this is what you do  is you bend both these legs into a triangle  and you just wrap some tape around. And this is the pump. And now  if you have this pump  it's like a great  great sprinkler. It's like a centrifuge. If you spin something  it tends to fly out. Well in terms of    if you were in Andhra Pradesh  you would make this with the palmyra leaf. Many of our folk toys have great science principles. If you spin top something  it tends to fly out. If I do it with both hands  you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man. Right. This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing. There are four pictures. You see insects  you see frogs  snakes  eagles  butterflies  frogs  snakes  eagles. Here's a paper which you could  unclear     designed by a mathematician at Harvard in       Arthur Stone  documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books. But this is great fun for children. They all study about the food chain. The insects are eaten by the frogs  the frogs are eaten by the snakes  the snakes are eaten by the eagles. And this can be  if you had a whole photocopy paper    A  size paper    you could be in a municipal school  you could be in a government school    a paper  a scale and a pencil    no glue  no scissors. In three minutes  you just fold this up. And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination. If you take a smaller paper  you make a smaller flexagon. With a bigger one  you make a bigger one. Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here. And you put a little fan here. And this is a hundred year old toy. There have been six major research papers on this. There's some grooves over here  you can see. And if I take a reed    if I rub this  something very amazing happens. Six major research papers on this. As a matter of fact  Feynman  as a child  was very fascinated by this. He wrote a paper on this. And you don't need the three billion dollar Hadron Collider for doing this.  Laughter   Applause  This is there for every child  and every child can enjoy this. If you want to put a colored disk  well all these seven colors coalesce. And this is what Newton talked about     years back  that white light's made of seven colors  just by spinning this around. This is a straw. What we've done  we've just sealed both the ends with tape  nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner  so there's holes in the opposite corners  there's a little hole over here. This is a kind of a blowing straw. I just put this inside this. There's a hole here  and I shut this. And this costs very little money to make    great fun for children to do. What we do is make a very simple electric motor. Now this is the simplest motor on Earth. The most expensive thing is the battery inside this. If you have a battery  it costs five cents to make it. This is an old bicycle tube  which gives you a broad rubber band  two safety pins. This is a permanent magnet. Whenever current flows through the coil  this becomes an electromagnet. It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin. We made       . Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years  they just muck up the definition and they spit it out. When teachers make it  children make it. You can see a gleam in their eye. They get a thrill of what science is all about. And this science is not a rich man's game. In a democratic country  science must reach to our most oppressed  to the most marginalized children. This program started with    schools and spread to       government schools. Over         children learn science this way. And we're just trying to see possibilities. Look  this is the tetrapak    awful materials from the point of view of the environment. There are six layers    three layers of plastic  aluminum    which are are sealed together. They are fused together  so you can't separate them. Now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron. So something which is trash  which is choking all the seabirds  you could just recycle this into a very  very joyous    all the platonic solids can be made with things like this. This is a little straw  and what you do is you just nip two corners here  and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth. You put this in your mouth  and you blow. It's children's delight  a teacher's envy  as they say. You're not able to see how the sound is produced  because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth. I'm going to keep this outside  to blow out. I'm going to suck in air. So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations. The other is that you keep blowing at it  keep making the sound  and you keep cutting it. And something very  very nice happens. And when you get a very small one    This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this. Well before I go any further  this is something worth sharing. This is a touching slate meant for blind children. This is strips of Velcro  this is my drawing slate  and this is my drawing pen  which is basically a film box. It's basically like a fisherman's line  a fishing line. And this is wool over here. If I crank the handle  all the wool goes inside. And what a blind child can do is to just draw this. Wool sticks on Velcro. There are    million blind children in our country    who live in a world of darkness. And this has come as a great boon to them. There's a factory out there making our children blind  not able to provide them with food  not able to provide them with vitamin A. But this has come as a great boon for them. There are no patents. Anyone can make it. This is very  very simple. You can see  this is the generator. It's a crank generator. These are two magnets. This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs. Small pulley and two strong magnets. And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED. If I spin this pulley  the small one's going to spin much faster. There will be a spinning magnetic field. Lines  of course  would be cut  the force will be generated. And you can see  this LED is going to glow. So this is a small crank generator. Well  this is  again  it's just a ring  a steel ring with steel nuts. And what you can do is just  if you give it a twirl  well they just keep going on. And imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on. And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this. Well in the end  what we can also do  we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps. This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar. It's a great cricket cap.  Laughter   Applause  When first you see Nehru and Gandhi  this is the Nehru cap    just half a newspaper. We make lots of toys with newspapers  and this is one of them. And this is    you can see    this is a flapping bird. All of our old newspapers  we cut them into little squares. And if you have one of these birds    children in Japan have been making this bird for many  many years. And you can see  this is a little fantail bird. Well in the end  I'll just end with a story. This is called  The Captain's Hat Story.  The captain was a captain of a sea going ship. It goes very slowly. And there were lots of passengers on the ship  and they were getting bored  so the captain invited them on the deck.  Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance  and I'll provide you with good food and drinks.  And the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia. The first day  it was a huge umbrella cap  like a captain's cap. That night  when the passengers would be sleeping  he would give it one more fold  and the second day  he would be wearing a fireman's cap    with a little shoot just like a designer cap  because it protects the spinal cord. And the second night  he would take the same cap and give it another fold. And the third day  it would be a Shikari cap    just like an adventurer's cap. And the third night  he would give it two more folds    and this is a very  very famous cap. If you've seen any of our Bollywood films  this is what the policeman wears  it's called a zapalu cap. It's been catapulted to international glory. And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship. So that's a ship. And now the end  everyone was enjoying the journey very much. They were singing and dancing. Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves. And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves. A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down. And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down. And there's a third one over here. This swallows the bridge and knocks it down. And the ship sinks  and the captain has lost everything  but for a life jacket. Thank you so much. Mark Zuckerberg  a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed. And the journalist was asking him   Why is this so important   And Zuckerberg said   A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.  And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like. So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine  the Internet meant something very different to me. It meant a connection to the world. It meant something that would connect us all together. And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society. But there's this shift in how information is flowing online  and it's invisible. And if we don't pay attention to it  it could be a real problem. So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time    my Facebook page. I'm progressive  politically    big surprise    but I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives. I like hearing what they're thinking about  I like seeing what they link to  I like learning a thing or two. And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed. And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on  and it was noticing that  actually  I was clicking more on my liberal friends' links than on my conservative friends' links. And without consulting me about it  it had edited them out. They disappeared. So Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible  algorithmic editing of the Web. Google's doing it too. If I search for something  and you search for something  even right now at the very same time  we may get very different search results. Even if you're logged out  one engineer told me  there are    signals that Google looks at    everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located    that it uses to personally tailor your query results. Think about it for a second  there is no standard Google anymore. And you know  the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see. You can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's. But a couple of weeks ago  I asked a bunch of friends to Google  Egypt  and to send me screen shots of what they got. So here's my friend Scott's screen shot. And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot. When you put them side by side  you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are. But when you do read the links  it's really quite remarkable. Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results. Scott's results were full of them. And this was the big story of the day at that time. That's how different these results are becoming. So it's not just Google and Facebook either. This is something that's sweeping the Web. There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization. Yahoo News  the biggest news site on the Internet  is now personalized    different people get different things. Huffington Post  the Washington Post  the New York Times    all flirting with personalization in various ways. And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see  but not necessarily what we need to see. As Eric Schmidt said   It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them.  So I do think this is a problem. And I think  if you take all of these filters together  you take all these algorithms  you get what I call a filter bubble. And your filter bubble is your own personal  unique universe of information that you live in online. And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are  and it depends on what you do. But the thing is that you don't decide what gets in. And more importantly  you don't actually see what gets edited out. So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix. And they were looking at the Netflix queues  and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed  which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses. They enter the queue  they just zip right out. So  Iron Man  zips right out  and  Waiting for Superman  can wait for a really long time. What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves. You know we all want to be someone who has watched  Rashomon   but right now we want to watch  Ace Ventura  for the fourth time. So the best editing gives us a bit of both. It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan. It gives us some information vegetables  it gives us some information dessert. And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters  these personalized filters  is that  because they're mainly looking at what you click on first  it can throw off that balance. And instead of a balanced information diet  you can end up surrounded by information junk food. What this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong. In a broadcast society    this is how the founding mythology goes    in a broadcast society  there were these gatekeepers  the editors  and they controlled the flows of information. And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way  and it allowed all of us to connect together  and it was awesome. But that's not actually what's happening right now. What we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones. And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did. So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us  if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see  then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance. We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important    this is what TED does    other points of view. And the thing is  we've actually been here before as a society. In       it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities. Then people noticed that they were doing something really important. That  in fact  you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information  that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter  and then journalistic ethics developed. It wasn't perfect  but it got us through the last century. And so now  we're kind of back in      on the Web. And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing. I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google    Larry and Sergey    people who have helped build the Web as it is  and I'm grateful for that. But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life  a sense of civic responsibility. We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters. And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't. Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being. We need it to connect us all together. We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives. And it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one. Thank you. Phyllis Rodriguez  We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship. And it is. And yet  it feels natural to us now. I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September   th      . We didn't know if he had perished yet until    hours later. At the time  we knew that it was political. We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son    my husband  Orlando  and I and our family. And when I saw it    and yet  through the shock  the terrible shock  and the terrible explosion in our lives  literally  we were not vengeful. And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism  and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him  if convicted  my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that  publicly. Through that and through human rights groups  we were brought together with several other victims' families. When I saw Aicha in the media  coming over when her son was indicted  and I thought   What a brave woman. Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger.  I was still in deep grief  I knew I didn't have the strength. I knew I would find her someday  or we would find each other. Because  when people heard that my son was a victim  I got immediate sympathy. But when people learned what her son was accused of  she didn't get that sympathy. But her suffering is equal to mine. So we met in November       and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui. And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. So they introduced me to five families. And I saw Phyllis  and I watched her. She was the only mother in the group. The others were brothers  sisters. And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother  just like me. I suffered a lot as a mother. I was married when I was   . I lost a child when I was     a second child when I was   . So the story with Zacarias was too much really. And I still suffer  because my son is like he's buried alive. I know she really cried for her son. But she knows where he is. My son  I don't know where he is. I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured. I don't know what happened to him. So that's why I decided to tell my story  so that my suffering is something positive for other women. For all the women  all the mothers that give life  you can give back  you can change. It's up to us women  because we are women  because we love our children. We must be hand in hand and do something together. It's not against women  it's for us  for us women  for our children. I talk against violence  against terrorism. I go to schools to talk to young  Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young. So if I can save one of the young girls  and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did  well this is something good. This is why I'm here in front of you. PR  I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha  starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members    which was a very private meeting with security  because it was November       and  frankly  we were afraid of the super patriotism of that time in the country    those of us family members. But we were all so nervous.  Why does she want to meet us   And then she was nervous.  Why did we want to meet her   What did we want from each other  Before we knew each others' names  or anything  we had embraced and wept. Then we sat in a circle with support  with help  from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. And Aicha started  and she said   I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent  but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families. I know what it is to suffer  and I feel that if there is a crime  a person should be tried fairly and punished.  But she reached out to us in that way  and it was  I'd like to say  it was an ice breaker. And what happened then is we all told our stories  and we all connected as human beings. By the end of the afternoon    it was about three hours after lunch    we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. Now what I learned from her  is a woman  not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then  and what was being done to her son  but the life she's had. I never had met someone with such a hard life  from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. And I feel that we have a special connection  which I value very much. And I think it's all about being afraid of the other  but making that step and then realizing   Hey  this wasn't so hard. Who else can I meet that I don't know  or that I'm so different from   So  Aicha  do you have a couple of words for conclusion  Because our time is up. that we have to try to know other people  the other. You have to be generous  and your hearts must be generous  your mind must be generous. You must be tolerant. You have to fight against violence. And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other. This is what I wanted to say. Good afternoon  everybody. I've got something to show you. Think about this as a pixel  a flying pixel. This is what we call  in our lab  sensible design. Let me tell you a bit about it. Now if you take this picture    I'm Italian originally  and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom    but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula   racing over the past couple of decades. Now some time ago  if you wanted to win a Formula   race  you take a budget  and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car. And if the car and the driver were good enough  then you'd win the race. Now today  if you want to win the race  actually you need also something like this    something that monitors the car in real time  has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car  transmitting this information into the system  and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected. This is what  in engineering terms  you would call a real time control system. And basically  it's a system made of two components    a sensing and an actuating component. What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives. Our cities  over the past few years  just have been blanketed with networks  electronics. They're becoming like computers in open air. And  as computers in open air  they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated. If we fix cities  actually it's a big deal. Just as an aside  I wanted to mention  cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust  but they are    percent of the world's population. They are    percent of the energy consumption    up to    percent of CO  emissions. So if we're able to do something with cities  that's a big deal. Beyond cities  all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects. That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year  during the summer. It's called  Talk to Me.  Well our objects  our environment is starting to talk back to us. In a certain sense  it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator. And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there. In a certain sense  it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ... you know  when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses  at the end it said that he took the hammer  threw it at the Moses    actually you can still see a small chip underneath    and said  shouted   Perch  non parli  Why don't you talk   Well today  for the first time  our environment is starting to talk back to us. And I'll show just a few examples    again  with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it. Let's starting with sensing. Well  the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab. It was four and a half years ago in Italy. And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world    that's a cellphone network    and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network  that's collected anyway by the operator  in order to understand how the city works. The summer was a lucky summer        . It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup. Some of you might remember  it was Italy and France playing  and then Zidane at the end  the headbutt. And anyway  Italy won at the end. Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network. Here you see the city. You see the Colosseum in the middle  the river Tiber. It's morning  before the match. You see the timeline on the top. Early afternoon  people here and there  making calls and moving. The match begins    silence. France scores. Italy scores. Halftime  people make a quick call and go to the bathroom. Second half. End of normal time. First overtime  second. Zidane  the headbutt in a moment. Italy wins. Yeah. Well  that night  everybody went to celebrate in the center. You saw the big peak. The following day  again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time. And then everybody moved down. You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo  where  since Roman times  people go to celebrate  to have a big party  and you see the peak at the end of the day. Well  that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago. Another quick example about sensing  it's not about people  but about things we use and consume. Well today  we know everything about where our objects come from. This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer  how they came together. But we know very little about where things go. So in this project  we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system. So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle  just over a year ago  to tag what they were throwing away    different types of things  as you can see here    things they would throw away anyway. Then we put a little chip  little tag  onto the trash and then started following it. Here are the results we just obtained. From Seattle ... after one week. With this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system. We can actually do the same thing with much less energy. This data was not available before. But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening. But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away  it doesn't disappear  it's still somewhere on the planet. And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there. And if we show that to people  then we can also promote some behavioral change. So that was the reason for the project. My colleague at MIT  Assaf Biderman  he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing  but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning  and that's actuating our environment. And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza  Spain. It started with a question by the mayor of the city  who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space  in architecture. And the question was  How could technology  new technology  be added to that  And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was  imagine this pipe  and you've got valves  solenoid valves  taps  opening and closing. You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water. If those pixels fall  you can write on it  you can show patterns  images  text. And even you can approach it  and it will open up to let you jump through  as you see in this image. Well  we presented this to Mayor Belloch. He liked it very much. And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo. We called it Digital Water Pavilion. The whole building is made of water. There's no doors or windows  but when you approach it  it will open up to let you in. The roof also is covered with water. And if there's a bit of wind  if you want to minimize splashing  you can actually lower the roof. Or you could close the building  and the whole architecture will disappear  like in this case. You know  these days  you always get images during the winter  when they take the roof down  of people who have been there and said   They demolished the building.  No  they didn't demolish it  just when it goes down  the architecture almost disappears. Here's the building working. You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside. And here was myself trying not to get wet  testing the sensors that open the water. Well  I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working. But actually that night  it was even more fun. All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building  because the way of engaging with the building became something different. Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in  but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water  and you had to jump without getting wet. And that was  for us  was very interesting  because  as architects  as engineers  as designers  we always think about how people will use the things we design. But then reality's always unpredictable. And that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people. Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels  the pixels made of water  and then projections on them. And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now. That's  imagine those pixels could actually start flying. Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air  and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights    almost as a cloud that can move in space. Here is the video. So imagine one helicopter  like the one we saw before  moving with others  in synchrony. So you can have this cloud. You can have a kind of flexible screen or display  like this    a regular configuration in two dimensions. Or in regular  but in three dimensions  where the thing that changes is the light  not the pixels' position. You can play with a different type. Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes  different types of resolution. But then the whole thing can be just a  D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many  many directions. Here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before. When you turn on the light  actually you see this. So the same as we saw before. And imagine each of them then controlled by people. You can have each pixel having an input that comes from people  from people's movement  or so and so. I want to show you something here for the first time. We've been working with Roberto Bolle  one of today's top ballet dancers    the  toile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan    and actually captured his movement in  D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire. And here you can see Roberto dancing. You see on the left the pixels  the different resolutions being captured. It's both  D scanning in real time and motion capture. So you can reconstruct a whole movement. You can go all the way through. But then  once we have the pixels  then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation. So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for Flyfire. I wanted to show you the last project we are working on. It's something we're working on for the London Olympics. It's called The Cloud. And the idea here is  imagine  again  we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment    almost to impart what we call cloud raising    like barn raising  but with a cloud. Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel. And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that  over the past couple of decades  we went from the physical world to the digital one. This has been digitizing everything  knowledge  and making that accessible through the Internet. Now today  for the first time    and the Obama campaign showed us this    we can go from the digital world  from the self organizing power of networks  to the physical one. This can be  in our case  we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol. That means something built in a city. But tomorrow it can be  in order to tackle today's pressing challenges    think about climate change or CO  emissions    how we can go from the digital world to the physical one. So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together  collectively. The cloud is a cloud  again  made of pixels  in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles. And those particles are water  where our cloud is a cloud of pixels. It's a physical structure in London  but covered with pixels. You can move inside  have different types of experiences. You can actually see from underneath  sharing the main moments for the Olympics in      and beyond  and really using it as a way to connect with the community. So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top  of   like London's new mountaintop. You can enter inside it. And a kind of new digital beacon for the night    but most importantly  a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top. Thank you. So as a fashion designer  I've always tended to think of materials something like this  or this  or maybe this. But then I met a biologist  and now I think of materials like this    green tea  sugar  a few microbes and a little time. I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe  which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria  yeasts and other micro organisms  which spin cellulose in a fermentation process. Over time  these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface. So we start by brewing the tea. I brew up to about    liters of tea at a time  and then while it's still hot  add a couple of kilos of sugar. We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath. We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below    degrees C. And then we're ready to add the living organism. And along with that  some acetic acid. And once you get this process going  you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid. We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth. And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it. And actually  in hot weather  I can just grow it outside. So this is my mini fabric farm. After about three days  the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid. So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing. And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid. So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose. And they're sticking together  forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface. After about two to three weeks  we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness. So the bath on the left is after five days  and on the right  after   . And this is a static culture. You don't have to do anything to it  you just literally watch it grow. It doesn't need light. And when it's ready to harvest  you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold  soapy water. At this point  it's really heavy. It's over    percent water  so we need to let that evaporate. So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet. Again  you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air. And as it's drying  it's compressing  so what you're left with  depending on the recipe  is something that's either like a really light weight  transparent paper  or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather. And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally  or you can use the wet material to form it around a three dimensional shape. And as it evaporates  it will knit itself together  forming seams. So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea. I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin  which intrigues me. Since it's organic  I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals. I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation. Using fruit and vegetable staining  create organic patterning. And using indigo  make it anti microbial. And in fact  cotton would take up to    dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark. And because of the super absorbency of this kind of cellulose  it just takes one  and a really short one at that. What I can't yet do is make it water resistant. So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today  I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water. The dress would get really heavy  and eventually the seams would probably fall apart    leaving me feeling rather naked. Possibly a good performance piece  but definitely not ideal for everyday wear. What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need. So what I want to do is say to a future bug   Spin me a thread. Align it in this direction. Make it hydrophobic. And while you're at it  just form it around this  D shape.  Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing  and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels  possibly even replacement bone tissue. But with synthetic biology  we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality  quantity and shape of material that we desire. Obviously  as a designer  that's really exciting because then I start to think  wow  we could actually imagine growing consumable products. What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency. So we only grow what we need. There's no waste. And in fact  we could make it from a waste stream    so for example  a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant. Finally  at the end of use  we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings. What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton  leather or other textile materials. But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources. Ultimately  maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact. We could  for example  imagine growing a lamp  a chair  a car or maybe even a house. So I guess what my question to you is  in the future  what would you choose to grow  Thank you very much. Bruno Giussani  Suzanne  just a curiosity  what you're wearing is not random.  Suzanne Lee  No.  This is one of the jackets you grew  SL  Yes  it is. It's probably    part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes. It's absorbing my sweat  and it's feeding on it. BG  Okay  so we'll let you go and save it  and rescue it. Suzanne Lee.  SL  Thank you.  The universe is really big. We live in a galaxy  the Milky Way Galaxy. There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky  and you just keep the shutter open  as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope  it will see something like this. Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way    a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs. There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe.     billion is the only number you need to know. The age of the universe  between now and the Big Bang  is a hundred billion in dog years. Which tells you something about our place in the universe. One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it. It's extremely beautiful. I've often wondered  what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn't have any. But we would also like to understand it. As a cosmologist  I want to ask  why is the universe like this  One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time. If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity  it would be moving away from you. And if you look at a galaxy even farther away  it would be moving away faster. So we say the universe is expanding. What that means  of course  is that  in the past  things were closer together. In the past  the universe was more dense  and it was also hotter. If you squeeze things together  the temperature goes up. That kind of makes sense to us. The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much is that the universe  at early times  near the Big Bang  was also very  very smooth. You might think that that's not a surprise. The air in this room is very smooth. You might say   Well  maybe things just smoothed themselves out.  But the conditions near the Big Bang are very  very different than the conditions of the air in this room. In particular  things were a lot denser. The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the Big Bang. What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies  a hundred billion stars each. At early times  those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big    literally    at early times. And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections  without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else. Because if there had been  they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole. Keeping the universe very  very smooth at early times is not easy  it's a delicate arrangement. It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly. There is something that made it that way. We would like to know what. So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann  an Austrian physicist in the   th century. And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy. You've heard of entropy. It's the randomness  the disorder  the chaoticness of some systems. Boltzmann gave us a formula    engraved on his tombstone now    that really quantifies what entropy is. And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice  so that macroscopically it looks the same. If you have the air in this room  you don't notice each individual atom. A low entropy configuration is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way. A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way. This is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics    the law that says that entropy increases in the universe  or in some isolated bit of the universe. The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy. That's a wonderful insight  but it leaves something out. This insight that entropy increases  by the way  is what's behind what we call the arrow of time  the difference between the past and the future. Every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing    the fact that you can remember the past  but not the future. The fact that you are born  and then you live  and then you die  always in that order  that's because entropy is increasing. Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy  it's very natural for it to increase because there's more ways to be high entropy. What he didn't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place. The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very  very smooth. We'd like to understand that. That's our job as cosmologists. Unfortunately  it's actually not a problem that we've been giving enough attention to. It's not one of the first things people would say  if you asked a modern cosmologist   What are the problems we're trying to address   One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman.    years ago  he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures. He gave the popular lectures that became  The Character of Physical Law.  He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads that became  The Feynman Lectures on Physics.  He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became  The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation.  In every one of these books  every one of these sets of lectures  he emphasized this puzzle  Why did the early universe have such a small entropy  So he says    I'm not going to do the accent    he says   For some reason  the universe  at one time  had a very low entropy for its energy content  and since then the entropy has increased. The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding.  So that's our job. We want to know    this is    years ago   Surely   you're thinking   we've figured it out by now.  It's not true that we've figured it out by now. The reason the problem has gotten worse  rather than better  is because in      we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before. We learned that it's accelerating. The universe is not only expanding. If you look at the galaxy  it's moving away. If you come back a billion years later and look at it again  it will be moving away faster. Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating. Unlike the low entropy of the early universe  even though we don't know the answer for this  we at least have a good theory that can explain it  if that theory is right  and that's the theory of dark energy. It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy. In every little cubic centimeter of space  whether or not there's stuff  whether or not there's particles  matter  radiation or whatever  there's still energy  even in the space itself. And this energy  according to Einstein  exerts a push on the universe. It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other. Because dark energy  unlike matter or radiation  does not dilute away as the universe expands. The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same  even as the universe gets bigger and bigger. This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future. For one thing  the universe will expand forever. Back when I was your age  we didn't know what the universe was going to do. Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future. Einstein was fond of this idea. But if there's dark energy  and the dark energy does not go away  the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.    billion years in the past      billion dog years  but an infinite number of years into the future. Meanwhile  for all intents and purposes  space looks finite to us. Space may be finite or infinite  but because the universe is accelerating  there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see. There's a finite region of space that we have access to  surrounded by a horizon. So even though time goes on forever  space is limited to us. Finally  empty space has a temperature. In the     s  Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole  even though you think it's black  it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics. The curvature of space time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation  and the black hole radiates. A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space  then the whole universe radiates. The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations. And so even though the universe will last forever  and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away  there will always be some radiation  some thermal fluctuations  even in empty space. So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever. Well what is the implication of that  That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the   th century. He said  well  entropy increases because there are many  many more ways for the universe to be high entropy  rather than low entropy. But that's a probabilistic statement. It will probably increase  and the probability is enormously huge. It's not something you have to worry about    the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us. It's very  very unlikely. Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever  that would happen. Everything that is allowed  every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room  would eventually be obtained. So Boltzmann says  look  you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium. He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe. He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton    they were absolute  they just stuck there forever. So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere    the everything molecules. But if you're Boltzmann  you know that if you wait long enough  the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations. And then  of course  in the natural course of things  they will expand back. So it's not that entropy must always increase    you can get fluctuations into lower entropy  more organized situations. Well if that's true  Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern sounding ideas    the multiverse and the anthropic principle. He says  the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can't live there. Remember  life itself depends on the arrow of time. We would not be able to process information  metabolize  walk and talk  if we lived in thermal equilibrium. So if you imagine a very  very big universe  an infinitely big universe  with randomly bumping into each other particles  there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states  and then they relax back. But there will also be large fluctuations. Occasionally  you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies. So Boltzmann says  we will only live in the part of the multiverse  in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles  where life is possible. That's the region where entropy is low. Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. Now your homework assignment is to really think about this  to contemplate what it means. Carl Sagan once famously said that  in order to make an apple pie  you must first invent the universe.  But he was not right. In Boltzmann's scenario  if you want to make an apple pie  you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie. That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven  and then making you an apple pie. So this scenario makes predictions. And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal. Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are  and we have  not only our memories  but our impression that outside there's something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy  it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech  the United States and the galaxy. The good news is that  therefore  this scenario does not work  it is not right. This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation. Even if you left our galaxy out  you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies. And Feynman also understood this. Feynman says   From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation  all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before  we will find it mixed up  and not like the piece we've just looked at    high entropy. If our order were due to a fluctuation  we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it. We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation.  So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer  If the universe is not a fluctuation  why did the early universe have a low entropy  And I would love to tell you the answer  but I'm running out of time. Here is the universe that we tell you about  versus the universe that really exists. I just showed you this picture. The universe is expanding for the last    billion years or so. It's cooling off. But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more. If the dark energy remains around  the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel  they will stop burning. They will fall into black holes. We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes. That universe will last    to the     years    a lot longer than our little universe has lived. The future is much longer than the past. But even black holes don't last forever. They will evaporate  and we will be left with nothing but empty space. That empty space lasts essentially forever. However  you notice  since empty space gives off radiation  there's actually thermal fluctuations  and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space. So even though the universe lasts forever  there's only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe. They all happen over a period of time equal to    to the    to the     years. So here's two questions for you. Number one  If the universe lasts for    to the    to the     years  why are we born in the first    billion years of it  in the warm  comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang  Why aren't we in empty space  You might say   Well there's nothing there to be living   but that's not right. You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness. Why aren't you  More homework assignment for you. So like I said  I don't actually know the answer. I'm going to give you my favorite scenario. Either it's just like that. There is no explanation. This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions. Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. An egg  an unbroken egg  is a low entropy configuration  and yet  when we open our refrigerator  we do not go   Hah  how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator.  That's because an egg is not a closed system  it comes out of a chicken. Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. Maybe there is something that naturally  through the growth of the laws of physics  gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations. If that's true  it would happen more than once  we would be part of a much bigger multiverse. That's my favorite scenario. So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation. My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history. And    years from now  all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities. We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse. And even better  we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations. This is a prediction. I might be wrong. But we've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like  why it came to be in the way it did for many  many years. It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday. Thank you. It's great being here at TED. You know  I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head  but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. The little things in life  sometimes that we forget about  like pollination  that we take for granted. And you can't tell the story about pollinators    bees  bats  hummingbirds  butterflies    without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co evolved over    million years. I've been filming time lapse flowers    hours a day  seven days a week  for over    years. To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of. It fills me with wonder  and it opens my heart. Beauty and seduction  I believe  is nature's tool for survival  because we will protect what we fall in love with. Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. It reminds us that we are a part of nature  and we're not separate from it. When I heard about the vanishing bees  Colony Collapse Disorder  it motivated me to take action. We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat. And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind. It's like the canary in the coalmine. If they disappear  so do we. It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers   What motivates the pollinators   Well  their answer was   It's all about risk and reward.  Like a wide eyed kid  I'd say   Why is that   And they'd say   Well  because they want to survive.  I go   Why    Well  in order to reproduce.   Well  why   And I thought that they'd probably say   Well  it's all about sex.  And Chip Taylor  our monarch butterfly expert  he replied   Nothing lasts forever. Everything in the universe wears out.  And that blew my mind. Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward  as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life. Rarely seen by the naked eye  this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment. It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself  over and over again. So here is some nectar from my film. I hope you'll drink  tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden. And always take time to smell the flowers  and let it fill you with beauty  and rediscover that sense of wonder. Here are some images from the film. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. My journey to become a polar specialist  photographing  specializing in the polar regions  began when I was four years old  when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island  up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of     Inuit people  where  we  were one of three non Inuit families. And in this community  we didn't have a television  we didn't have computers  obviously  radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit  playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox  and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you  for just two minutes only  some images  a cross section of my work  to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile   Have You Ever.  I don't know why National Geographic has done this  they've never done this before  but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this  so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are    you'll see them at the start of the slide show    there's only about four images    but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white  but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear  or a Kermode bear. There are only     of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought  my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking  So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life  after I was a photographer  because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine  they remind us all the time  they publish pictures  not excuses. And after two months of sitting there    one day  thinking that it was all over  this incredible big white male came down  right beside me  three feet away from me  and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old growth forest and sat up beside this     year old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him  just in the forest  and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy. Brandi Carlile    Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods      And everything there feels just as it should     You're part of the life there     You're part of something good     If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods     Have you ever stared into a starry sky      Lying on your back  you're asking why     What's the purpose      I wonder  who am I      If you've ever stared into a starry sky     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     Aah  ah  aah     Ah  oh  oh  ah  ah  oh  oh     Have you ever stared into a starry sky      Have you ever been out walking in the snow      Tried to get back where you were before     You always end up     Not knowing where to go     If you've ever been out walking in the snow     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     Aah  ah  aah  ah  aah     Ah  ah  oh  ah  ah  oh  ah     Oh  ah  ah  ah     Ah  ah  oh  ah  ah  oh  oh     If you'd ever been out walking you would know   Paul Nicklen  Thank you very much. The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK  let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact  scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years  then they said    years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic  the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to    years. And what does that mean  After a while of reading this in the news  it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that  if we lose ice  we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears  they could become extinct in the next    to     years. And there's no better  sexier  more beautiful  charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal        lb. bearded seal    grabbed it  swam back and ate it. And he was so full  he was so happy and so fat eating this seal  that  as I approached him    about    feet away    to get this picture  his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate  he was so full    he probably had about     lbs of meat in his belly    and as he ate inside one side of his mouth  he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive  but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist    years ago  we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years  we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea  floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere  and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice  which is great for them  they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately     percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals  these are the  fatsicles  of the Arctic. These little  fat dumplings      pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice  and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi year ice that's    years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that  as this ice melts  these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's     ft.  we're on our safety lines  the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice  that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice  you have     species of microorganisms. And in the spring  when the sun returns to the ice  it forms the phytoplankton  grows under that ice  and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed  and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips  my face is frozen  I can't feel my hands  I can't feel my feet. And I've come up  and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions  it's so extreme that  when I go down  almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant  and I'm looking up at him  and I'm going   Woo. Woo. Woo.  Which means   Take my camera.  And he thinks I'm saying   Take my picture.  So we had this little communication breakdown. But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales  bowhead whales  and narwhals  and polar bears  and leopard seals today  but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole  just through that hole that you just saw  and I looked up under the underside of the ice  and I was dizzy  I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous    no rope  no safety line  the whole world is moving around me    and I thought   I'm in trouble.  But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice  giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic  right here. And when you have low  productivity in this  in ice  the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly  science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over     years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived     years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals  these majestic narwhals with their eight foot long ivory tusks  don't have to be here  they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe  catch a breath  because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright  my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed  I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful  I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals  since the time of Shackleton  have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in         a scientist was taken down and drowned  and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like   We knew they were vicious. We knew they were.  And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea  I want to go to Antarctica  get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake    find out if they really are these vicious animals  or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh  and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. As a species  as humans  we like to say penguins are really cute  therefore  leopard seals eat them  so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute  and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are    ft. long  a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get    tourists packed into a Zodiac  floating in these icy waters  and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink  they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing    it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean    it doesn't have hands    it's going to take a little bite  the boat pops  and off they go. So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage    isn't that beautiful    after five days of crossing the Drake Passage  we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden    Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat  and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice  he goes   That's a bloody big seal  ya.  And this seal is taking this penguin by the head  and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside out  so it can eat the meat off the bones  and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin  came under the boat  the Zodiac  starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down  and that's when Goran said to me   This is a good seal  ya. It's time for you to get in the water.  And I looked at Goran  and I said to him   Forget that.  But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter  F.  But he was right. He scolded me out  and said   This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses.  So I had such dry mouth    probably not as bad as now    but I had such  such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth  and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me  engulfed my whole camera    and her teeth are up here and down here    but Goran  before I had gotten in the water  had given me amazing advice. He said   If you get scared  you close your eyes  ya  and she'll go away.  So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes  and then the most amazing thing happened    she totally relaxed. She went off  she got a penguin. She stopped about    feet away from me  and she sat there with this penguin  the penguin's flapping  and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me  takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me  And after she did this four or five times  she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic  but I swear that she looked at me like   This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean.  So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins  she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me  bobbing like this  and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding  because I was crying underwater  just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this.  Laughter  And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones  so she brought me dead penguins. Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head  and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like   Are you for real   Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world  you're either breeding or you're eating    and I'm not breeding  so ... And then that wasn't enough  she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force feed my camera  which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated  she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would  I think  let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far  I got nervous because she came up to me  she rolled over on her back  and she did this deep  guttural jackhammer sound  this gok gok gok gok. And I thought  she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me  and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away  went and got its penguin and brought it to me. That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with    other leopard seals  and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with  and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears  these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart  and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic  I'll take you  let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm thrilled to be here. I'm going to talk about a new  old material that still continues to amaze us  and that might impact the way we think about material science  high technology    and maybe  along the way  also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation. So that's kind of a bold statement. I'll tell you a little bit more. This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true. It's sustainable  it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature    and is biodegradable with a clock  so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years. It's edible  it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response. It actually gets reintegrated in the body. And it's technological  so it can do things like microelectronics  and maybe photonics do. And the material looks something like this. In fact  this material you see is clear and transparent. The components of this material are just water and protein. So this material is silk. So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk. So the question is  how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia  The process of discovery  generally  is inspired by nature. And so we marvel at silk worms    the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber. The silk worm does a remarkable thing  it uses these two ingredients  protein and water  that are in its gland  to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection    so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar. And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about  and that we're familiar with  for the textile industry  the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things. We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar  to this natural Kevlar. So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material. And this is an insight that came  about two decades ago  from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with  David Kaplan. And so we get this starting material. And so this starting material is back to the basic building block. And then we use this to do a variety of things    like  for example  this film. And we take advantage of something that is very simple. The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do. They find their way to self assemble. So the recipe is simple  you take the silk solution  you pour it  and you wait for the protein to self assemble. And then you detach the protein and you get this film  as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates. But I mentioned that the film is also technological. And so what does that mean  It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology  like microelectronics and nanoscale technology. And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface  which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale. So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD. And we can store information that's film with water and protein. So we tried something out  and we wrote a message in a piece of silk  which is right here  and the message is over there. And much like in the DVD  you can read it out optically. And this requires a stable hand  so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people. So let me see. So as you see the film go in transparently through there  and then ... And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that. So once you have these attributes of this material  then you can do a lot of things. It's actually not limited to films. And so the material can assume a lot of formats. And then you go a little crazy  and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays  like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes. Or you can do beautiful things that  if the camera can capture  you can make. You can add a third dimensionality to the film. And if the angle is right  you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk. But you can do other things. You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light  and so we've made optical fibers. But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics. And you can think of different formats. So for instance  if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle  we do microneedle arrays. What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that's made of silk    just to give you a sense of size. You can do bigger things. You can do gears and nuts and bolts    that you can buy at Whole Foods. And the gears work in water as well. So you think of alternative mechanical parts. And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins  for example  or maybe an entire bone. And so you have here a little example of a small skull    what we call mini Yorick. But you can do things like cups  for example  and so  if you add a little bit of gold  if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods. You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap. Or if you're fashion forward  some silk LED tattoos. So there's versatility  as you see  in the material formats  that you can do with silk. But there are still some unique traits. I mean  why would you want to do all these things for real  I mentioned it briefly at the beginning  the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible. And you see here a picture of a tissue section. And so what does that mean  that it's biodegradable and biocompatible  You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted. Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats  in principle  can be implanted and disappear. And what you see there in that tissue section  in fact  is you see that reflector tape. So  much like you're seen at night by a car  then the idea is that you can see  if you illuminate tissue  you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk. And you see there  it gets reintegrated in tissue. And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing  but reintegration in the environment is important. So you have a clock  you have protein  and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt    unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday. It's edible  so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food. It doesn't taste good  so I'm going to need some help with that. But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle. Silk  during its self assembly process  acts like a cocoon for biological matter. And so if you change the recipe  and you add things when you pour    so you add things to your liquid silk solution    where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines  the self assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants. So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive. So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together    a fractured bone together    and deliver drugs at the same  while your bone is healing  for example. Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge. So we've made a silk card with penicillin in it. And we stored penicillin at    degrees C  so     degrees Fahrenheit  for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin. And so that could be     that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels.  Laughter  And of course  there's no use in storage if you can't use  it . And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have  that they're programmably degradable. And so what you see there is the difference. In the top  you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade  and in the bottom  a film that has been programmed to degrade in water. And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it. So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before. And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you've seen. So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread. We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do  whether you want to replace a vein or a bone  or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics  perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt  maybe carry your drugs in your pocket  deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert  the answer may be in a thread of silk. Thank you. When I was a child  I always wanted to be a superhero. I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy. But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true. So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton  which was a lot of fun  but didn't yield much result. When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers  I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science  to find a more useful truth. I started my journey in California  with a UC Berkeley    year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook  and tried to measure their success and well being throughout their life. By measuring the students' smiles  researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long lasting a subject's marriage would be  how well she would score on standardized tests of well being  and how inspiring she would be to others. In another yearbook  I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture. When I first saw his picture  I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar. But now I know it was all in his smile. Another aha  moment came from a      Wayne State University research project that looked into pre     s baseball cards of Major League players. The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life. Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only   .  years  where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost    years. The good news is that we're actually born smiling. Using  D ultrasound technology  we can now see that developing babies appear to smile  even in the womb. When they're born  babies continue to smile    initially  mostly in their sleep. And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice. Smiling is one of the most basic  biologically uniform expressions of all humans. In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea  Paul Ekman  the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions  found that even members of the Fore tribe  who were completely disconnected from Western culture  and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals  attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would. So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing  we smile often  and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction. How many people here in this room smile more than    times per day  Raise your hand if you do. Oh  wow. Outside of this room  more than a third of us smile more than    times per day  whereas less than    percent of us smile less than five. In fact  those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children  who smile as many as     times per day. Have you ever wondered why being around children  who smile so frequently  makes you smile very often  A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles. You ask why  Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious  and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles. Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real  so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler. In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont Ferrand in France  subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles. Without the pencil  subjects were excellent judges  but with the pencil in their mouth    when they could not mimic the smile they saw    their judgment was impaired. In addition to theorizing on evolution in  The Origin of Species   Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory. His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better  rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good. In his study  Darwin actually cited a French neurologist  Guillaume Duchenne  who sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles. Please  don't try this at home. In a related German study  researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles. The finding supported Darwin's theory  by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain  in a way that helps us feel better when we smile. Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate    a well regarded pleasure inducer    cannot match. British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to       bars of chocolate. Wait    The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to        pounds sterling in cash. That's like    grand a smile. It's not bad. And think about it this way         times        quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day. And unlike lots of chocolate  lots of smiling can actually make you healthier. Smiling can help reduce the level of stress enhancing hormones like cortisol  adrenaline and dopamine  increase the level of mood enhancing hormones like endorphins  and reduce overall blood pressure. And if that's not enough  smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others. A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile  you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous  but you actually appear to be more competent. So whenever you want to look great and competent  reduce your stress or improve your marriage  or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost  or as if you found    grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages  or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer  healthier  happier life  smile. My name is Amit. And    months ago  I had another job at Google  and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here  and she allowed me to do it. And it took    months. A lot of fun  negotiations and stories  I can tell you  with    very interesting museums from nine countries. But I'm going to focus on the demo. There are a lot of stories about why we did this. I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide  and it's access. And I grew up in India. I had a great education    I'm not complaining    but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks. And so when I started traveling and going to these museums  I started learning a lot. And while working at Google  I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together. So we formed a team  a great team of people  and we started doing this. I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch. So  simple  you come to GoogleArtProject.com. You look around at all these museums here. You've got the Uffizi  you've got the MoMA  the Hermitage  the Rijks  the Van Gogh. I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites  the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Two ways of going in    very simple. Click and  bang  you're in this museum. It doesn't matter where you are    Bombay  Mexico  it doesn't really matter. You move around  you have fun. You want to navigate around the museum  Open the plan up  and  in one click  jump. You're in there  you want to go to the end of the corridor. Keep going. Have fun. Explore. Thanks. I haven't come to the best part. So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings   The Harvesters  by Pieter Bruegel at the Met. I see this plus sign. If the museum has given us the image  you click on it. Now this is one of the images. So this is all of the meta data information. For those of you who are truly interested in art  you can click this    but I'm going to click this off right now. And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology. So this image  for example  has close to  I think  around    billion pixels. And I get a lot of people asking me   What do you get for    billion pixels   So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for    billion pixels. You can zoom around very simply. You see some fun stuff happening here. I love this guy  his expression is priceless. But then you really want to go deep. And so I started playing around  and I found something going on over here. And I was like   Hold on. That sounds interesting.  Went in  and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something. I did a little research  spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met  and actually found out that this is a game called squall  which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday. And apparently it was quite popular. I don't know why they did it  but I learned something about it. Now just to get really deep in  you can really get to the cracks. Now just to give you some perspective  I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get. Here is where we were  and this is the painting. The best is yet to come    so in a second. So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA  again in New York. So another one of my favorites   The Starry Night.  Now the example I showed you was all about finding details. But what if you want to see brush strokes  And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece  You zoom in. You really go in. I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting  and I'm really going to get to the cracks. This is  The Starry Night   I think  never seen like this before. I'm going to show you my other favorite feature. There's a lot of other stuff here  but I don't have time. This is the real cool part. It's called Collections. Any one of you  anybody    doesn't matter if you're rich  if you're poor  if you have a fancy house    doesn't matter. You can go and create your own museum online    create your own collection across all these images. Very simply  you go in    and I've created this  called The Power of Zoom    you can just zoom around. This is  The Ambassadors   based in the National Gallery. You can annotate the stuff  send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. So I think  in conclusion  for me  the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google. It doesn't  in my opinion  even come from the museums. I probably shouldn't say that. It really comes from these artists. And that's been my humbling experience in this. I mean  I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online. And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is   Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum   And the answer is no. It's to supplement the experience. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you. I decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend Richard Feynman. I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence. And I'm going to tell you the Richard Feynman that I knew. I'm sure there are other people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew  and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman. Richard Feynman was a very complex man. He was a man of many  many parts. He was  of course  foremost  a very  very  very great scientist. He was an actor. You saw him act. I also had the good fortune to be in those lectures  up in the balcony. They were fantastic. He was a philosopher  he was a drum player  he was a teacher par excellence. Richard Feynman was also a showman  an enormous showman. He was brash  irreverent    he was full of macho  a kind of macho one upmanship. He loved intellectual battle. He had a gargantuan ego. But the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom. And what I mean by that is a lot of room  in my case    I can't speak for anybody else    but in my case  a lot of room for another big ego. Well  not as big as his  but fairly big. I always felt good with Dick Feynman. It was always fun to be with him. He always made me feel smart. How can somebody like that make you feel smart  Somehow he did. He made me feel smart. He made me feel he was smart. He made me feel we were both smart  and the two of us could solve any problem whatever. And in fact  we did sometimes do physics together. We never published a paper together  but we did have a lot of fun. He loved to win. With these little macho games we would sometimes play    and he didn't only play them with me  he played them with all sorts of people    he would almost always win. But when he didn't win  when he lost  he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won. I remember once he told me a story about a joke that the students played on him. They took him    I think it was for his birthday    they took him for lunch. They took him for lunch to a sandwich place in Pasadena. It may still exist  I don't know. Celebrity sandwiches was their thing. You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich. You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich. The students went there in advance  and they arranged that they would all order Feynman sandwiches. One after another  they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches. Feynman loved this story. He told me this story  and he was really happy and laughing. When he finished the story  I said to him   Dick  I wonder what would be the difference between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich.  And without skipping a beat at all  he said   Well  they'd be about the same. The only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham   ham  as in bad actor. Well  I happened to have been very quick that day  and I said   Yeah  but a lot less baloney.  The truth of the matter is that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham  but absolutely no baloney. What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense    phoniness  false sophistication  jargon. I remember sometime during the '  s  the mid '  s  Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco at some very rich guy's house    up in San Francisco for dinner. And the last time the rich guy invited us  he also invited a couple of philosophers. These guys were philosophers of mind. Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness. And they were full of all kinds of jargon. I'm trying to remember the words     monism    dualism   categories all over the place. I didn't know what those things meant  neither did Dick    neither did Sydney for that matter. And what did we talk about  Well  what do you talk about when you talk about minds  One thing  there's one obvious thing to talk about    can a machine become a mind  Can you build a machine that thinks like a human being  that is conscious  We sat around and we talked about this    we of course never resolved it. But the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been science iphizing. It's a scientific question after all. And this was a very  very dangerous thing to do around Dick Feynman. Feynman let them have it    both barrels  right between the eyes. It was brutal  it was funny    ooh  it was funny. But it was really brutal. He really popped their balloon. But the amazing thing was    Feynman had to leave a little early. He wasn't feeling too well  so he left a little bit early. And Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers. And the amazing thing is these guys were flying. They were so happy. They had met the great man  they had been instructed by the great man  they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud  and it was something special. I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman  even when he did what he did. Dick  he was my friend. I did call him Dick. Dick and I had a certain  a little bit of a rapport. I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had. We liked each other  we liked the same kind of things. I also liked the kind of intellectual macho games. Sometimes I would win  mostly he would win  but we both enjoyed them. And Dick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality. I don't think he was right. I think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves. But he was convinced of this. And he was curious. The man was incredibly curious. And he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection. And one day we were walking. We were in France. We were in Les Houches. We were up in the mountains      . We were up in the mountains  and Feynman said to me  he said   Leonardo.  The reason he called me Leonardo is because we were in Europe and he was practicing his French. And he said   Leonardo  were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid   And I said   Well  my real hero was my father. He was a working man  had a fifth grade education. He was a master mechanic  and he taught me how to use tools. He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things. He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem. He didn't call it the hypotenuse  he called it the shortcut distance.  And Feynman's eyes just opened up. He went off like a light bulb. And he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father. In fact  he had been convinced at one time that  to be a good physicist  that it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father. I apologize for the sexist conversation here  but this is the way it really happened. He said that he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary    the necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist. Being Dick  he  of course  wanted to check this. He wanted to go out and do an experiment. So  well he did. He went out and did an experiment. He asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists   Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you   And to a man    they were all men    to a man  every single one of them said   My mother.  There went that theory down the trashcan of history. But he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father. And for some time  he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well. I don't know. Maybe. Who knows  But let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist. Feynman's style    no  style is not the right word. Style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing. There's something much deeper than that  but I can't think of another word for it. Feynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest  most elementary solution to a problem that was possible. If it wasn't possible  you had to use something fancier. But no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could. But he also deeply believed  he truly believed  that if you couldn't explain something simply you didn't understand it. In the     s  people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked. There was a theory. It was due to a Russian mathematical physicist  and it was a complicated theory. I'll tell you what that theory was soon enough. It was a terribly complicated theory full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth. And it sort of worked  but it didn't work very well. The only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very  very far apart. The helium atoms had to be very far apart. And unfortunately  the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other. Feynman decided  as a sort of amateur helium physicist  that he would try to figure it out. He had an idea  a very clear idea. He would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like. He would try to visualize it  guided by a small number of simple principles. The small number of simple principles were very  very simple. The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other  they repel. The implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero  it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other. The other fact is that the ground state  the lowest energy state of a quantum system  the wave function is always very smooth    has the minimum number of wiggles. So he sat down    and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil    and he tried to write down  and did write down  the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between. He wrote down a simple thing. It was so simple  in fact  that I suspect a really smart high school student  who didn't even have calculus  could understand what he wrote down. The thing was that that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some. I've always wondered whether the professionals  the real professional helium physicists  were just a little bit embarrassed by this. They had their super powerful technique  and they couldn't do as well. Incidentally  I'll tell you what that super powerful technique was. It was the technique of Feynman diagrams. He did it again in     . In       in my own university    I wasn't there at the time    but in       they were exploring the structure of the proton. The proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles. This was more or less known. And the way to analyze it was  of course  Feynman diagrams. That's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for    to understand particles. The experiments that were going on were very simple. You simply take the proton  and you hit it really sharply with an electron. This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for. The only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated. They're difficult integrals. If you could do all of them  you would have a very precise theory. But you couldn't  they were just too complicated. People were trying to do them. You could do a one loop diagram. Don't worry about one loop. One loop  two loops    maybe you could do a three loop diagram  but beyond that  you couldn't do anything. Feynman said   Forget all of that. Just think of the proton as an assemblage of little particles    a swarm of little particles.  He called them partons. He called them partons. He said   Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast.  Because they're moving real fast  relativity says the internal motions go very slow. The electron hits it suddenly. It's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton. What do you see  You see a frozen bunch of partons. They don't move  and because they don't move during the course of the experiment  you don't have to worry about how they're moving. You don't have to worry about the forces between them. You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons. This was the key to analyzing these experiments. Extremely effective  it really did    somebody said the word revolution is a bad word. I suppose it is  so I won't say revolution    but it certainly evolved very  very deeply our understanding of the proton  and of particles beyond that. Well  I had some more that I was going to tell you about my connection with Feynman  what he was like  but I see I have exactly half a minute. So I think I'll just finish up by saying I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event. I think he would have said   I don't need this.  But how should we honor Feynman  How should we really honor Feynman  I think the answer is we should honor Feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can. Thank you. Think about your day for a second. You woke up  felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door  encountered new colleagues and had great discussions  and felt in awe when you found something new. But I bet there's something you didn't think about today    something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all. And that's that all the sensations  feelings  decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain. Now the brain may not look like much from the outside    a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh  amorphous    but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain  and to see the intricacy of what lies within. And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons. Now unlike a human designed computer  where there's a fairly small number of different parts    we know how they work  because we humans designed them    the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells  maybe tens of thousands. They come in different shapes  they're made out of different molecules. And they project and connect to different brain regions  and they also change different ways in different disease states. Let's make it concrete. There's a class of cells  a fairly small cell  an inhibitory cell  that quiets its neighbors. It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia. It's called the basket cell. And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about. New ones are being discovered everyday. As just a second example  these pyramidal cells  large cells  they can span a significant fraction of the brain. They're excitatory. And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy. Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device. They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs  which then  if they pass a certain threshold  will go to thousands of downstream partners. And this process  which takes just a millisecond or so  happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your     billion cells  as long as you live and think and feel. So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does  Ideally  we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies. If we could activate cells  we could see what powers they can unleash  what they can initiate and sustain. If we could turn them off  then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for. And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today. And honestly  where we've gone through over the last    years  through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off  both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans. Now before I tell you about the technology  the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room  if we live long enough  will encounter  perhaps  a brain disorder. Already  a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them  and the numbers don't do it justice though. These disorders    schizophrenia  Alzheimer's  depression  addiction    they not only steal our time to live  they change who we are. They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people. Now in the   th century  there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders  and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders  practically none of them can be considered to be cured. And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical. This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance. That's also why  perhaps  most of the drugs  and not all  on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too. Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain. And for Parkinson's disease  Cochlear implants  these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder. But electricity also will go in all directions    the path of least resistance  which is where that phrase  in part  comes from. And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix. So again  we're sent back to the idea of ultra precise control. Could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go  So when I started in neuroscience    years ago  I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist  and the first thing I thought about was  if these neurons are electrical devices  all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance. If we could turn on the electricity in one cell  but not its neighbors  that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells  figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded. And also it would allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry. Now how are we going to do that  Well there are many molecules that exist in nature  which are able to convert light into electricity. You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells. If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow  then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light. And their neighbors  which don't have the molecule  would not. There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen  and that's the ability to get light into the brain. And to do that    the brain doesn't feel pain    you can put    taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on    optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate  in animal models for example  in pre clinical studies  these neurons and to see what they do. So how do we do this  Around       in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth  this vision came to fruition. There's a certain alga that swims in the wild  and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally. And it senses light with a little eye spot  which works not unlike how our eye works. In its membrane  or its boundary  it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity. So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins. And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about. When blue light hits it  it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye spot  and that allows this eye spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery. So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons. And because it's a protein  it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism. So all we've got to do is take that DNA  put it into a gene therapy vector  like a virus  and put it into neurons. So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy  and lots of viruses were coming along. So this turned out to be very simple to do. And early in the morning one day in the summer of       we gave it a try  and it worked on the first try. You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron. The neuron uses its natural protein making machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell  like putting solar panels on a roof  and the next thing you know  you have a neuron which can be activated with light. So this is very powerful. One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors. And you can do that  you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others. And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells. This field has now come to be known as optogenetics. And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do  you can take a complex network  use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network. And then when you shine light on the entire network  just that cell type will be activated. So for example  lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier    the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory. If we can deliver that gene to these cells    and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene  of course    and then flash blue light over the entire brain network  just these cells are going to be driven. And when the light turns off  these cells go back to normal  so they don't seem to be averse against that. Not only can you use this to study what these cells do  what their power is in computing in the brain  but you can also use this to try to figure out    well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells  if indeed they're atrophied. Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we're using this  both at the scientific  clinical and pre clinical levels. One of the questions we've confronted is  what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward  Because if you could find those  those would be some of the signals that could drive learning. The brain will do more of whatever got that reward. And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction. So if we could figure out what cells they are  we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against  or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability. So to do that  we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group  where one side of this little box  if the animal goes there  the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light. So if these cells can mediate reward  the animal should go there more and more. And so that's what happens. This animal's going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there  and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that. And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times. These are the dopamine neurons  which some of you may have heard about  in some of the pleasure centers in the brain. Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough  indeed  to drive learning. Now we can generalize the idea. Instead of one point in the brain  we can devise devices that span the brain  that can deliver light into three dimensional patterns    arrays of optical fibers  each coupled to its own independent miniature light source. And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish    like high throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen. Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders. And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post traumatic stress disorder    a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear. And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear. This goes back to the Pavlovian days. It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning    where a tone ends with a brief shock. The shock isn't painful  but it's a little annoying. And over time    in this case  a mouse  which is a good animal model  commonly used in such experiments    the animal learns to fear the tone. The animal will react by freezing  sort of like a deer in the headlights. Now the question is  what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear  So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear. But we activate targets in the brain  different ones  using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide  in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear. And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now. This is an area in the prefrontal cortex  a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states. And the animal's going to hear a tone    and a flash of light occurred there. There's no audio on this  but you can see the animal's freezing. This tone used to mean bad news. And there's a little clock in the lower left hand corner  so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this. And now this next clip is just eight minutes later. And the same tone is going to play  and the light is going to flash again. Okay  there it goes. Right now. And now you can see  just    minutes into the experiment  that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory. Now over the last couple of years  we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off. If we could do that  this could be extremely powerful. If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds  you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded. And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life    every kingdom of life except for animals  we see slightly differently. And we found all sorts of molecules  they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins  that respond to green and yellow light. And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin. Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go. Consider  for example  a condition like epilepsy  where the brain is overactive. Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment  one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain. But that's obviously irreversible  and there could be side effects. What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time  until the seizure dies away  and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state    sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state. So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light  and we beam light in  and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure  we're hoping to be able to turn it off. And so we don't have data to show you on this front  but we're very excited about this. Now I want to close on one story  which we think is another possibility    which is that maybe these molecules  if you can do ultra precise control  can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic  an optical prosthetic. I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon. Seventy five thousand people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted. Maybe         people have Cochlear implants  which allow them to hear. There's another thing  which is you've got to get these genes into cells. And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno associated virus  which probably most of us around this room have  and it doesn't have any symptoms  which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body. And so far  there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus. There's one last elephant in the room  the proteins themselves  which come from algae and bacteria and fungi  and all over the tree of life. Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains  so what is our brain going to do if we put that in  Are the cells going to tolerate it  Will the immune system react  In its early days    these have not been done on humans yet    but we're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this  and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light. So it's early days  to be upfront  but we're excited about it. I wanted to close with one story  which we think could potentially be a clinical application. Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors  our light sensors that are in the back of our eye  are gone. And the retina  of course  is a complex structure. Now let's zoom in on it here  so we can see it in more detail. The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top  and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom  the ganglion cells  relay the information to the brain  where we see that as perception. In many forms of blindness  like retinitis pigmentosa  or macular degeneration  the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed. Now how could you repair this  It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored  because there's nothing for the drug to bind to. On the other hand  light can still get into the eye. The eye is still transparent and you can get light in. So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras. And because there's so many of these cells in the eye  potentially  they could be very high resolution cameras. So this is some work that we're doing. It's being led by one of our collaborators  Alan Horsager at USC  and being sought to be commercialized by a start up company Eos Neuroscience  which is funded by the NIH. And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze. It's a six arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move  or he'll just sit there. And the goal  of course  of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port. Now mice are smart  so this mouse solves the maze eventually  but he does a brute force search. He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform. So he's not using vision to do it. These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans. And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach. So how are we going to solve this  We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide. We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera    just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive. Light is converted to electricity on them. So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus. And now you can see  the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again. And to point out the power of this  these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives. So this pre clinical study  I think  bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future. To close  I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology. We're developing these tools  but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world  so people can study and try to treat different disorders. And our hope is that  by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them  we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier  practically none of which are cured  and in the   st century make them history. Thank you. Juan Enriquez  So some of the stuff is a little dense. But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs  and being able to target those specifically is a first step. The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors  like an on off switch. Ed Boyden  That's right. JE  Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code. EB  Right  yeah. So with blue light  we can drive information  and it's in the form of a one. And by turning things off  it's more or less a zero. So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities. JE  And in theory  that means that  as a mouse feels  smells  hears  touches  you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros. EB  Sure  yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings  and use that to understand more about the brain. JE  Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them  EB  Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard. We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too. So we can record information and then drive information back in    sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing. JE  Well  that might change a couple things. Thank you.  EB  Thank you.  Hello  my name is Thomas Heatherwick. I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings. When I was growing up  I was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale. And I was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications I was seeing felt soulless and cold. And there on the smaller scale  the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument  was a materiality and a soulfulness. And this influenced me. The first building I built was    years ago. And since  in the last    years  I've developed a studio in London. Sorry  this was my mother  by the way  in her bead shop in London. I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that. I'm just going to show  for people who don't know my studio's work  a few projects that we've worked on. This is a hospital building. This is a shop for a bag company. This is studios for artists. This is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and         glass beads the size of a golf ball. And this is a window display. And this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London. And this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk. And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain. And just very quickly  something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again. Because the original Routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with  which had this open platform at the back    in fact  I think all our Routemasters are here in California now actually. But they aren't in London. And so you're stuck on a bus. And if the bus is going to stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop  you're just a prisoner. But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform. So we've been working with Transport for London  and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for    years. And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work. The brief is that the bus should use    percent less energy. So it's got hybrid drive. And we've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics. I was going to show four main projects. And this is a project for a bridge. And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open. And openings seemed    everyone loves opening bridges  but it's quite a basic thing. I think we all kind of stand and watch. But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed    I'm slightly squeamish    but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball. And as he was diving  someone had stamped on his knee  and it had broken like this. And then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken. And so this is in Paddington in London. And it's a very boring bridge  as you can see. It's just steel and timber. But instead of what it is  our focus was on the way it worked. So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other. We actually had to halve its speed  because everyone was too scared when we first did it. So that's it speeded up. A project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station    so a power station that uses organic waste material. In the news  the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time. And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power. But recently  any annual report of a power company doesn't have a power station on it. It has a child running through a field  or something like that. And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station  our condition was that we would work with them and that  whatever we did  we were not just going to decorate a normal power station. And instead  we had to learn    we kind of forced them to teach us. And so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements  and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on. That just taking a field and banging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work. So we looked at how we could compose all those elements    instead of just litter  create one composition. And what we found    this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain. It was voted the worst place in Britain to live. And there are       new homes being built next to this power station. So it felt this has a social dimension. It has a symbolic importance. And we should be proud of where our power is coming from  rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of. So we were looking at how we could make a power station  that  instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside  could be a place that pulls you in. And it has to be    I'm trying to get my        feet high. So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in  and using the spare soil that's there on the site  we could make a power station that was silent as well. Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference. And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost effective way of making a structure to do this. The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station. It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top. And it's a power park. So people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area  and use that height that we have to have for its function. In Shanghai  we were invited to build    well we weren't invited  what am I talking about. We won the competition  and it was painful to get there. So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion. And an expo is a totally bonkers thing. There's     pavilions. It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened. So there are up to a million people there everyday. And     countries all competing. And the British government saying   You need to be in the top five.  And so that became the governmental goal    is  how do you stand out in this chaos  which is an expo of stimulus  So our sense was we had to do one thing  and only one thing  instead of trying to have everything. And so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain. But the thing that was true  the expo was about the future of cities  and particularly the Victorians pioneered integrating nature into the cities. And the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain. And the world's first major botanical institution is in London  and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting    percent of all the world's plant species. So we suddenly realized that there was this thing. And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful  and I've never met anyone who says   I don't like trees.  And the same with flowers. I've never met anyone who says   I don't like flowers.  But we realized that seeds    there's been this very serious project happening    but that seeds    at these major botanical gardens  seeds aren't on show. But you just have to go to a garden center  and they're in little paper packets. But this phenomenal project's been happening. So we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds  some kind of seed cathedral. But how could we show these teeny weeny things  And the film  Jurassic Park  actually really helped us. Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious  rather than looking like nuts. So the challenge was  how are we going to bring light and expose these things  We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content. So we were trying to think  how could we make a whole thing emanate. By the way  we had half the budget of the other Western nations. So that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch. And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue. Song    We've got the Mop Tops  the Play Doh Mop Tops     Just turn the chair and grow Play Doh hair     They're the Mop Tops   Thomas Heatherwick  Okay  you get the idea. So the idea was to take these        seeds that they agreed to give us  and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box  very simple box element  and make it a building that could move in the wind. So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows. And inside  the daylight    each one is an optic and it brings light into the center. And by night  artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside. And to make the project affordable  we focused our energy. Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch  we focused it on this one element. And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else  and focus our energy on that. And so the rest of the site was a public space. And with a million people there a day  it just felt like offering some public space. We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini me version of the seed cathedral  so that  even if you're partially sighted  that it was kind of crunchy and soft  that piece of landscape that you see there. And then  you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur    in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral  in effect  we've shaved it. And inside there's nothing  there's no famous actor's voice  there's no projections  there's no televisions  there's no color changing. There's just silence and a cool temperature. And if a cloud goes past  you can see a cloud on the tips where it's letting the light through. This is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings. A key thing was how people would interact. I mean  in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo. And I just wanted to show you. The British government    any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have. And there was a lot of terror. But there was an underlying support. And so there was a moment when suddenly    actually  the next thing. This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment  who was our client  with the Chinese children  using the landscape. TH  I'm sorry about my stupid voice there. So finally  texture is something. In the projects we've been working on  these slick buildings  where they might be a fancy shape  but the materiality feels the same  is something that we've been trying to research really  and explore alternatives. And the project that we're building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer. And it's in a piece of land that's this site. And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur said that  if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city  they would give them more gross floor area  buildable. So there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city. And the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower  and you squeeze a few trees around the edge  and you see cars parked. It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience  and the rest of it is just for postcards. The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this. So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom  we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer. And by linking these together  we could have    percent of the site as a rainforest  instead of only    percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings. So we're building these buildings. They're actually identical  so it's quite cost effective. They're just chopped at different heights. But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape  rather than engulf it. And that's my final slide. Thank you. Thank you. June Cohen  So thank you. Thank you  Thomas. You're a delight. Since we have an extra minute here  I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds  which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building. TH  These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure. So there were        of these. This optic was    feet long. And so the daylight was just coming    it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed. Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy. Because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway  but if you say you're going to drill        holes in it    we had quite a time. There was one person in the contractors who was the right size    and it wasn't a child    who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building. JC  Thank you  Thomas. I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist  so I put children to sleep for a living. And I'm an academic  so I put audiences to sleep for free. But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto. And it's from the experience from about    or    years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning  that pain is a disease. Now most of the time  you think of pain as a symptom of a disease  and that's true most of the time. It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation. But about    percent of the time  after the patient has recovered from one of those events  pain persists. It persists for months and oftentimes for years  and when that happens  it is its own disease. And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it  I want to show you how it feels for my patients. So imagine  if you will  that I'm stroking your arm with this feather  as I'm stroking my arm right now. Now  I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this. Please keep your seat. A very different feeling. Now what does it have to do with chronic pain  Imagine  if you will  these two ideas together. Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather  but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling    and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain. In fact  imagine something even worse. Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather  and their brain  was  telling them that they were feeling this hot torch. That was the experience of my patient  Chandler  whom you see in the photograph. As you can see  she's a beautiful  young woman. She was    years old last year when I met her  and she aspired to be a professional dancer. And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals  she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist. Now you would probably imagine  as she did  that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life. Wrap it in an ACE bandage  take some ibuprofen for a week or two  and that's the end of the story. But in Chandler's case  that was the beginning of the story. This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain. You can see that the arm is discolored  purplish in color. It was cadaverically cold to the touch. The muscles were frozen  paralyzed    dystonic is how we refer to that. The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands  to her fingertips  from her wrist up to her elbow  almost all the way to her shoulder. But the worst part was  not the spontaneous pain that was there    hours a day. The worst part was that she had allodynia  the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch. The lightest touch of her arm    the touch of a hand  the touch even of a sleeve  of a garment  as she put it on    caused excruciating  burning pain. How can the nervous system get this so wrong  How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame  Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. In your house  wires run in the wall  from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb. And when you turn the switch on  the light goes on. And when you turn the switch off  the light goes off. So people imagine the nervous system is just like that. If you hit your thumb with a hammer  these wires in your arm    that  of course  we call nerves    transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires  new nerves  take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt. But the situation  of course  in the human body is far more complicated than that. Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one on one fashion  in fact  what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions    laterally  vertically  up and down in the spinal cord    and they start interacting with other adjacent cells. These cells  called glial cells  were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together  like the nerves. But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation  amplification and  in the case of pain  the distortion of sensory experiences. These glial cells become activated. Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins  which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves  and they start releasing their neurotransmitters  and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells  and so on and so forth  until what we have is a positive feedback loop. It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch  the toilet flushed three doors down  or your dishwasher went on  or your computer monitor turned off. That's crazy  but that's  in fact  what happens with chronic pain. And that's why pain becomes its own disease. The nervous system has plasticity. It changes  and it morphs in response to stimuli. Well  what do we do about that  What can we do in a case like Chandler's  We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time. We treat them with symptom modifying drugs    painkillers    which are  frankly  not very effective for this kind of pain. We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet  and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics. And most importantly  what we do is we use a rigorous  and often uncomfortable  process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life. And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency  despair and depression that always accompanies severe  chronic pain. It's successful  as you can see from this video of Chandler  who  two months after we first met her  is now doings a back flip. And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here  and she's doing absolutely fantastic. But the future is actually even brighter. The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem  as we have now  but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells  or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate  that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up  or plasticity  that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain. So I have hope that in the future  the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized  who said   My philosophy  No pain  no pain.  Thank you very much. So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world. And it's not a trip that requires light years of travel  but it's to a place where it's defined by light. So it's a little appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light. I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence. I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs. I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution. But mostly I'm entranced by it. Since my my first dive in a deep diving submersible  when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays  I've been a bioluminescence junky. But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words  and they were totally inadequate to the task. I needed some way to share the experience directly. And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called Deep Rover. This next video clip  you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence. And the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across. a mess screen will come into contact with the soft bodied creatures of the deep sea. With the sub's lights switched off  it is possible to see their bioluminescence    the light produced when they collide with the mesh. This is the first time it has ever been recorded. Edith Widder  So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark adapted human eye. Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible. But just to try to prove that fact to you  I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration. So  if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible  I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it. And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now  either because they're dead    or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like. Oops. Sorry. I spend most of my time working in the dark  I'm used to that. Okay. So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate  a single celled alga. So why would a single celled alga need to be able to produce light  Well  it uses it to defend itself from its predators. The flash is like a scream for help. It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm  and just like the alarm on your car or your house  it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder  thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away. There's a lot of animals that use this trick  for example this black dragonfish. It's got a light organ under its eye. It's got a chin barbel. It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see  but you'll see in here in a minute. So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime  because the top speed of this fish is one knot  which was the top speed of the submersible. But it was worth it  because we caught it in a special capture device  brought it up into the lab on the ship  and then everything on this fish lights up. It's unbelievable. The light organs under the eyes are flashing. That chin barbel is flashing. It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing  fin lights. It's a scream for help  it's meant to attract attention. It's phenomenal. And you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets. There's other ways you can defend yourself with light. For example  this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud. This blinds or distracts the predator. This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this. Now it may look like a tasty morsel  or a pig's head with wings    but if it's attacked  it puts out a barrage of light    in fact  a barrage of photon torpedoes. I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing. It's phenomenal. So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean    most of them that make light. And we have a pretty good idea  for most of them  why. They use it for finding food  for attracting mates  for defending against predators. But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean  that's where things get really strange. And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in  Avatar   but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them. They're things like this. This is a golden coral  a bush. It grows very slowly. In fact  it's thought that some of these are as much as       years old  which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed. The other reason is this amazing bush glows. So if you brush up against it  any place you brushed against it  you get this twinkling blue green light that's just breathtaking. And you see things like this. This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book    just all manner of creatures all over this thing. And these are flytrap anemones. Now if you poke it  it pulls in its tentacles. But if you keep poking it  it starts to produce light. And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy. It produces these strings of light  presumably as some form of defense. There are starfish that can make light. And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms. This looks like a plant  but it's actually an animal. And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock. So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents  as you see here. But if we collect it very gently  and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock  it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume  changing color as it goes  from green to blue. Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure. But we have no idea why it does that. Here's another one. This is also a sea pen. It's got a brittle star hitching a ride. It's a green saber of light. And like the one you just saw  it can produce these as bands of light. So if I squeeze the base  the bands go from base to tip. If I squeeze the tip  they go from tip to base. So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle  I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about. So there's a language of light in the deep ocean  and we're just beginning to understand it  and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays. This is an optical lure that I've used. We call it the electronic jellyfish. It's just    blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays. And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye in the Sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals  so it's unobtrusive. So I just want to show you some of the responses we've elicited from animals in the deep sea. So the camera's black and white. It's not high resolution. And what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of    like the cockroaches of the ocean    there are isopods all over it. And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish. And when it starts flashing  it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast. But as soon as it starts to flash    and it's going to look big  because it blooms on the camera    I want you to look right here. There's something small there that responds. We're talking to something. It looks like a little of string pearls basically    in fact  three strings of pearls. And this was very consistent. This was in the Bahamas at about       feet. We basically have a chat room going on here  because once it gets started  everybody's talking. And I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water. But the cool thing is  we're talking to it. We don't know what we're saying. Personally  I think it's something sexy. And then finally  I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep sea webcam  which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year. We've only just begun to analyze all of this data. This is going to be a glowing source first  which is like bioluminescent bacteria. And it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean. So this scavenger comes in  which is a giant sixgill shark. And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in  because there's bait right there. But if it had been following the odor plume  it would have come in from the other direction. And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish. That's a    foot long giant sixgill shark. Okay  so this next one is from the webcam  and it's going to be this pinwheel display. And this is a burglar alarm. And that was a Humboldt squid  a juvenile Humboldt squid  about three feet long. This is at       feet in Monterey Canyon. But if it's a burglar alarm  you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly. It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish. But we did see a bunch of responses like this. This guy is a little more contemplative.  Hey  wait a minute. There's supposed to be something else there.  He's thinking about it. But he's persistent. He keeps coming back. And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more  and thinks   Maybe if I come in from a different angle.  Nope. So we are starting to get a handle on this  but only just the beginnings. We need more eyes on the process. So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible  by all means  climb in and take the plunge. This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list  because we live on an ocean planet. More than    percent     percent  of the living space on our planet is ocean. It's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures  alien life forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see. But if you do take the plunge  please remember to turn out the lights. But I warn you  it's addictive. Thank you. I'm used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective  intelligent  intellectual  savvy  worldly and innovative people in the world. And I think that's true. However  I also have reason to believe that many  if not most  of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly. Now I know that seems ludicrous. I know that seems ludicrous. And believe me  I lived the same sad life until about three years ago. And what happened to me was I bought  what was for me  a very expensive pair of shoes. But those shoes came with round nylon laces  and I couldn't keep them tied. So I went back to the store and said to the owner   I love the shoes  but I hate the laces.  He took a look and said   Oh  you're tying them wrong.  Now up until that moment  I would have thought that  by age     one of the life skills that I had really nailed was tying my shoes. But not so    let me demonstrate. This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes. Now as it turns out    thank you. Wait  there's more. As it turns out    there's a strong form and a weak form of this knot  and we were taught the weak form. And here's how to tell. If you pull the strands at the base of the knot  you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe. That's the weak form of the knot. But not to worry. If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow  we get this  the strong form of the knot. And if you pull the cords under the knot  you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe. This is a stronger knot. It will come untied less often. It will let you down less  and not only that  it looks better. We're going to do this one more time. Start as usual    go the other way around the loop. This is a little hard for children  but I think you can handle it. Pull the knot. There it is  the strong form of the shoe knot. Now  in keeping with today's theme  I'd like to point out    something you already know    that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else. Live long and prosper. So I think data can actually make us more human. We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives  and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories. Recently  a wise media theorist Tweeted   The   th century culture was defined by the novel  the   th century culture was defined by the cinema  and the culture of the   st century will be defined by the interface.  And I believe this is going to prove true. Our lives are being driven by data  and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories. So I'm going to show you a few of the projects that I've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems. This is a project called Flight Patterns. What you're looking at is airplane traffic over North America for a    hour period. As you see  everything starts to fade to black  and you see people going to sleep. Followed by that  you see on the West coast planes moving across  the red eye flights to the East coast. And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast  followed by European flights coming in the upper right hand corner. Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast. You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left hand corner. I think it's one thing to say there's         planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time  and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows. This is a time lapse image of that exact same data  but I've color coded it by type  so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us. And I started making these  and I put them into Google Maps and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports and the patterns that are occurring there. So here we can see the white represents low altitudes  and the blue are higher altitudes. And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta. You can see this is a major shipping airport  and there's all kinds of activity there. You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer. See again  the diversity. And you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have. This is scrolling up the East coast. You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other. So zooming back out real quick  we see  again  the U.S.    you get Florida down in the right hand corner. Moving across to the West coast  you see San Francisco and Los Angeles    big low traffic zones across Nevada and Arizona. And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom. I started taking a look as well at different perimeters  because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data. This is looking at ascending versus descending flights. And you can see  over time  the ways the airports change. You see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen. And you can see  eventually the airport actually flips directions. So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT. This is visualizing international communications. So it's how New York communicates with other international cities. And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition. And it had a live feed with a    hour offset  so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through AT T's data and revealing itself. This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.org. And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam. So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city  until we approach New Year's Eve  where everybody says   Happy New Year   So this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city. This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day. So again  you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city. And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before  which happens right here. And then you can see people celebrating the next day. And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases. So now on to something completely different. Some of you may recognize this. This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine. And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well  except for one thing  it's not a robot at all. There's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player. This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon called the Mechanical Turk    named after this guy. And it's based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people  but really difficult for computers. So they made this web service and said   Any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people.  The nerdy side of me thought   Wow  this is amazing. I can tap into thousands of people's minds.  And the other nerdy side of me thought   This is horrible. This is completely bizarre. What does this mean for the future of mankind  where we're all plugged into this borg   I was probably being a little extreme. But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on  and we're just doing these little labors  So I created this drawing tool. I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left. And I said   I'll pay you two cents for your contribution.  And I started collecting sheep. And I collected a lot  a lot of different sheep. Lots of sheep. I took the first        sheep that I collected  and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com where you can actually buy collections of    sheep. You can't pick individual sheep  but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity. And juxtaposed against this grid  you see actually  by rolling over each individual one  the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. I think there's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil    something we can all relate to  this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing. I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid. Kind of amazing what some people did. So here's a few statistics from the project. Approximate collection rate of    sheep per hour  which would make a working wage of    cents per hour. There were     rejected sheep that didn't meet  sheep like  criteria and were thrown out of the flock. The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to    minutes. That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication. And there were       people that contributed to the project  or were unique IP addresses    so about how many people contributed. But only one of them out of the       said this. Which I was pretty surprised by. I expected people to be wondering   Why did I draw a sheep   And I think it's a pretty valid question. And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep. Sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts  the first to be selectively bred for production traits  the first animal to be cloned. Obviously  we think of sheep as followers. And there's this reference to  Le Petit Prince  where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep. He draws sheep after sheep. The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box. And he says   It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep. It's about your own interpretation and doing something different.  And I like that. So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's  Modern Times.  It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the Industrial Revolution. So there were no longer shoe makers  but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes. And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot. So I thought this was an interesting clip to divide into    pieces and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool. This basically allowed    what you see on the left side is the original frame  and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by    people who have no idea what it is they're doing. And this was the inspiration for a project that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima. We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for  which is making money. So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into        teeny pieces  and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk. We asked people to draw what it was that they saw. But here there was no sheep like criteria. People  if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face  it actually made it into the bill. So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do. So we took these hundred dollar bills  and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com  where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions. And you can also trade real hundred dollar bills for fake hundred dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project  which is now known as One Laptop Per Child. This is again showing all the different contributions. You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings  like this one on top    spent a long time making realistic versions. And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces. Here on the right hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing     .      Really   That's all I'm getting paid for this  So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about is called Bicycle Built for     . This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey. You may recognize these two guys. This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '  s  where they created the song  Daisy Bell   which was the world's first singing computer. You may recognize it from        A Space Odyssey.  When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song  as a reference to when computers became human. So we resynthesized this song. This is what that sounded like. We broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing. Daisy Bell    Daisy  Daisy ...   Aaron Koblin  And we took all of those individual pieces  and we fed them into another Turk request. This is what it would look like if you went to the site. You type in your code  but you first test your mic. You'd be fed a simple audio clip. And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice. After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted  you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context. And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. Recording    Daisy  Daisy     give me your answer do     I'm half crazy     all for the love of you     It can't be a stylish marriage     I can't afford a carriage     But you'll look sweet upon the seat     of a bicycle built for two   AK  So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds  that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual. We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative  distributed music making  where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on. So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together. I'm sorry for this. Chorus    Daisy  Daisy     Give me your answer do     I'm half crazy     all for the love of you     It can't be a stylish marriage     I can't afford a carriage     But you'd look sweet upon the seat     of a bicycle built for two   AK  So stepping back for a quick second  when I was at UCLA going to grad school  I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing. And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners. So basically motion through  D space. And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost who said   Wait a minute. You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video   So we did exactly that. We made a music video for one of my favorite bands  Radiohead. And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers  but we also open sourced it  and we made it released as a Google Code project  where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it. And people were making some amazing things. This is actually two of my favorites  the pin board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke. A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content. More recently  somebody even  D printed Thom Yorke's head  which is a little creepy  but pretty cool. So with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on  I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something. And I met a music video director named Chris Milk. And we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project. But we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for. So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months. And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin  who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album called  Ain't No Grave.  The lyrics to the leading track are  Ain't no grave can hold my body down.  So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash. So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello  also known as Mr. doob  who's a much better programmer than I am  and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool. As you know  an animation is a series of images. So what we did was cross cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash  and at eight frames a second  we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video. So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you  but I want to show you two short clips. One is the beginning of the music video. And that's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly.   can hold my body down     There ain't no grave     can hold body down     When I hear the trumpet sound     I'm going to ride right out of the ground     Ain't no grave     can hold my body ...   AK  What better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs. Collaborator  I felt really sad when he died. And I just thought it'd be wonderful  it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory. Collaborator Two  It really allows this last recording of his to be a living  breathing memorial. Collaborator Three  For all of the frames to be drawn by fans  each individual frame  it's got a very powerful feeling to it. Collaborator Four  I've seen everybody from Japan  Venezuela  to the States  to Knoxville  Tennessee. Collaborator Five  As much as is different from frame to frame  it really is personal. Collaborator Six  Watching the video in my room  I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it. And I just worked and worked through problems  until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves. You can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing  and a lot of light and dark comes into it. And in a weird way  that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well. It's the sum total of his life  all the things that had happened    the bad things  the good things. You're hearing a person's life. AK  So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com  what you'll see is the video playing above. And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project. So this isn't finished at all  but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate. If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails  you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located. And if you find one that you're interested in  you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you're able to rate that frame  which helps it bubble up to the top. And you can also see the way that it was drawn. Again  you can get the playback and personal contribution. In addition to that  it's listed  the artist's name  the location  how long they spent drawing it. And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged  Abstract.  But there's a bunch of different styles. And you can sort the video a number of different ways. You can say   I want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version. And then this is  again  the abstract version  which ends up getting a little bit crazy. So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk. And this is called  The Wilderness Downtown.  It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire. Chris and I were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers  where you have HTML  audio and video and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast. And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web beyond the four by three or sixteen by nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen. But most importantly  I think  we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project  where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone. What if we had a very low commitment  but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed  So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up. And you type in the address    it actually creates a music video specifically for you  pulling in Google maps and Streetview images into the experience itself. So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address  but I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect.   Now our lives are changing fast     Hope that something pure can last     Hope that something pure can last     Ooh we used to wait     Ooh we used to wait     Ooh we used to wait     Sometimes it never came     Sometimes it never came     Still moving through the pain     We used to wait for it     We used to wait for it     We used to wait for it   AK  So I think  if there's one thing to take away from my talk today  it's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device. And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data  we have an opportunity  and maybe even an obligation  to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together. Thanks a lot. I want to share with you over the next    minutes a pretty incredible idea. Actually  it's a really big idea. But to get us started  I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world. Now I bet  in this audience  you're thinking of some really incredible technology  some stuff that I haven't even heard of  I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure  pretty sure  that absolutely nobody is thinking of this. This is a polio vaccine. And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted. This is a great technology. We can take it completely for granted. But it wasn't always that way. Even here in California  if we were to go back just a few years  it was a very different story. People were terrified of this disease. They were terrified of polio  and it would cause public panic. And it was because of scenes like this. In this scene  people are living in an iron lung. These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before  and then two days later  they can no longer breathe  and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs  but also their breathing muscles. And they were going to spend the rest of their lives  usually  in this iron lung to breathe for them. This disease was terrifying. There was no cure  and there was no vaccine. The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it. Twenty years later  they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine. It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late     s. Finally  a vaccine that could stop this awful disease  and here in the United States it had an incredible impact. As you can see  the virus stopped  and it stopped very  very fast. But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world. And it happened so fast in the United States  however  that even just last month Jon Stewart said this  Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated. Bruce Aylward  Oops. Jon  polio's almost been eradicated. But the reality is that polio still exists today. We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists. This is the picture. There's not very much left in the world. But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes  almost unknown  I'm sure to most of you here today. It's been working for    years to try and eradicate this disease  and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic. But just last year  we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio. And this is the reason  in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade  on opposite sides of the globe  there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks. Hundreds of people were paralyzed. Hundreds of people died    children as well as adults. And in both cases  we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses  and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries. They had come from thousands of miles away. And in one case  it originated on another continent. And not only that  but when they came into these countries  then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia  where  for the first time in over a decade last year  children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years. Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you  these are under control now  and it looks like they'll probably stop very  very quickly. But the message was very clear. Polio is still a devastating  explosive disease. It's just happening in another part of the world. And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership  the Polio Partnership  is trying to do. We're not trying to control polio. We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases  because this disease is like a root fire  it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely. So what we're looking for is a permanent solution. We want a world in which every child  just like you guys  can take for granted a polio free world. So we're looking for a permanent solution  and this is where we get lucky. This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary. This virus can only survive in people. It can't live for a very long time in people. It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all. And we've got pretty good vaccines  as I've just showed you. So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely. What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth. Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this  to eradicating diseases. It's been tried six times in the last century  and it's been successful exactly once. And this is because disease eradication  it's still the venture capital of public health. The risks are massive  but the pay off    economic  humanitarian  motivational    it's absolutely huge. One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every    days    in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs. And if we can finish polio eradication  the poorest countries in the world are going to save over    billion dollars in the next    years alone. So those are the kind of stakes that we're after. But smallpox eradication was hard  it was very  very hard. And polio eradication  in many ways  is even tougher  and there's a few reasons for that. The first is that  when we started trying to eradicate polio about    years ago  more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox. And there were more than    times as many people living in these countries. So it was a massive effort. The second challenge we had was    in contrast to the smallpox vaccine  which was very stable  and a single dose protected you for life    the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile. It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat  and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child    it's not potent  it's not going to protect them. Even then  kids need many doses of the vaccine. But the third challenge we have    and probably even bigger one  the biggest challenge    is that  in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy    every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash. So you could get around the disease  you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off. With polio it's almost completely different. The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease. So you can't see the enemy most of the time  and as a result  we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox. We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history. There's over    million people  probably    million people  largely volunteers  who have been working over the last    years in what has now been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime. These people  these    million people  vaccinate over     million children every single year  multiple times at the peak of our operation. Now giving the polio vaccine is simple. It's just two drops  like that. But reaching     million people is much  much tougher. And these vaccinators  these volunteers  they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest  densest urban slums in the world. They've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote  difficult to reach places in the world. And they also have to dodge bullets  because we have got to operate during shaky cease fires and truces to try and vaccinate children  even in areas affected by conflict. One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago    a place which has eradicated polio  not once  but twice  because they got reinfected. He was sitting outside of the road  watching one of these polio campaigns unfold  and a few months later he wrote   This is foreign aid at its most heroic.  And these heroes  they come from every walk of life  all sorts of backgrounds. But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International. This is a group whose million strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over    years. They're right at the center of the whole thing. Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication    more than    years  much longer than it should have    but once it was built  the results were striking. Within a couple of years  every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses  with the exception of four countries that you see here. And in each of those  it was only part of the country. And then  by       one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide    proof of concept. And then today  there's been a    percent reduction    greater than    percent reduction    in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease. When we started  over    years ago        children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus. Last year  it was      . And at the same time  the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas. It's been working to help control pandemic flu  SARS for example. It's also tried to save children by doing other things    giving vitamin A drops  giving measles shots  giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns. But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us  the international community  to reach every single child  every single community  the most vulnerable people in the world  with the most basic of health services  irrespective of geography  poverty  culture and even conflict. So things were looking very exciting  and then about five years ago  this virus  this ancient virus  started to fight back. The first problem we ran into was that  in these last four countries  the strongholds of this virus  we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out. And then to make the matters even worse  the virus started to spread out of these four places  especially northern India and northern Nigeria  into much of Africa  Asia  and even into Europe  causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades. And then  in one of the most important  tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world  we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have. In conditions like this  the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to. Now at that time  there was a great  as you can imagine  frustration    let's call it frustration    it started to grow very  very quickly. And all of a sudden  some very important voices in the world of public health started to say   Hang on. We should abandon this idea of eradication. Let's settle for control    that's good enough.  Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds  it's a false premise. The brutal truth is  if we don't have the will or the skill  or even the money that we need to reach children  the most vulnerable children in the world  with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine  then pretty soon  more than         children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year. There's absolutely no question. These are children like Umar. Umar is seven years old  and he's from northern Nigeria. He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters. Umar also has polio. Umar was paralyzed for life. His right leg was paralyzed in     . This leg  his right leg  now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl  because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends  keep up with his brothers and sisters  than to get up on his crutches and walk. But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid. As you probably can't see the detail here  but this is his report card  and you'll see  he's got perfect scores. He got     percent in all the important things  like nursery rhymes  for example there. But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days  but it's not true. Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances. The reality of polio today is something very different. Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world. It leaves their children paralyzed  and it drags their families deeper into poverty  because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have  trying in vain to find a cure for their children. We think children deserve better. And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago  when people were saying   We should call it off   the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions  new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again. In northern India  we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this  so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters  so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services. In northern Nigeria  the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders  they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence. And now they've even started using these devices    speaking of cool technology    these little devices  little GIS trackers like this  which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators. And then they can track them  and at the end of the day  they look and see  did these guys get every single street  every single house. This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing. And in Afghanistan  we're trying new approaches    access negotiators. We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child. But as we tried these extraordinary things  as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics  we went back to the vaccine    it's a    year old vaccine    and we thought  surely we can make a better vaccine  so that when they finally get to these kids  we can have a better bang for our buck. And this started an incredible collaboration with industry  and within six months  we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted  just two years ago  the last two types of polio in the world. Now June the ninth        we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine  and it turned out to be a game changer. The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had  and we immediately started using this. Well  in a couple of months we had to get it out of production. And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world. And we didn't start with the easy places. The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan  because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this. Now here at TED  over the last couple of days  I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible. So this morning at about seven o'clock  I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again  so that you could see something that's just unfolding today  which proves that the impossible is possible. And only two years ago  people were saying that this is impossible. Now remember  northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio. Over         children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio    Uttar Pradesh and Bihar            children every single month. Sanitation is terrible  and our old vaccine  you remember  worked half as well as it should have. And yet  the impossible is happening. Today marks exactly six months    and for the first time in history  not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. India's not unique. In Umar's home country of Nigeria  a    percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year. And in the last six months  we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history. Ladies and gentlemen  with a combination of smart people  smart technology and smart investments  polio can now be eradicated anywhere. We have major challenges  you can imagine  to finish this job  but as you've also seen  it's doable  it has great secondary benefits  and polio eradication is a great buy. And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus  it's a stark reminder that we are failing  as a society  to reach children with the most basic of services. And for that reason  polio eradication  it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice. The huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children. It's ready to reach them with bed nets  with other things. But capitalizing on their enthusiasm  capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started    years ago. Finishing polio is a smart thing to do  and it's the right thing to do. Now we're in tough times economically. But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio   There's never a wrong time to do the right thing.  Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do. And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last    years. We have a new vaccine  we have new resolve  and we have new tactics. We have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history. But if we blink now  we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease. Here's a great idea to spread  End polio now. Help us tell the story. Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child  every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever. Thank you. Bill Gates  Well Bruce  where do you think the toughest places are going to be  Where would you say we need to be the smartest  BA  The four places where you saw  that we've never stopped    northern Nigeria  northern India  the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan    they're going to be the toughest. But the interesting thing is  of those three  India's looking real good  as you just saw in the data. And Afghanistan  Afghanistan  we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly. It keeps getting reinfected. So the tough ones  going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished. They're going to be the tough ones. BG  Now what about the money  Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year. And is it easy to raise that money  And what's it going to be like the next couple of years  BA  It's interesting. We spend right now about     million to     million dollars a year. That's what it costs to reach     million children. It sounds like a lot of money  it is a lot of money. But when you're reaching     million children multiple times           cents to reach a child    that's not very much money. But right now we don't have enough of that. We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners  and every time we cut corners  more places get infected that shouldn't have  and it just slows us down. And that great buy costs us a little bit more. BG  Well  hopefully we'll get the word out  and the governments will keep their generosity up. So good luck. We're all in this with you. Thank you.  BA  Thank you.  The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist  as an Iranian woman artist  as an Iranian woman artist living in exile. Well  it has its pluses and minuses. On the dark side  politics doesn't seem to escape people like me. Every Iranian artist  in one form or another  is political. Politics have defined our lives. If you're living in Iran  you're facing censorship  harassment  arrest  torture    at times  execution. If you're living outside like me  you're faced with life in exile    the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family. Therefore  we don't find the moral  emotional  psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility. Oddly enough  an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice  the speaker of my people  even if I have  indeed  no access to my own country. Also  people like myself  we're fighting two battles on different grounds. We're being critical of the West  the perception of the West about our identity    about the image that is constructed about us  about our women  about our politics  about our religion. We are there to take pride and insist on respect. And at the same time  we're fighting another battle. That is our regime  our government    our atrocious government   that  has done every crime in order to stay in power. Our artists are at risk. We are in a position of danger. We pose a threat to the order of the government. But ironically  this situation has empowered all of us  because we are considered  as artists  central to the cultural  political  social discourse in Iran. We are there to inspire  to provoke  to mobilize  to bring hope to our people. We are the reporters of our people  and are communicators to the outside world. Art is our weapon. Culture is a form of resistance. I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression. For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics. From the fact that they are only serving one audience  mainly the Western culture. But also  I worry about the West  because often in this country  in this Western world that we have  culture risks being a form of entertainment. Our people depend on our artists  and culture is beyond communication. My journey as an artist started from a very  very personal place. I did not start to make social commentary about my country. The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good    years. It was after the Islamic Revolution of     . While I was absent from Iran  the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture. I came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that I found my place in the society. But instead  I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn't recognize anymore. More so  I became very interested  as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions  I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution    how  indeed  it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women. I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting  in the way the women of Iran  historically  seemed to embody the political transformation. So in a way  by studying a woman  you can read the structure and the ideology of the country. So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life  and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse    the subject of martyrdom  the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God  faith  but violence and crime and cruelty. For me  this became incredibly important. And yet  I had an unusual position toward this. I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place  but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution. This changed slowly as I found my voice and I discovered things that I didn't know I would discover. So my art became slightly more critical. My knife became a little sharper. And I fell into a life in exile. I am a nomadic artist. I work in Morocco  in Turkey  in Mexico. I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran. Now I am making films. Last year  I finished a film called  Women Without Men.   Women Without Men  returns to history  but another part of our Iranian history. It goes to      when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader  Dr. Mossadegh. The book is written by an Iranian woman  Shahrnush Parsipur. It's a magical realist novel. This book is banned  and she spent five years in prison. My obsession with this book  and the reason I made this into a film  is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female    traditionally  historically in Iran    and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change  freedom and democracy    while the country of Iran  equally  as if another character  also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions. I made this film because I felt it's important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country. That all of you seem to remember Iran after the Islamic Revolution. That Iran was once a secular society  and we had democracy  and this democracy was stolen from us by the American government  by the British government. This film also speaks to the Iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized    in the way we looked  in the way we played music  in the way we had intellectual life. And most of all  in the way that we fought for democracy. These are some of the shots actually from my film. These are some of the images of the coup. And we made this film in Casablanca  recreating all the shots. This film tried to find a balance between telling a political story  but also a feminine story. Being a visual artist  indeed  I am foremost interested to make art    to make art that transcends politics  religion  the question of feminism  and become an important  timeless  universal work of art. The challenge I have is how to do that. How to tell a political story but an allegorical story. How to move you with your emotions  but also make your mind work. These are some of the images and the characters of the film. Now comes the green movement    the summer of       as my film is released    the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran. What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film  the cry for democracy and social justice  repeats itself now again in Tehran. The green movement significantly inspired the world. It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy. What was most significant for me was  once again  the presence of the women. They're absolutely inspirational for me. If in the Islamic Revolution  the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn't have a voice  now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of Tehran    women who were educated  forward thinking  non traditional  sexually open  fearless and seriously feminist. These women and those young men united Iranians across the world  inside and outside. I then discovered why I take so much inspiration from Iranian women. That  under all circumstances  they have pushed the boundary. They have confronted the authority. They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way. And once again  they proved themselves. I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice  and their voice is giving me my voice. And it's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist  even if I have to operate in the West only for now. Thank you so much. A few weeks ago  I had a chance to go to Saudi Arabia. And the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim was go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba  the holiest shrine of Islam. And I did that  I put on my ritualistic dress  I went to the holy mosque  I did my prayers  I observed all the rituals. And meanwhile  besides all the spirituality  there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba that was pretty interesting for me. There was no separation of sexes. In other words  men and women were worshiping all together. They were together while doing the tawaf  the circular walk around the Kaaba. They were together while praying. And if you wonder why this is interesting at all  you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia because it's a country which is strictly divided between the sexes. In other words  as men  you are not simply supposed to be in the same physical space with women. And I noticed this in a very funny way. I left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca. I headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant. And I went there    I noticed that there was a male section  which was carefully separated from the female section. And I had to pay  order and eat at the male section.  It's funny   I said to myself   You can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy Kaaba  but not at the Burger King.  Quite ironic. Ironic  and it's also  I think  quite telling. Because the Kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of Islam  that of prophet Muhammad. And if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women  the rituals around the Kaaba could have been designed accordingly. But apparently that was not an issue at the time. So the rituals came that way. This is also  I think  confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the Koran  the very core of Islam    the divine core of Islam that all Muslims  and equally myself  believe. And I think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam. Because many scholars who study the history of Islamic thought    Muslim scholars or Westerners    think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in Islam  as Muslims adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the Middle East. Seclusion of women was actually a Byzantine and Persian practice  and Muslims adopted that and made that a part of their religion. And actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon. What we call today Islamic Law  and especially Islamic culture    and there are many Islamic cultures actually  the one in Saudi Arabia is much different from where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey. But still  if you're going to speak about a Muslim culture  this has a core  the divine message  which began the religion  but then many traditions  perceptions  many practices were added on top of it. And these were traditions of the Middle East    medieval traditions. And there are two important messages  or two lessons  to take from that reality. First of all  Muslims    pious  conservative  believing Muslims who want to be loyal to their religion    should not cling onto everything in their culture  thinking that that's divinely mandated. Maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed. On the other hand  the Westerners who look at Islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains. Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam. There is a practice called female circumcision. It's something terrible  horrible. It is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure. And Westerners  Europeans or Americans  who didn't know about this before faced this practice within some of the Muslim communities who migrated from North Africa. And they've thought   Oh  what a horrible religion that is which ordains something like that.  But actually when you look at female circumcision  you see that it has nothing to do with Islam  it's just a North African practice  which predates Islam. It was there for thousands of years. And quite tellingly  some Muslims do practice that. The Muslims in North Africa  not in other places. But also the non Muslim communities of North Africa    the Animists  even some Christians and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa is known to practice female circumcision. So what might look like a problem within Islamic faith might turn out to be a tradition that Muslims have subscribed to. The same thing can be said for honor killings  which is a recurrent theme in the Western media    and which is  of course  a horrible tradition. And we see truly in some Muslim communities that tradition. But in the non Muslim communities of the Middle East  such as some Christian communities  Eastern communities  you see the same practice. We had a tragic case of an honor killing within Turkey's Armenian community just a few months ago. Now these are things about general culture  but I'm also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated  or whether there's an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens. And it is no secret that many Islamic movements in the Middle East tend to be authoritarian  and some of the so called  Islamic regimes  such as Saudi Arabia  Iran and the worst case was the Taliban in Afghanistan    they are pretty authoritarian. No doubt about that. For example  in Saudi Arabia there is a phenomenon called the religious police. And the religious police imposes the supposed Islamic way of life on every citizen  by force    like women are forced to cover their heads    wear the hijab  the Islamic head cover. Now that is pretty authoritarian  and that's something I'm very much critical of. But when I realized that the non Muslim  or the non Islamic minded actors in the same geography  sometimes behaved similarly  I realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region  not just Islam. Let me give you an example  in Turkey where I come from  which is a very hyper secular republic  until very recently we used to have what I call secularism police  which would guard the universities against veiled students. In other words  they would force students to uncover their heads  and I think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it. It should be the citizen's decision. But when I saw that  I said   Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region  and some Muslims have been influenced by that. But the secular minded people can be influenced by that. Maybe it's a problem of the political culture  and we have to think about how to change that political culture.  Now these are some of the questions I had in mind a few years ago when I sat down to write a book. I said   Well I will make a research about how Islam actually came to be what it is today  and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken.  The name of the book is  Islam Without Extremes  A Muslim Case for Liberty.  And as the subtitle suggests  I looked at Islamic tradition and the history of Islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty  and I tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty. And there are strengths in Islamic tradition. Islam actually  as a monotheistic religion  which defined man as a responsible agent by itself  created the idea of the individual in the Middle East and saved it from the communitarianism  the collectivism of the tribe. You can derive many ideas from that. But besides that  I also saw problems within Islamic tradition. But one thing was curious  most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later  not from the very divine core of Islam  the Koran  but from  again  traditions and mentalities  or the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages. The Koran  for example  doesn't condone stoning. There is no punishment on apostasy. There is no punishment on personal things like drinking. These things which make Islamic Law  the troubling aspects of Islamic Law  were later developed into later interpretations of Islam. Which means that Muslims can  today  look at those things and say   Well  the core of our religion is here to stay with us. It's our faith  and we will be loyal to it. But we can change how it was interpreted  because it was interpreted according to the time and milieu in the Middle Ages. Now we are living in a different world with different values and different political systems.  That interpretation is quite possible and feasible. Now if I were the only person thinking that way  we would be in trouble. But that's not the case at all. Actually  from the   th century on  there's a whole revisionist  reformist    whatever you call it    tradition  a trend in Islamic thinking. And these were intellectuals or statesmen of the   th century  and later    th century  which looked at Europe basically and saw that Europe has many things to admire  like science and technology. But not just that  also democracy  parliament  the idea of representation  the idea of equal citizenship. These Muslim thinkers and intellectuals and statesmen of the   th century looked at Europe  saw these things. They said   Why don't we have these things   And they looked back at Islamic tradition  they saw that there are problematic aspects  but they're not the core of the religion  so maybe they can be re understood  and the Koran can be reread in the modern world. That trend is generally called Islamic modernism  and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen  not just as an intellectual idea though  but also as a political program. And that's why actually in the   th century the Ottoman Empire  which then covered the whole Middle East  made very important reforms    reforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status  accepting a constitution  accepting a representative parliament  advancing the idea of freedom of religion. And that's why the Ottoman Empire in its last decades turned into a proto democracy  a constitutional monarchy  and freedom was a very important political value at the time. Similarly  in the Arab world  there was what the great Arab historian Albert Hourani defines as the Liberal Age. He has a book   Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age   and the Liberal Age  he defines as   th century and early   th century. Quite notably  this was the dominant trend in the early   th century among Islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians. But there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the   th century  because we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line. And in place of that  what happens is that Islamism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian  which is quite strident  which is quite anti Western  and which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision. So Islamism is the problematic idea that really created a lot of problems in the   th century Islamic world. And even the very extreme forms of Islamism led to terrorism in the name of Islam    which is actually a practice that I think is against Islam  but some  obviously  extremists did not think that way. But there is a curious question  If Islamic modernism was so popular in the   th and early   th centuries  why did Islamism become so popular in the rest of the   th century  And this is a question  I think  which needs to be discussed carefully. And in my book  I went into that question as well. And actually you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that. You just look at the political history of the   th century  and you see things have changed a lot. The context has changed. In the   th century  when Muslims were looking at Europe as an example  they were independent  they were more self confident. In the early   th century  with the fall of the Ottoman Empire  the whole Middle East was colonized. And when you have colonization what do you have  You have anti colonization. So Europe is not just an example now to emulate  it's an enemy to fight and to resist. So there's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the Muslim world  and what you see is more of a defensive  rigid  reactionary strain  which led to Arab socialism  Arab nationalism and ultimately to the Islamist ideology. And when the colonial period ended  what you had in place of that was  generally  secular dictators  which say they're a country  but did not bring democracy to the country  and established their own dictatorship. And I think the West  at least some powers in the West  particularly the United States  made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators  thinking that they were more helpful for their interests. But the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed Islamic groups in their country actually made the Islamists much more strident. So in the   th century  you had this vicious cycle in the Arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people including the Islamic pious  and they're reacting in reactionary ways. There was one country  though  which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle. And that's the country where I come from  that's Turkey. Turkey has never been colonized  so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. That's one thing to remember. They did not share the same anti colonial hype that you can find in some other countries in the region. Secondly  and most importantly  Turkey became a democracy earlier than any of the countries we are talking about. In       Turkey had the first free and fair elections  which ended the more autocratic secular regime  which was the beginning of Turkey. And the pious Muslims in Turkey saw that they can change the political system by voting. And they realize that democracy is something that is compatible with Islam  compatible with their values  and they've been supportive of democracy. That's an experience that not every other Muslim nation in the Middle East had until very recently. Secondly  in the past two decades  thanks to globalization  thanks to the market economy  thanks to the rise of a middle class  we in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism. Now there's the more urban middle class pious Muslims who  again  look at their tradition and see that there are some problems in the tradition  and they understand that they need to be changed and questioned and reformed. And they look at Europe  and they see an example  again  to follow. They see an example  at least  to take some inspiration from. That's why the E.U. process  Turkey's effort to join the E.U.  has been supported inside Turkey by the Islamic pious  while some secular nations were against that. Well that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all Europeans are that welcoming    but that's another discussion. But the pro E.U. sentiment in Turkey in the past decade has become almost an Islamic cause and supported by the Islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well  of course. And thanks to that  Turkey has been able to reasonably create a success story in which Islam and the most pious understandings of Islam have become part of the democratic game  and even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country. And this has been an inspiring example right now for some of the Islamic movements or some of the countries in the Arab world. You must have all seen the Arab Spring  which began in Tunis and in Egypt. And Arab masses just revolted against their dictators. They were asking for democracy  they were asking for freedom. And they did not turn out to be the Islamist boogyman that the dictators were always using to justify their regime. They said that  we want freedom  we want democracy. We are Muslim believers  but we want to be living as free people in free societies.  Of course  this is a long road. Democracy is not an overnight achievement  it's a process. But this is a promising era in the Muslim world. And I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the   th century  but which had a setback in the   th century because of the political troubles of the Muslim world  is having a rebirth. And I think the getaway message from that would be that Islam  despite some of the skeptics in the West  has the potential in itself to create its own way to democracy  create its own way to liberalism  create its own way to freedom. They just should be allowed to work for that. Thanks so much. Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see. A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task  until now. Hello  my name is Dennis Hong  and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired. So before I talk about this car for the blind  let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge. Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself. You press start  nobody touches anything  and it can reach its destination fully autonomously. So in       our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition. So about that time  the National Federation of the Blind  or NFB  challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently. We decided to give it a try  because we thought   Hey  how hard could it be   We have already an autonomous vehicle. We just put a blind person in it and we're done  right  We couldn't have been more wrong. What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around  but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive. So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch. So to test this crazy idea  we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility. And in the summer of       we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin. It was an absolutely amazing experience. But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment  in a flat  closed off parking lot    even the lanes defined by red traffic cones. So with this success  we decided to take the next big step  to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads. So how does it work  Well  it's a rather complex system  but let me try to explain it  maybe simplify it. So we have three steps. We have perception  computation and non visual interfaces. Now obviously the driver cannot see  so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver. For that  we use an initial measurement unit. So it measures acceleration  angular acceleration    like a human ear  inner ear. We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car. We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road. And we also use three laser range finders. The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles    a car approaching from the front  the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads  any obstacles around the vehicle. So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer  and the computer can do two things. One is  first of all  process this information to have an understanding of the environment    these are the lanes of the road  there's the obstacles    and convey this information to the driver. The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car. So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle. But the problem is this  How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive  So for this  we developed many different types of non visual user interface technology. So starting from a three dimensional ping sound system  a vibrating vest  a click wheel with voice commands  a leg strip  even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot. But today we're going to talk about three of these non visual user interfaces. Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip. So these are a pair of gloves  and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer    the direction and the intensity. Another device is called SpeedStrip. So this is a chair    as a matter of fact  it's actually a massage chair. We gut it out  and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns  and we actuate them to convey information about the speed  and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal. So over here  you can see how the computer understands the environment  and because you cannot see the vibration  we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening. This is the sensory data  and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer. So these two devices  DriveGrip and SpeedStrip  are very effective. But the problem is these are instructional cue devices. So this is not really freedom  right  The computer tells you how to drive    turn left  turn right  speed up  stop. We call this the  backseat driver problem.  So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices  and we're now focusing more on the informational devices. A good example for this informational non visual user interface is called AirPix. So think of it as a monitor for the blind. So it's a small tablet  has many holes in it  and compressed air comes out  so it can actually draw images. So even though you are blind  you can put your hand over it  you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles. Actually  you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature. So it's actually a multi dimensional user interface. So here you can see the left camera  the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix. For this  we're showing a simulator  a blind person driving using the AirPix. This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non visual user interfaces. So basically that's how it works. So just a month ago  on January   th  we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex    racing event. We also had some surprises. Let's take a look. He's coming up to the grandstand  fellow Federationists. There's the grandstand now. And he's  unclear  following that van that's out in front of him. Well there comes the first box. Now let's see if Mark avoids it. He does. He passes it on the right. Third box is out. The fourth box is out. And he's perfectly making his way between the two. He's closing in on the van to make the moving pass. Well this is what it's all about  this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity. He's approaching the end of the run  makes his way between the barrels that are set up there. Dennis Hong  I'm so happy for you. Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel. Mark Riccobono  Yes. DH  So since we started this project  we've been getting hundreds of letters  emails  phone calls from people from all around the world. Letters thanking us  but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one   Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive up ATM machine.  But sometimes    But sometimes I also do get    I wouldn't call it hate mail    but letters of really strong concern   Dr. Hong  are you insane  trying to put blind people on the road  You must be out of your mind.  But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle  and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as  or safer than  today's vehicle. And I truly believe that this can happen. But still  will the society  would they accept such a radical idea  How are we going to handle insurance  How are we going to issue driver's licenses  There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality. Of course  the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind. But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin off technology that can come from this project. The sensors that are used can see through the dark  the fog and rain. And together with this new type of interfaces  we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people. Or for the blind  everyday home appliances    in the educational setting  in the office setting. Just imagine  in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non visual interfaces. This is priceless. So today  the things I've showed you today  is just the beginning. Thank you very much. I spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness    trying to see if I can actually train my mind in a particular way  like I can train my body  so I can end up with an improved feeling of overall well being. Then this January  my mother died  and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me. So in a very typical  silly designer fashion  after years worth of work  pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film. They were still done when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia. We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs. It was a little bit too funky  and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way    fashion. My studio in Bali was only    minutes away from a monkey forest  and monkeys  of course  are supposed to be the happiest of all animals. So we trained them to be able to do three separate words  to lay out them properly. You can see  there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there. The serif is not really in place. So of course  what you don't do properly yourself is never deemed done really. So this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the Sayan Valley in Indonesia. In that year  what I did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys  looking at a lot of data on this subject. And it turns out that men and women report very  very similar levels of happiness. This is a very quick overview of all the studies that I looked at. That climate plays no role. That if you live in the best climate  in San Diego in the United States  or in the shittiest climate  in Buffalo  New York  you are going to be just as happy in either place. If you make more than        bucks a year in the U.S.  any salary increase you're going to experience will have only a tiny  tiny influence on your overall well being. Black people are just as happy as white people are. If you're old or young it doesn't really make a difference. If you're ugly or if you're really  really good looking it makes no difference whatsoever. You will adapt to it and get used to it. If you have manageable health problems it doesn't really matter. Now this does matter. So now the woman on the right is actually much happier than the guy on the left    meaning that  if you have a lot of friends  and you have meaningful friendships  that does make a lot of difference. As well as being married    you are likely to be much happier than if you are single. A fellow TED speaker  Jonathan Haidt  came up with this beautiful little analogy between the conscious and the unconscious mind. He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant  the unconscious. And the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do  but the elephant really has his own ideas. If I look at my own life  I'm born in      in Austria. If I would have been born a hundred years earlier  the big decisions in my life would have been made for me    meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in  I would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did  and I would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected. I  of course  and all of us  are very much in charge of these big decisions in our lives. We live where we want to be    at least in the West. We become what we really are interested in. We choose our own profession  and we choose our own partners. And so it's quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of. If you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called George  when he decides on where he wants to live    is it Florida or North Dakota     he goes and lives in Georgia. And if you look at a guy called Dennis  when he decides what to become    is it a lawyer  or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher     best chance is that he wants to become a dentist. And if Paula decides should she marry Joe or Jack  somehow Paul sounds the most interesting. And so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons  it remains statistically true that there are more Georges living in Georgia and there are more Dennises becoming dentists and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul than statistically viable. Now I  of course  thought   Well this is American data   and I thought   Well  those silly Americans. They get influenced by things that they're not aware of. This is just completely ridiculous.  Then  of course  I looked at my mom and my dad    Karolina and Karl  and grandmom and granddad  Josefine and Josef. So I am looking still for a Stephanie. I'll figure something out. If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer  the easiest answer  of course  is do more of the stuff that I like to do and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do    for which it would be helpful to know what it is that I actually do like to do. I'm a big list maker  so I came up with a list. One of them is to think without pressure. This is a project we're working on right now with a very healthy deadline. It's a book on culture  and  as you can see  culture is rapidly drifting around. Doing things like I'm doing right now    traveling to Cannes. The example I have here is a chair that came out of the year in Bali    clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture  not being stuck behind a single computer screen all day long and be here and there. Quite consciously  design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques  just basically to fight straightforward adaptation. Being close to the content    that's the content really is close to my heart. This is a bus  or vehicle  for a charity  for an NGO that wants to double the education budget in the United States    carefully designed  so  by two inches  it still clears highway overpasses. Having end results    things that come back from the printer well  like this little business card for an animation company called Sideshow on lenticular foils. Working on projects that actually have visible impacts  like a book for a deceased German artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous. It just came out six months ago  and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany. And I think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest. And lately  to be involved in projects where I know about    percent of the project technique wise and the other    percent would be new. So in this case  it's an outside projection for Singapore on these giant Times Square like screens. And I of course knew stuff  as a designer  about typography  even though we worked with those animals not so successfully. But I didn't quite know all that much about movement or film. And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project. But also because the content was very close. In this case   Keeping a Diary Supports Personal Development     I've been keeping a diary since I was   . And I've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intriguing way. In this case also because it's part of one of the many sentiments that we build the whole series on    that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary. Thank you so much. This is a representation of your brain  and your brain can be broken into two parts. There's the left half  which is the logical side  and then the right half  which is the intuitive. And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere  then we can plot our brain. And for example  this would be somebody who's completely logical. This would be someone who's entirely intuitive. So where would you put your brain on this scale  Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes  but I think for most people in the audience  your brain is something like this    with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time. It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything. You can be logical and intuitive. And so I consider myself one of these people  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists  who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas. But at the same time  we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work. How do we develop this intuition  Well we like to play with stuff. So we go out and play with it  and then we see how it acts  and then we develop our intuition from there. And really you do the same thing. So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time. I mean  it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time  but you weren't born with this notion  you developed it. And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop. He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it  and he kept falling over. But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them  and that they stay in one place. And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world  unless you're a particle physicist. It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist  because they don't play with car stops  they play with these little weird particles. And when they play with their particles  they find they do all sorts of really weird things    like they can fly right through walls  or they can be in two different places at the same time. And so they wrote down all these observations  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics. And so that's where physics was at a few years ago  you needed quantum mechanics to describe little  tiny particles. But you didn't need it to describe the large  everyday objects around us. This didn't really sit well with my intuition  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often. Well  I play with them sometimes  but not very often. And I've never seen them. I mean  nobody's ever seen a particle. But it didn't sit well with my logical side either. Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics  I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics. So a few years ago  I set off to do just that. So I made one. This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip. And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle. And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute. This is a photograph of the object. And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center. And then here's a really  really big close up of the little piece of metal. So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal  and it's shaped like a diving board  and it's sticking out over a ledge. And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip. I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about     hours. For the last stuff  I had to build my own machine    to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device. This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition  but it needs a little help to do it. Here  let me give you an analogy. You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator  I mean  when I'm in an elevator all alone  I do all sorts of weird things  but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them  or  frankly  scare them. So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people  but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room. And so we knew  if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. And so that's what we did. We turned off the lights  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air  and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Now  all alone in the elevator  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted. And so we measured its motion. We found it was moving in really weird ways. Instead of just sitting perfectly still  it was vibrating  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this    like expanding and contracting bellows. And by giving it a gentle nudge  we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time    something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics. So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time  So let's think about the atoms. So in one case  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down. Now it's only at precise times when they align. The rest of the time they're delocalized. That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places. I think this is really cool. Really. It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because  check this out  the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you. So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time  that chunk of metal can be in two different places  then why not you  I mean  this is just my logical side talking. So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time  what would that be like  How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space  There's one more part to the story. It's when we warmed it up  and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box  we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece. And so I had to develop this new intuition  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected. Well  that's not quite right. It's more than that  it's deeper. It's that those connections  your connections to all the things around you  literally define who you are  and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. Thank you. I'm Jessi  and this is my suitcase. But before I show you what I've got inside  I'm going to make a very public confession  and that is  I'm outfit obsessed. I love finding  wearing  and more recently  photographing and blogging a different  colorful  crazy outfit for every single occasion. But I don't buy anything new. I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores. Aww  thank you. Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet. I get to meet all kinds of great people  my dollars usually go to a good cause  I look pretty unique  and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt. I mean  what am I going to find today  Is it going to be my size  Will I like the color  Will it be under      If all the answers are yes  I feel as though I've won. I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED. I mean  what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her  So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought. I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it. Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase. I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs. And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear    that means I found a few things. And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now. Does that sound good  So as I do this  I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that  believe it or not  I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new. So let's start with Sunday. I call this  Shiny Tiger.  You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great. You can almost always look phenomenal for under    . This whole outfit  including the jacket  cost me      and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week. Monday  Color is powerful. It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants. If you are happy  you are going to attract other happy people to you. Tuesday  Fitting in is way overrated. I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in. Just be who you are. If you are surrounding yourself with the right people  they will not only get it  they will appreciate it. Wednesday  Embrace your inner child. Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress up  or that I remind them of their seven year old. I like to smile and say   Thank you.  Thursday  Confidence is key. If you think you look good in something  you almost certainly do. And if you don't think you look good in something  you're also probably right. I grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out. But it wasn't until I turned    that I really got what this meant. And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second. If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out  there is no look that you can't pull off. So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience. We should be able to rock anything we want to rock. Thank you. Friday  A universal truth    five words for you  Gold sequins go with everything. And finally  Saturday  Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word. It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing  and we've had great conversations. So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase. So before I go home to Brooklyn  I'm going to donate everything back. Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go. I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner  there is always going to be another crazy  colorful  shiny outfit just waiting for me  if I put a little love in my heart and look. Thank you very much. Thank you. Power. That is the word that comes to mind. We're the new technologists. We have a lot of data  so we have a lot of power. How much power do we have  Scene from a movie   Apocalypse Now     great movie. We've got to get our hero  Captain Willard  to the mouth of the Nung River so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz. The way we're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off. So the scene  the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in. And there's this loud  thrilling music in the background  this wild music.   Dum da ta da dum     Dum da ta da dum     Da ta da da   That's a lot of power. That's the kind of power I feel in this room. That's the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have. Let's take an example. What can we do with just one person's data  What can we do with that guy's data  I can look at your financial records. I can tell if you pay your bills on time. I know if you're good to give a loan to. I can look at your medical records  I can see if your pump is still pumping    see if you're good to offer insurance to. I can look at your clicking patterns. When you come to my website  I actually know what you're going to do already because I've seen you visit millions of websites before. And I'm sorry to tell you  you're like a poker player  you have a tell. I can tell with data analysis what you're going to do before you even do it. I know what you like. I know who you are  and that's even before I look at your mail or your phone. Those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have. But I'm not actually here to talk about what we can do. I'm here to talk about what we should do. What's the right thing to do  Now I see some puzzled looks like   Why are you asking us what's the right thing to do  We're just building this stuff. Somebody else is using it.  Fair enough. But it brings me back. I think about World War II    some of our great technologists then  some of our great physicists  studying nuclear fission and fusion    just nuclear stuff. We gather together these physicists in Los Alamos to see what they'll build. We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology. So what should we be doing with that guy's data  Should we be collecting it  gathering it  so we can make his online experience better  So we can make money  So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good  Or should we respect his privacy  protect his dignity and leave him alone  Which one is it  How should we figure it out  I know  crowdsource. Let's crowdsource this. So to get people warmed up  let's start with an easy question    something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about  iPhone versus Android. Let's do a show of hands    iPhone. Uh huh. Android. You'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones. Next question  a little bit harder. Should we be collecting all of that guy's data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good  Or should we leave him alone  Collect his data. Leave him alone. You're safe. It's fine. Okay  last question    harder question    when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case  should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework  or should we use a Millian consequentialist one  Kant. Mill. Not as many votes. Yeah  that's a terrifying result. Terrifying  because we have stronger opinions about our hand held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions. How do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don't have a moral framework  We know more about mobile operating systems  but what we really need is a moral operating system. What's a moral operating system  We all know right and wrong  right  You feel good when you do something right  you feel bad when you do something wrong. Our parents teach us that  praise with the good  scold with the bad. But how do we figure out what's right and wrong  And from day to day  we have the techniques that we use. Maybe we just follow our gut. Maybe we take a vote    we crowdsource. Or maybe we punt    ask the legal department  see what they say. In other words  it's kind of random  kind of ad hoc  how we figure out what we should do. And maybe  if we want to be on surer footing  what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there  that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place  and how would we know in a given situation what to do. So let's get a moral framework. We're numbers people  living by numbers. How can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework  I know a guy who did exactly that. A brilliant guy    he's been dead       years. Plato  that's right. Remember him    old philosopher  You were sleeping during that class. And Plato  he had a lot of the same concerns that we did. He was worried about right and wrong. He wanted to know what is just. But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this. He says something's just. She says something else is just. It's kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too. I'm just going back and forth  I'm not getting anywhere. I don't want opinions  I want knowledge. I want to know the truth about justice    like we have truths in math. In math  we know the objective facts. Take a number  any number    two. Favorite number. I love that number. There are truths about two. If you've got two of something  you add two more  you get four. That's true no matter what thing you're talking about. It's an objective truth about the form of two  the abstract form. When you have two of anything    two eyes  two ears  two noses  just two protrusions    those all partake of the form of two. They all participate in the truths that two has. They all have two ness in them. And therefore  it's not a matter of opinion. What if  Plato thought  ethics was like math  What if there were a pure form of justice  What if there are truths about justice  and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated  partook of that form of justice  Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't. It wouldn't be a matter of just opinion or just appearances. That's a stunning vision. I mean  think about that. How grand. How ambitious. That's as ambitious as we are. He wants to solve ethics. He wants objective truths. If you think that way  you have a Platonist moral framework. If you don't think that way  well  you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy  because the tidy idea  you know  people criticized it. Aristotle  in particular  he was not amused. He thought it was impractical. Aristotle said   We should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows.  Aristotle thought ethics wasn't a lot like math. He thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here and now using our best judgment to find the right path. If you think that  Plato's not your guy. But don't give up. Maybe there's another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework. How about this  What if in any situation you could just calculate  look at the choices  measure out which one's better and know what to do  That sound familiar  That's a utilitarian moral framework. John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this    nice guy besides    and only been dead     years. So basis of utilitarianism    I'm sure you're familiar at least. The three people who voted for Mill before are familiar with this. But here's the way it works. What if morals  what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain  It does something intrinsic to the act. It's not like its relation to some abstract form. It's just a matter of the consequences. You just look at the consequences and see if  overall  it's for the good or for the worse. That would be simple. Then we know what to do. Let's take an example. Suppose I go up and I say   I'm going to take your phone.  Not just because it rang earlier  but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation. I thought  that guy looks suspicious. And what if he's been sending little messages to Bin Laden's hideout    or whoever took over after Bin Laden    and he's actually like a terrorist  a sleeper cell. I'm going to find that out  and when I find that out  I'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause. That has a very high utility to prevent that damage. And compared to the little pain that it's going to cause    because it's going to be embarrassing when I'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a Farmville problem and that whole bit    that's overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone. If you feel that way  that's a utilitarian choice. But maybe you don't feel that way either. Maybe you think  it's his phone. It's wrong to take his phone because he's a person and he has rights and he has dignity  and we can't just interfere with that. He has autonomy. It doesn't matter what the calculations are. There are things that are intrinsically wrong    like lying is wrong  like torturing innocent children is wrong. Kant was very good on this point  and he said it a little better than I'll say it. He said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct  and then it is our duty to follow those rules. It's not a matter of calculation. So let's stop. We're right in the thick of it  this philosophical thicket. And this goes on for thousands of years  because these are hard questions  and I've only got    minutes. So let's cut to the chase. How should we be making our decisions  Is it Plato  is it Aristotle  is it Kant  is it Mill  What should we be doing  What's the answer  What's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do  whether we should use that guy's data or not  What's the formula  There's not a formula. There's not a simple answer. Ethics is hard. Ethics requires thinking. And that's uncomfortable. I know  I spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence  trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us  that could give us answers. But they can't. You can't just take human thinking and put it into a machine. We're the ones who have to do it. Happily  we're not machines  and we can do it. Not only can we think  we must. Hannah Arendt said   The sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil. It arises from not thinking.  That's what she called the  banality of evil.  And the response to that is that we demand the exercise of thinking from every sane person. So let's do that. Let's think. In fact  let's start right now. Every person in this room do this  think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing  where you wondered   What should I be doing   Bring that to mind  and now reflect on that and say   How did I come up that decision  What did I do  Did I follow my gut  Did I have somebody vote on it  Or did I punt to legal   Or now we have a few more choices.  Did I evaluate what would be the highest pleasure like Mill would  Or like Kant  did I use reason to figure out what was intrinsically right   Think about it. Really bring it to mind. This is important. It is so important we are going to spend    seconds of valuable TEDTalk time doing nothing but thinking about this. Are you ready  Go. Stop. Good work. What you just did  that's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power. Now the next step    try this. Go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision. Not right now. Wait till I finish talking. Do it over lunch. And don't just find another technologist friend  find somebody different than you. Find an artist or a writer    or  heaven forbid  find a philosopher and talk to them. In fact  find somebody from the humanities. Why  Because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists. Just a few days ago  right across the street from here  there was hundreds of people gathered together. It was technologists and humanists at that big BiblioTech Conference. And they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective. You have someone from Google talking to someone who does comparative literature. You're thinking about the relevance of   th century French theater    how does that bear upon venture capital  Well that's interesting. That's a different way of thinking. And when you think in that way  you become more sensitive to the human considerations  which are crucial to making ethical decisions. So imagine that right now you went and you found your musician friend. And you're telling him what we're talking about  about our whole data revolution and all this    maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music.   Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum   Well  your musician friend will stop you and say   You know  the theme music for your data revolution  that's an opera  that's Wagner. It's based on Norse legend. It's Gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry.  That's interesting. Now it's also a beautiful opera  and we're moved by that opera. We're moved because it's about the battle between good and evil  about right and wrong. And we care about right and wrong. We care what happens in that opera. We care what happens in  Apocalypse Now.  And we certainly care what happens with our technologies. We have so much power today  it is up to us to figure out what to do  and that's the good news. We're the ones writing this opera. This is our movie. We figure out what will happen with this technology. We determine how this will all end. Thank you. When I was growing up in Montana  I had two dreams. I wanted to be a paleontologist  a dinosaur paleontologist  and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur. And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life. I was very fortunate early in my career. I was fortunate in finding things. I wasn't very good at reading things. In fact  I don't read much of anything. I am extremely dyslexic  and so reading is the hardest thing I do. But instead  I go out and I find things. Then I just pick things up. I basically practice for finding money on the street. And I wander about the hills  and I have found a few things. And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests  the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones. And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big  stupid  green reptiles that people had thought for so many years. People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special. And so  at that time  I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues. We were able to actually say that dinosaurs    based on the evidence we had    that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young  brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds. So it was pretty interesting stuff. I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social. We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults. The appearance of them would have been different    which it is in all social animals. In social groups of animals  the juveniles always look different than the adults. The adults can recognize the juveniles  the juveniles can recognize the adults. And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like. And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around. But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton. And in his book  he talked about the social animals. And then Steven Spielberg  of course  depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures. The theme of this story is building a dinosaur  and so we come to that part of  Jurassic Park.  Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life. You all know the story  right. I mean  I assume everyone here has seen  Jurassic Park.  If you want to make a dinosaur  you go out  you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap    otherwise known as amber    that has some blood sucking insects in it  good ones  and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA  because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out. And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it. And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg  or something like that  and then you wait  and  lo and behold  out pops a little baby dinosaur. And everybody's happy about that. And they're happy over and over again. They keep doing it  they just keep making these things. And then  then  then  and then ... Then the dinosaurs  being social  act out their socialness  and they get together  and they conspire. And  of course  that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie    conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around. So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it  and you drilled into it  and you got something out of that insect  and you cloned it  and you did it over and over and over again  you'd have a room full of mosquitos. And probably a whole bunch of trees as well. Now if you want dinosaur DNA  I say go to the dinosaur. So that's what we've done. Back in      when the movie came out  we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur  and we chose the dinosaur on the left  a Tyrannosaurus rex  which was a very nice specimen. And one of my former doctoral students  Dr. Mary Schweitzer  actually had the background to do this sort of thing. And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex  one of the thigh bones  and she actually found some very interesting structures in there. They found these red circular looking objects  and they looked  for all the world  like red blood cells. And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone. And so she thought  well  what the heck. So she sampled some material out of it. Now it wasn't DNA  she didn't find DNA. But she did find heme  which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin. And that was really cool. That was interesting. That was    here we have    million year old heme. Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it. So a few years went by  and then we started the Hell Creek Project. And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find  and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them. And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space  a lot of badlands  and not very many people  and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff. And we did find a lot of stuff. We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs  but we found one special Tyrannosaur  and we called it B rex. And B rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock. It wasn't a very complete T. rex  and it wasn't a very big T. rex  but it was a very special B rex. And I and my colleagues cut into it  and we were able to determine  by looking at lines of arrested growth  some lines in it  that B rex had died at the age of   . We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived  because we haven't found the oldest one yet. But this one died at the age of   . We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer  and she was actually able to determine that B rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone. Medullary tissue is the calcium build up  the calcium storage basically  when an animal is pregnant  when a bird is pregnant. So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs. But Mary went further. She took the bone  and she dumped it into acid. Now we all know that bones are fossilized  and so if you dump it into acid  there shouldn't be anything left. But there was something left. There were blood vessels left. There were flexible  clear blood vessels. And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur. It was extraordinary. But she also found osteocytes  which are the cells that laid down the bones. And try and try  we could not find DNA  but she did find evidence of proteins. But we thought maybe    well  we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground. We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast. And so we built a laboratory in the back of an    wheeler trailer  and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples. And we did. We got better material. The cells looked better. The vessels looked better. Found the protein collagen. I mean  it was wonderful stuff. But it's not dinosaur DNA. So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA  and all DNA  just breaks down too fast. We're just not going to be able to do what they did in  Jurassic Park.  We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur. But birds are dinosaurs. Birds are living dinosaurs. We actually classify them as dinosaurs. We now call them non avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs. So the non avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct. Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds. So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them. I know  you're as bad as the sixth graders. The sixth graders look at it and they say   No.   You can call it a dinosaur  but look at the velociraptor  the velociraptor is cool.   The chicken is not.  So this is our problem  as you can imagine. The chicken is a dinosaur. I mean it really is. You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way. But the sixth graders demand it.  Fix the chicken.  So that's what I'm here to tell you about  how we are going to fix a chicken. So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken. Because evolution works  we actually have some evolutionary tools. We'll call them biological modification tools. We have selection. And we know selection works. We started out with a wolf like creature and we ended up with a Maltese. I mean  that's    that's definitely genetic modification. Or any of the other funny looking little dogs. We also have transgenesis. Transgenesis is really cool too. That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one. That's how people make GloFish. You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish  and  puff  they glow. And that's pretty cool. And they obviously make a lot of money off of them. And now they're making Glow rabbits and Glow all sorts of things. I guess we could make a glow chicken. But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth graders either. But there's another thing. There's what we call atavism activation. And atavism activation is basically    an atavism is an ancestral characteristic. You heard that occasionally children are born with tails  and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic. And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen. Snakes are occasionally born with legs. And here's an example. This is a chicken with teeth. A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth  and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens. Now that's a good characteristic. We can save that one. We know we can use that. We can make a chicken with teeth. That's getting closer. That's better than a glowing chicken. A friend of mine  a colleague of mine  Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University  is actually looking at atavisms. And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop  and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail. He's also interested in the transformation of the arm  the hand  to the wing. He's looking for those genes as well. And I said   Well  if you can find those  I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders.  And so he agreed. And so that's what we're looking into. If you look at dinosaur hands  a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it. Archaeopteryx  which is a bird  a primitive bird  still has that very primitive hand. But as you can see  the pigeon  or a chicken or anything else  another bird  has kind of a weird looking hand  because the hand is a wing. But the cool thing is that  if you look in the embryo  as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand. It has the three fingers  the three digits. But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together. And so what we're looking for is that gene. We want to stop that gene from turning on  fusing those hands together  so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three fingered hand  like the archaeopteryx. And the same goes for the tails. Birds have basically rudimentary tails. And so we know that in embryo  as the animal is developing  it actually has a relatively long tail. But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail  gets rid of it. So that's the other gene we're looking for. We want to stop that tail from resorbing. So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken  modify it and make the chickenosaurus. It's a cooler looking chicken. But it's just the very basics. So that really is what we're doing. And people always say   Why do that  Why make this thing  What good is it   Well  that's a good question. Actually  I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things. And quite frankly  I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it  he could actually advertise an extra piece. Anyway    When our dino chicken hatches  it will be  obviously  the poster child  or what you might call a poster chick  for technology  entertainment and design. Thank you. This story is about taking imagination seriously. Fourteen years ago  I first encountered this ordinary material  fishnet  used the same way for centuries. Today  I'm using it to create permanent  billowing  voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world. I was an unlikely person to be doing this. I never studied sculpture  engineering or architecture. In fact  after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven. I went off on my own to become an artist  and I painted for    years  when I was offered a Fulbright to India. Promising to give exhibitions of paintings  I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram. The deadline for the show arrived    my paints didn't. I had to do something. This fishing village was famous for sculpture. So I tried bronze casting. But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive. I went for a walk on the beach  watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand. I'd seen it every day  but this time I saw it differently    a new approach to sculpture  a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials. My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen. It's a self portrait titled  Wide Hips.  We hoisted them on poles to photograph. I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns. I was mesmerized. I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans  next in Lithuania with lace makers. I liked the fine detail it gave my work  but I wanted to make them larger    to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in. Returning to India to work with those fishermen  we made a net of a million and a half hand tied knots    installed briefly in Madrid. Thousands of people saw it  and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto  Portugal. He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city. I didn't know if I could do that and preserve my art. Durable  engineered  permanent    those are in opposition to idiosyncratic  delicate and ephemeral. For two years  I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays  salt  air  pollution  and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind. We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle. So we raised this        pound steel ring. We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds. But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving. I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel. He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement. I couldn't build this the way I knew because hand tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane. So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory  learned the variables of their machines  and figured out a way to make lace with them. There was no language to translate this ancient  idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce. So we had to create one. Three years and two children later  we raised this        square foot lace net. It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built  permanent and had lost nothing in translation. This intersection had been bland and anonymous. Now it had a sense of place. I walked underneath it for the first time. As I watched the wind's choreography unfold  I felt sheltered and  at the same time  connected to limitless sky. My life was not going to be the same. I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world. I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work. Historic Philadelphia City Hall  its plaza  I felt  needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting. So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing  discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet. I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time    like an X ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding. Next challenge  the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked  could I represent the    nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture  I didn't know where to begin  but I said yes. I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean. It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates  sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day. So I contacted NOAA  and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami  and translated it into this. Its title    .    refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth's day was shortened. I couldn't build this with a steel ring  the way I knew. Its shape was too complex now. So I replaced the metal armature with a soft  fine mesh of a fiber    times stronger than steel. The sculpture could now be entirely soft  which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings    literally becoming part of the fabric of the city. There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity. So we had to create it. Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line. This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers. They don't have funding yet  but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed. Fourteen years ago  I searched for beauty in the traditional things  in craft forms. Now I combine them with hi tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous  billowing forms the scale of buildings. My artistic horizons continue to grow. I'll leave you with this story. I got a call from a friend in Phoenix. An attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art  never visited the local art museum  dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture. There they were in their business suits  laying in the grass  noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know  sharing the rediscovery of wonder. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In       I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development. Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work  they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents. Now we're a long way away from that goal right now. There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them. But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them. So we could easily supply the world with dozens  maybe hundreds  of new cities. Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities. But just substitute apartment building for cities. Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them  the other half aren't there yet. You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments. But you know what you'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction. So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions. But you could go out someplace brand new  build a brand new apartment building  as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way. So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name  charter cities. Later I learned that at about this same time  Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras. They knew that about        Hondurans every year would leave to go to the United States  and they wanted to ask  what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Honduras. At one point  Javier said to Octavio   What if we took some of our empty land    what if we just gave it to an embassy    give some to the U.S. embassy  give some to the Canadian embassy    and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States  they can go get jobs  do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do   In the summer of       Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis. At the next regularly scheduled election  Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform  but reconciliation as well. He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff. Meanwhile  I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal. Through a process of refinement  trial and error  a lot of user testing  I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials. The first point was the importance of rules  like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders. We pay a lot of attention to new technologies  but it takes technologies and rules to get progress  and it's usually the rules that hold us back. In the fall of       a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk. He showed it to Javier. They called me. They said   Let's present this to the leaders of our country.  So in December we met in Miami  in a hotel conference room. I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are  how much more valuable they are than they cost. And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City  notice  land that's worth thousands of dollars  in some cases  per square meter. But it was a fairly abstract discussion  and at some point when there was a pause  Octavio said   Paul  maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.  So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms  a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in  to go live under those rules or not. So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project  this is important  this could be the way forward for our country. I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth. So I presented another fact filled lecture that included a slide like this  which tried to make the point that  if you want to create a lot of value in a city  it has to be very big. This is a picture of Denver  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver. This airport alone covers more than     square kilometers. So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans  if you build a new city  you've got to start with a site that's at least       square kilometers. That's more than     hundred thousand acres. Everybody applauded politely. The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive. The leader of the congress came up on stage and said   Professor Romer  thank you very much for your lecture  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk. I've got it here on my laptop.  So I sat down  and they played the TEDTalk. And it got to the essence  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people. There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North. And it also involved new choices for leaders. Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries  who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement  so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced. And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust. We went and looked at a site. This picture's from there. It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers. And shortly thereafter  on January   th  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions. In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was     to one. All parties  all factions in society  backed this. To be part of the constitution  you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. On February   th they passed it again with another vote of     to one. Immediately after that vote  on February   st to the   th  a delegation of about    Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business. One is South Korea. This is a picture of a big  new city center that's being built in South Korea    bigger than downtown Boston. Everything you see there was built in four years  after they spent four years getting the permits. The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore. They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third. So if you think about this practically  here's where we are. They've got a site  they're already thinking about this site for the second city. They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in  and also an external legal system. One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there. There's designers and builders of cities who are very interested. They even can bring with them some financing. But the one thing you know they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants. There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas  especially in a place with a free trade zone  and there's lots of people who'd like to go there. Around the world  there's     million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now. There's a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States. Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job    sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing. Sadly  sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen  in some cases  for a decade. So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras  Or to build a dozen of these  or a hundred of these  around the world  What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents  This is an idea worth spreading. And my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you  TED. I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of      on the exact same day  at the exact same moment  each conceiving a baby    okay  So two couples each conceiving one baby. Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception  you're not going to listen to me. So just imagine that for a moment. And in this scenario  I want to imagine that  in one case  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome  meeting that X chromosome of the egg. And in the other case  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome  meeting the X chromosome of the egg. Both are viable  both take off. We'll come back to these people later. So I wear two hats in most of what I do. As the one hat  I do history of anatomy. I'm a historian by training  and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy    meaning human bodies  animal bodies    how they dealt with bodily fluids  concepts of bodies  how have they thought about bodies. The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist  as a patient advocate    or  as I sometimes say  as an impatient advocate    for people who are patients of doctors. In that case  what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms. So some of what I've worked on  for example  is people who are conjoined twins    two people within one body. Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism    so people who are much shorter than typical. And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex    so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types. And as a general term  we can use the term intersex for this. Intersex comes in a lot of different forms. I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female. So in one instance  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto gonads  which we all have in the fetal life  to become testes. And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone. But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone  the body doesn't react to the testosterone. And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome. So lots of levels of testosterone  but no reaction to it. As a consequence  the body develops more along the female typical path. When the child is born  she looks like a girl. She is a girl. She is raised as a girl. And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts  but she's not getting her period  that somebody figures out something's up here. And they do some tests and figure out that  instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus  she actually has testes inside  and she has a Y chromosome. Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male  but they're really not. Females  like males  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands. They're in the back of our body. And the adrenal glands make androgens  which are a masculinizing hormone. Most females like me    I believe myself to be a typical female    I don't actually know my chromosomal make up but I think I'm probably typical    most females like me are actually androgen sensitive. We're making androgen  and we're responding to androgens. The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome. So sex is really complicated  it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum    in some ways  they can be all over the place. Another example  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was    years old  who was born a boy  raised a boy  had a girlfriend  had sex with his girlfriend  had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside. What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. He had XX chromosomes  and in the womb  his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created  essentially  a masculine hormonal environment. And as a consequence  his genitals were masculinzed  his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones. And he was born looking like a boy    nobody suspected anything. And it was only when he had reached the age of    that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally  that doctors figured out that  in fact  he was female internally. Okay  so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex. Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis  which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. And we're not exactly sure why that happens. So sex can come in lots of different varieties. The reason that children with these kinds of bodies    whether it's dwarfism  or it's conjoined twinning  or it's an intersex type    are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health. In many cases  people are actually perfectly healthy. The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories. Or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity. So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity  what it means to be a black person is  allegedly  is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history. And so we have this terribly simplistic idea. And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different  it startles us in terms of those categorizations. So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism. And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism. Well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body. Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner  Caster Semenya  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin. I had a lot of journalists calling me  asking me   Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female   And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test. In fact  we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female  or between male and intersex and female and intersex  we actually draw that line on nature. So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes  the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. And it's not just in terms of sex. It's also in terms of race  which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed. As we look  we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas. We look  for example  about the fact that we share at least    percent of our DNA with chimpanzees. What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides  And as we get farther and farther with our science  we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic. So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life. One of the places we're seeing it  for example  in our culture today  in the United States today  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life. We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human  such that it has a different right than a fetal life. We have very difficult conversations nowadays    probably not out in the open as much as within medicine    about the question of when somebody's dead. In the past  our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead. At most  they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose  and if it twitched  they didn't bury them yet. If it stopped twitching  you bury them. But today  we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings. And as a consequence  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead  and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before. Now you might think that all this breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy. I'm a political progressive  I defend people with unusual bodies  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous. Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense. And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy. So in order to tell you about that tension  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers. I know they were racists  I know they were sexist  but they were great. I mean  they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical        every few years  and it's not because of the music  which is totally forgettable. It's because of what happened in      with the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers were  for my point of view  the original anatomical activists  and this is why. What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for     years. So as you all recall  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy  and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy. The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA  but they did have a concept of birthright. They had a concept of blue blood. They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth. The Founding Fathers rejected that idea  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept  and that concept was all men are created equal. They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy  not the difference in anatomy  and that was a really radical thing to do. Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together. And that was democracy growing up  but it was also science growing up at the same time. And it's really clear  if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers  a lot of them were very interested in science  and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world. They were moving away from supernatural explanations  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power  where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright. They were moving towards a naturalistic concept. And if you look  for example  in the Declaration of Independence  they talk about nature and nature's God. They don't talk about God and God's nature. They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are. So as part of that  they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality. And in doing so  they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future. They didn't think of it that way  but they did it for us  and it was great. So what happened years afterward  What happened was women  for example  who wanted the right to vote  took the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said   The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote  the right to full citizenship  the right to own property  etc.  etc.  And women successfully argued that. Next came the successful Civil Rights movement  where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about   Ain't I a woman   We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying   I am a man.  Again  people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy  again  successfully. We see the same thing with the disability rights movement. The problem is  of course  that  as we begin to look at all that commonality  we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions. Now mind you  I want to maintain some divisions  anatomically  in our culture. For example  I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human. I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy. I don't want to say five year olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry. So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain. But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning. So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk. We have two beings  both conceived in the middle of      on the exact same day. Let's imagine one of them  Mary  is born three months prematurely  so she's born on June        . Henry  by contrast  is born at term  so he's born on March        . Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months  she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does    the right to consent to sex  the right to vote  the right to drink. Henry has to wait for all of that  not because he's actually any different in age  biologically  except in terms of when he was born. We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are. Henry  by virtue of being assumed to be male    although I haven't told you that he's the XY one    by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted  which Mary does not need to worry about. Mary  meanwhile  cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states  namely  the right to marry. Henry can marry in every state a woman  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman. So we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable. And the question to me becomes  What do we do  as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy  that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart  I don't want to give up the science  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us. So where do we go  It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude   Well  we have to draw the line somewhere  so we will draw the line somewhere.  But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position. So for example  Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome. Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes. But this is also very bizarre  because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome. If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy  Dr. Martin Luther King  he offers us something of a solution in his  I have a dream  speech. He says we should judge people  based not on the color of their skin  but on the content of their character   moving beyond anatomy. And I want to say   Yeah  that sounds like a really good idea.  But in practice  how do you do it  How do you judge people based on the content of character  I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans  because  I have to admit  that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know. I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed  intelligent  mature decisions about sexual relations than some    year olds that I know. So how do we operationalize the question of content of character  It turns out to be really difficult. And part of me also wonders  what if content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future    able to be seen with an fMRI  Do we really want to go there  I'm not sure where we go. What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy. We've done a really good job struggling with democracy  and I think we would do a good job in the future. We don't have a situation that Iran has  for example  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change  in which case he's allowed to live. We don't have that kind of situation. I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with    a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them  partly to make a name for himself. But when I was on the phone with him  asking why he was going to do this surgery    this was a very high risk surgery    his answer was that  in this other nation  these children were going to be treated very badly  and so he had to do this. My response to him was   Well  have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery   The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state. So I think we have to be in the lead. Well  just to close  I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the fathers. And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like  or might have looked like  if we had more involved the mothers. And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist  and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies  particularly when we have people thinking in groups. Now for years  because I've been interested in intersex  I've also been interested in sex difference research. And one of the things that I've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world. And what we know from cross cultural studies is that females  on average    not everyone  but on average    are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group. And so if we think about that  we have an interesting situation on our hands. Years ago  when I was in graduate school  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism    I considered myself a feminist  as I still do    asked a really strange question. He said   Tell me what's feminine about feminism.  And I thought   Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender  so there's nothing feminine about feminism.  But the more I thought about his question  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism. That is to say  there might be something  on average  different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable. So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state  it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept  what we would have is more of a concept of  not just how to protect  but how to care for each other. And maybe that's where we need to go in the future  when we take democracy beyond anatomy  is to think less about the individual body  in terms of the identity  and think more about those relationships. So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union  we're thinking about what we do for each other. Thank you. From all outward appearances  John had everything going for him. He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six figure profit  and he'd only owned it for five years. The school where he graduated from with his master's had just offered him a teaching appointment  which meant not only a salary  but benefits for the first time in ages. And yet  despite everything going really well for John  he was struggling  fighting addiction and a gripping depression. On the night of June   th        he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below. Remarkably    no  miraculously    he lived. The fall shattered his right arm  broke every rib that he had  punctured his lung  and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River  under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry  where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain  contacted the boat's captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital. And that's actually where our story begins. Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together    first physically  then emotionally  and then spiritually    he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did. Research shows that    out of    people who attempt suicide will fail. But the people who fail are    times more likely to succeed the second time. This truly is an at risk population with very few resources to support them. And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life  because of our taboos around suicide  we're not sure what to say  and so quite often we say nothing. And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in. I know John's story very well because I'm John. And this is  today  the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on. But after having lost a beloved teacher in      and a good friend last year to suicide  and sitting last year at TEDActive  I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading    and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help. As the Trevor Project says  it gets better. It gets way better. And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you  to urge you  that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide  or you know somebody who has  talk about it  get help. It's a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. Thank you. A couple of years ago when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach  I met Harriet. We'd actually met online before    not the way you're thinking. We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey  one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies. And because we shared our genetic information with Linda  she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA    Haplotype K a b a    which meant that we were distantly related. We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman. So Ozzie  Harriet and me. And being the current day  of course  we started our own Facebook group. You're all welcome to join. And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference  she'd gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T shirts. Now why am I telling you this story  and what does this have to do with the future of health  Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross disciplinary  exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness    from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking. What I'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies. We often think linearly. But if you think about it  if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day    two  four  eight        in    days you have       . What do you think you have in a month  We're at a billion. So if we start to think exponentially  we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us. And many of these technologies    speaking as a physician and innovator    we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care  and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today  ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population  the way we really don't use information very well today  the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation. And one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left. We spend most of our money on the last    percent of life. What if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health  leveraging technology as well  Now my favorite technology  example of exponential technology  we all have in our pocket. So if you think about it  these are really dramatically improving. I mean this is the iPhone  . Imagine what the iPhone   will be able to do. Now  I've gained some insight into this. I've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University based in Silicon Valley. And we bring together every summer about     very talented students from around the world. And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine  biotech  artificial intelligence  robotics  nanotechnology  space  and address how can we cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals. We also have seven day executive programs. And coming up next month is actually Future Med  a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine. Now I mentioned the phone. These mobile phones have over        different mobile apps available    to the point where there's one out of the U.K. where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD. I don't know if I'd try that yet  but that's available. There are all other sorts of applications  merging your phone and diagnostics  for example    measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that  potentially  to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic. So let's see now how exponential technologies are taking health care. Let's start with faster. Well it's no secret that computers  through Moore's law  are speeding up faster and faster. We have the ability to do more powerful things with them. They're really approaching  in many cases surpassing  the ability of the human mind. But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging. The ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible. And we're layering multiple technologies    PET scans  CT scans and molecular diagnostics    to find and to seek things at different levels. Here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today  reconstructed of Marc Hodosh  the curator of TEDMED. And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available  and essentially learn how to reconstruct  and maybe even re engineer  or backwards engineer  the brain so we can better understand pathology  disease and therapy. We can look inside with real time fMRI    in the brain at real time. And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections  we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective  for example  psychoactive drugs. The scanners for these are getting small  less expensive and more portable. And this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge. The scan of today takes up about     books  or    gigabytes. The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte  or         books. How do you leverage that information  Let's get personal. I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy  but if you're over age     it's time for your screening colonoscopy. How would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick  Well now there's essentially a virtual colonoscopy. Compare those two pictures  and now as a radiologist  you can essentially fly through your patient's colon and  augmenting that with artificial intelligence  identify potentially  as you see here  a lesion. Oh  we might have missed it  but using A.I. on top of radiology  we can find lesions that were missed before. And maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise. And this is an example of this paradigm shift. We're moving to this integration of biomedicine  information technology  wireless and  I would say  mobile now    this era of digital medicine. So even my stethoscope is now digital. And of course  there's an app for that. We're moving  obviously  to the era of the tricorder. So the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope. These are now at a price point of    what used to be         euros or a couple of hundred thousand dollars    for about       dollars  I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand. And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records    in the United States  we're still less than    percent electronic. Here in the Netherlands  I think it's more than    percent. But now that we're switching to merging medical data  making it available electronically  we can crowd source that information  and now as a physician  I can access my patients' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device. And now  of course  we're in the era of the iPad  even the iPad  . And just last month the first FDA approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices. So certainly  the physicians of today  including myself  are completely reliable on these devices. And as you saw just about a month ago  Watson from IBM beat the two champions in  Jeopardy.  So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years  when we've started to apply this cloud based information  when we really have the A.I. physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done. Already today  you don't need to go to your physician in many cases. Only for about    percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient. We're now in the era of virtual visits    from sort of the Skype type visits you can do with American Well  to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system. The ability to interact with your health care provider is different. And these are being augmented even by our devices again today. Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room    I can do some diagnostics that way. Or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology  like the Microsoft Kinect  and hack that to enable diagnostics  for example  in diagnosing stroke  using simple motion detection  using hundred dollar devices. We can actually now visit our patients robotically    this is the RP   if I'm a hematologist  visit another clinic  visit a hospital. These will be augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now. So imagine we already have wireless scales. You can step on the scale. You can Tweet your weight to your friends  and they can keep you in line. We have wireless blood pressure cuffs. A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together. So instead of wearing these kludgy devices  we can put on a simple patch. This was developed by colleagues at Stanford  called the iRhythm    completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity. Now we're also in the era  today  of quantified self. Consumers now can buy basically hundred dollar devices  like this little FitBit. I can measure my steps  my caloric outtake. I can get insight into that on a daily basis. I can share that with my friends  with my physician. There's watches coming out that will measure your heart rate  the Zeo sleep monitors  a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health. And as we start to integrate this information  we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies  health and wellness. There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate. And I would argue  in the future  we'll have wearable devices in our clothes  monitoring ourselves     . And just like we have the OnStar system in cars  your red light might go on    it won't say  check engine  though. It's going to be  check your body  light  and go in and get it taken care of. Probably in a few years  you'll check into your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you. For those of you with kiddos at home  how would you like to have the wireless diaper that supports your ... too much information  I think  than you might need. But it's going to be here. Now we've heard a lot today about new technology and connection. And I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients  and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine  as augmented by these sorts of technologies. Now we've talked about augmenting the patient  to some degree. How about augmenting the physician  We're now in the era of super enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery  which is here today  at a level that was not really possible even five years ago. Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality. So the surgeon can see inside the patient  through their lens  where the tumor is  where the blood vessels are. This can be integrated with decisions support. A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam  for example. And we're entering an era of really  truly scarless surgery called NOTES  where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically. And this is called NOTES  and this is coming    basically scarless surgery  as mediated by robotic surgery. Now how about controlling other elements  For those who have disabilities    the paraplegic    there's the era of brain computer interface  or BCI  where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or  eventually  a robotic arm. And these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients. Still in clinical trials  but imagine when we can connect these  for example  to the amazing bionic limb  such as the DEKA Arm built by Dean Kamen and colleagues  which has    degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past. So we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually. If you haven't lost a limb    you've had a stroke  for example    you can wear these augmented limbs. Or if you're a paraplegic    like I've visited the folks at Berkley Bionics    they've developed eLEGS. I took this video last week. Here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons. He's otherwise completely wheelchair bound. And now this is the early era of wearable robotics. And I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies  we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability  or super enabling. This is Aimee Mullins  who lost her lower limbs as a young child  and Hugh Herr  who's a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident. And now both of these can climb better  move faster  swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal abled persons. Now how about other exponentials  Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction  including with huge costs. But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller. So a few examples  we're now in the era of  Fantastic Voyage   the iPill. You can swallow this completely integrated device. It can take pictures of your GI system  help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract. We get into even smaller micro robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in a much less invasive manner. Sometimes these might self assemble in your GI system and be augmented in that reality. On the cardiac side  pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them. And they're going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely. These are shrinking even further. Here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny. Artificial retinas  the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see. Again  in early trials  but moving into the future. These are going to be game changing. Or for those of us who are sighted  how about having the assisted living contact lens  BlueTooth  WiFi available    beams back images to your eye. Now if you have trouble maintaining your diet  it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you. How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics  In fact  the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing. We can now leverage microfluidics  like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford. Microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians. Put it on a chip  enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care  anywhere in the world. And this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under served and enable what used to be thousand dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care. If we go down the small pathway a little bit farther  we're entering the era of nanomedicine  the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system  or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries. Now how about exponentially cheaper  Not something we usually think about in the era of medicine  but hard disks used to be       dollars for    megabytes    exponentially cheaper. In genomics now  the genome cost about a billion dollars about    years ago when the first one came out. We're now approaching essentially a thousand dollar genome    probably next year to two years  probably a hundred dollar genome. What are we going to do with hundred dollar genomes  And soon we'll have millions of these tests available. And that's when it gets interesting  when we start to crowdsource that information. And we enter the era of true personalized medicine    the right drug for the right person at the right time    instead of what we're doing today  which is the same drug for everybody    sort of blockbuster drug medications  medications which don't work for you  the individual. And many  many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches. And I'll also show you a simple example  from   andMe again. My data indicates that I've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration  a kind of blindness. But if I take that same data  upload it to deCODEme  I can look at my risk for sample type   diabetes. I'm at almost twice the risk for type   diabetes. I might want to watch how much dessert I have at the lunch break for example. It might change my behavior. Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics    how my genes modulate  what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important  and once in the hands of the individual and the patient  will make better drug dosing and selection available. So again  it's not just genes  it's multiple details    our habits  our environmental exposure. When was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived  Geomedicine  where you've lived  what you've been exposed to  can dramatically affect your health. We can capture that information. So genomics  proteomics  the environment  all this data streaming at us individually and us  as poor physicians  how do we manage it  Well we're now entering the era of systems medicine  or systems biology  where we can start to integrate all of this information. And by looking at the patterns  for example  in our blood of        biomarkers in a single test  we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage. This has been called by Lee Hood  the father of the field  P  medicine. We're going to be predictive  we're going to know what you're likely to have. We can be preventative  that prevention can be personalized  and more importantly  it's going to become increasingly participatory. Through websites like Patients Like Me or managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health  leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important. So I'll finish up with exponentially better. We'd like to get therapies better and more effective. Now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills. What if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension  This is a new device that is essentially doing that. It should be on the market within a year or two. How about more targeted therapies for cancer  Right  I'm an oncologist and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison. We've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells  the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse. So if you think of cancer as a weed  we often can whack the weed away. It seems to shrink  but it often comes back. So we're attacking the wrong target. The cancer stem cells remain  and the tumor can return months or years later. We're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure. And we're entering the era of personalized oncology  the ability to leverage all of this data together  analyze the tumor and come up with a real  specific cocktail for the individual patient. Now I'll close with regenerative medicine. So I've studied a lot about stem cells    embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful. We also have adult stem cells throughout our body. We use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation. Geron  just last year  started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries. Still a Phase I trial  but evolving. We've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about    years to approach a whole range of topics  particularly in cardiovascular disease. We take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack  we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack. I invented a device called the MarrowMiner  a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow. It's now been FDA approved  and it'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so. Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient's body and removing the patient's bone marrow  instead of with     punctures  with just a single puncture under local anesthesia. But where is stem cell therapy really going  If you think about it  every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo. We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient    making your own personalized stem cell lines. And I think they'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells  myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future  should you need them. And we're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering  and integrating exponential technologies for essentially  D organ printing    replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a  D organ. That's where things are going to head    still very early days. But I think  as integration of exponential technologies  this is the example. So in close  as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine  we're entering an era of miniaturization  decentralization and personalization. And I think by pulling these things together  if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these  we're going to empower the patient  enable the doctor  enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick. Because I know as a doctor  if someone comes to me with Stage I disease  I'm thrilled    we can often cure them. But often it's too late and it's Stage III or IV cancer  for example. So by leveraging these technologies together  I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call Stage   medicine. And as a cancer doctor  I'm looking forward to being out of a job. Thanks very much. Host  Thank you. Thank you. Take a bow. Take a bow. I'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background. I was in my   s before I ever went to an art museum. I grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural Arkansas  an hour from the nearest movie theater. And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist because I grew up around quirky  colorful characters who were great at making with their hands. And my childhood is more hick than I could ever possibly relate to you  and also more intellectual than you would ever expect. For instance  me and my sister  when we were little  we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains. But on the other side of that  though  we were big readers in our house. And if the TV was on  we were watching a documentary. And my dad is the most voracious reader I know. He can read a novel or two a day. But when I was little  I remember  he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun. And what was so amazing to me about that    well he would be in his recliner  would holler for me to fetch the BB gun  and I'd go get it. And what was amazing to me    well it was pretty kickass  he was killing a fly in the house with a gun    but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it. And he could shoot it from two rooms away and not damage what it was on because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly and not damage what it landed on. So I should talk about art. Or we'll be here all day with my childhood stories. I love contemporary art  but I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene. A few years ago  I spent months in Europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world. And I was struck by going to so many  one after the other  with some clarity of what it was that I was longing for. And I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting  or not getting enough of. But two of the main things  one of it  I was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public  that was accessible. And the second thing that I was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship and technique. So I started thinking and listing what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial. So I decided  I'm going to start my own biennial. I'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world. So I thought  okay  I have to have some criteria of how to choose work. So amongst all the criteria I have  there's two main things. One of them  I call my Mimaw's Test. And what that is is I imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes  and if I can't explain it in five minutes  then it's too obtuse or esoteric and it hasn't been refined enough yet. It needs to worked on until it can speak fluently. And then my other second set of rules    I hate to say  rules  because it's art    my criteria would be the three H's  which is head  heart and hands. And great art would have  head   it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts. It would have  heart  in that it would have passion and heart and soul. And it would have  hand  in that it would be greatly crafted. So I started thinking about how am I going to do this biennial  how am I going to travel the world and find these artists  And then I realized one day  there's an easier solution to this. I'm just going to make the whole thing myself. And so this is what I did. So I thought  a biennial needs artists. I'm going to do an international biennial  I need artists from all around the world. So what I did was I invented a hundred artists from around the world. I figured out their bios  their passions in life and their art styles  and I started making their work. I felt  oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing. So I decided  I'm going to make this a real biennial. It's going to be two years of studio work. And I'm going to create this in two years  and I have. So I should start to talk about these guys. Well the range is quite a bit. And I'm such a technician  so I loved this project  getting to play with all the techniques. So for example  in realist paintings  it ranges from this  which is kind of old masters style  to really realistic still life  to this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair. And then at the other end  there's performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation and this one  and outdoor installations like this one and this one. I know I should mention  I'm making all these things. This isn't Photoshopped. I'm under the river with those fish. So now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you. This is Nell Remmel. Nell is interested in agricultural processes  and her work is based in these practices. This piece  which is called  Flipped Earth     she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground. And by taking giant mirrors    and here she's taking giant mirrors and pulling them into the dirt. And this is    feet long. And what I loved about her work is  when I would walk around it and look down into the sky  looking down to watch the sky  and it unfolded in a new way. And probably the best part of this piece is at dusk and dawn when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark  but there's still the light above  bright above. And so you're standing there and everything else is dark  but there's this portal that you want to jump in. This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas. And I love to dig a hole. So this piece was great fun because it was two days of digging in soft dirt. The next artist is Kay Overstry  and she's interested in ephemerality and transience. And in her most recent project  it's called  Weather I Made.  And she's making weather on her body's scale. And this piece is  Frost.  And what she did was she went out on a cold  dry night and breathed back and forth on the lawn to leave    to leave her life's mark  the mark of her life. And so this is five foot  five inches of frost that she left behind. The sun rises  and it melts away. And that was played by my mom. So the next artist  this is a group of Japanese artists  a collective of Japanese artists    in Tokyo. And they were interested in developing a new  alternative art space  and they needed funding for it  so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects. One of these is scratch off masterpieces. And so what they're doing    each of these artists on a nine by seven inch card  which they sell for    bucks  they drew original works of art. And you buy one  and maybe you get a real piece  and maybe not. Well this has sparked a craze in Japan  because everyone's wanting a masterpiece. And the ones that are the most sought after are the ones that are only barely scratched off. And all these works  in some way  talk about luck or fate or chance. Those first two are portraits of mega jackpot winners years before and after their win. And in this one it's called  Drawing the Short Stick.  I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home who introduced me    which I think is such a great introduction    to a friend one day as   This is my cousin Shea. He draws sticks real good.  Which is one of the best compliments ever. This artist is Gus Weinmueller  and he's doing a project  a large project  called  Art for the Peoples.  And within this project  he's doing a smaller project called  Artists in Residence.  And what he does is    he spends a week at a time with a family. And he shows up on their porch  their doorstep  with a toothbrush and pajamas  and he's ready to spend the week with them. And using only what's present  he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of. And he spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is. He has all these discussions with their family  and he digs through everything they have  and he finds materials to make work. And he makes a work that answers what they think great art is. For this family  he made this still life painting. And whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property. This next project  this is by Jaochim Parisvega  and he's interested in    he believes art is everywhere waiting    that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen. And he provides this push by harnessing natural forces  like in his series where he used rain to make paintings. This project is called  Love Nests.  What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him. So he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them  and they crafted his nests for him. And this one's called  Lovelock's Nest.  This one's called  Mixtape Love Song's Nest.  And this one's called  Lovemaking Nest.  Next is Sylvia Slater. Sylvia's interested in art training. She's a very serious Swiss artist. And she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos ridden places and developing countries  and she was thinking  what can I make that would be of value to them  in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman  And so she came up with creating these pocket sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them. And you would carry this around with you  and if everything went to hell  you could make payments and buy your life. So this life price is for an irrigation non profit director. So hopefully what happens is you never use it  and it's an heirloom that you pass down. And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments  or they could be like these  which are leaves that can be payments. And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones. And this one had to get broken up. He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently. This is by a duo  Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland. And they're interested in creating culture  just tradition. So what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area. So this is in Eastern Tennessee  and what they decided was that we need a positive tradition that goes with death. So they came up with  dig jigs.  And a dig jig    a dig jig is where  for a milestone anniversary or a birthday  you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you're going to be buried. And we got a lot of attention when we did it. I talked my family into doing this  and they didn't know what I was doing. And I was like   Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work.  And so we got to the grave and made this  which was hilarious    the attention that we got. So what happens is you dance on the grave  and after you've done your dance  everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are. And you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for. That's my mom and dad. This is by Jason Birdsong. He is interested in how we see as an animal  how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage. You know  we look down a dark alley or a jungle path  trying to make out a face or a creature. We just have that natural way of seeing. And he plays with this idea. And this piece  those aren't actually leaves. They're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage. So he pairs these up. There's another pile of leaves. Those are actually all real butterfly specimens. And he pairs these up with paintings. Like this is a painting of a snake in a box. So you open the box and you think   Whoa  there's a snake in there.  But it's actually a painting. So he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage. The next artist is Hazel Clausen. Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided   You know  I would learn a lot about culture if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch.  So that's what she did. She created the Swiss people named the Uvulites  and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for. And also they reference how the uvula    everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit. And that's the symbol of their culture. And this is from a documentary called  Sexual Practices and Populations Control Among the Uvulites.  This is a typical angora embroidery for them. This is one of their founders  Gert Schaeffer. And actually this is my Aunt Irene. It was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things. And I crack up at this piece  because when I see it I know that's French angora and all antique German ribbons and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill and carried around for    years and then antique Chinese skirts. The next is a collective of artists called the Silver Dobermans  and their motto is to spread pragmatism one person at a time. And they're really interested in how over coddled we've become. So this is one of their comments on how over coddled we've become. And what they've done is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence. And this is called  Horse Sense Fence.  The next artist is K. M. Yoon  a really interesting South Korean artist. And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition of scholar stones. Next is Maynard Sipes. And I love Maynard Sipes  but he's off in his own world  and  bless his heart  he's so paranoid. Next is Roy Penig  a really interesting Kentucky artist  and he's the nicest guy. He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly. Next is an Australian artist  Janeen Jackson  and this is from a project of hers called  What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching.  Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller  Jurgi Petrauskas. Next is Ginger Cheshire. This is from a short film of hers called  The Last Person.  And that's my cousin and my sister's dog  Gabby. The next  this is by Sam Sandy. He's an Australian Aboriginal elder  and he's also an artist. And this is from a large traveling sculpture project that he's doing. This is from Estelle Willoughsby. She heals with color. And she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists  even though she's going to be    next year. This is by Z. Zhou  and he's interested in stasis. Next is by Hilda Singh  and she's doing a whole project called  Social Outfits.  Next is by Vera Sokolova. And I have to say  Vera kind of scares me. You can't look her directly in the eyes because she's kind of scary. And it's good that she's not real  she'd be mad that I said that. And she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg  and she plays with optics. Next  this is by Thomas Swifton. This is from a short film   Adventures with Skinny.  And this is by Cicily Bennett  and it's from a series of short films. And after this one  there's    other artists. And all together with those other    you're not seeing  that's my biennial. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. I'm here today to start a revolution. Now before you get up in arms  or you break into song  or you pick a favorite color  I want to define what I mean by revolution. By revolution  I mean a drastic and far reaching change in the way we think and behave    the way we think and the way we behave. Now why  Steve  why do we need a revolution  We need a revolution because things aren't working  they're just not working. And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working. You know  I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential. I'm sick and tired of us being last. And we are last place in so many things    for example  social factors. We're last place in Europe in innovation. There we are right at the end  right at the bottom  last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation. We're last place in health care  and that's important for a sense of well being. And there we are  not just last in the E.U.  we're last in Europe  at the very bottom. And worst of all  it just came out three weeks ago  many of you have seen it  The Economist. We're the saddest place on Earth  relative to GDP per capita    the saddest place on Earth. That's social. Let's look at education. Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD  Last in reading  math and science. Last. Business  The lowest perception in the E.U. that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society. Why as a result  what happens  The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses. And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies. We hire the most people  we create the most taxes. So if our engine's broken  guess what  Last in Europe GDP per capita. Last. So it's no surprise  guys  that    percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future. We're unhappy  we have bad education  and we have the worst businesses. And these are facts  guys. This isn't story tale  it's not make believe. It's not. It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts. So I think it should be really  really clear that our system is broken. The way we think  the way we behave  our operating system of behaving is broken. We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better  for ourselves  for our friends  for our family and for our future. How did this happen  Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen  I think we're last because    and this is going to be drastic to some of you    because we are handicapping ourselves. We're holding ourselves back because we don't value play. I said  play   all right. In case some of you forgot what play is  this is what play looks like. Babies play  kids play  adults play. We don't value play. In fact  we devalue play. And we devalue it in three areas. Let's go back to the same three areas. Social     years of what  Of communism    of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing  inadvertently  creativity  individual self expression and innovation. And instead  what do we value  Because it's shown the way we apply  generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context  which told us what in communism  To be serious. To be really  really serious. It did. Be serious. I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground. Heaven forbid they play in the dirt  the kal  or even worse  lokvi  water    that will kill them. I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life. We have a serious meme running through. It's a social gene running through us. It's a serious gene. It's    years of it that's created what I call the  baba factor.  And here's how it works. Step one  woman says   I want to have a baby. Iskam baby.  Step two  we get the baby. Woohoo  But then what happens in step three  I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees. I'm going to give bebko to baba. But we need to remember that baba's been infected by the serious meme for    years. So what happens  She passes that virus on to baby  and it takes a really  really  really long time    as the redwood trees    for that serious meme to get out of our operating system. What happens then  It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for     years  that values rote learning  memorization and standardization  and devalues self expression  self exploration  questioning  creativity and play. It's a crap system. True story  I went looking for a school for my kid. We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math    times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff. And we said   Well what about play and recess   And they said   Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule.  And we said   He's five.  What a crime. What a crime. And it's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we're creating mindless  robotic workers to put bolts in pre drilled holes. But I'm sorry  the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution. We need adaptability  the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative. We don't need mechanized workers. But no  now our meme goes into work where we don't value play. We create robotic workers that we treat like assets  to lever and just throw away. What are qualities of a Bulgarian work  Autocratic    do what I say because I'm the chef. I'm the boss and I know better than you. Untrusting    you're obviously a criminal  so I'm going to install cameras. Controlling    you're obviously an idiot  so I'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box. So they're restrictive    don't use your mobile phone  don't use your laptop  don't search the Internet  don't be on I.M. That's somehow unprofessional and bad. And at the end of the day  it's unfulfilling because you're controlled  you're restricted  you're not valued and you're not having any fun. In social  in education and in our business  don't value play. And that's why we're last  because we don't value play. And you can say   That's ridiculous  Steve. What a dumb idea. It can't be because of play. Just play  that's a stupid thing.  We have the serious meme in us. Well I'm going to say no. And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech    that play is the catalyst  it is the revolution  that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better. Play  our brains are hardwired for play. Evolution has selected  over millions and billions of years  for play in animals and in humans. And you know what  Evolution does a really  really good job of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage. Nature isn't stupid  and it selected for play. Throughout the animal kingdom  for example  ants. Ants play. Maybe you didn't know that. But when they're playing  they're learning the social order and dynamics of things. Rats play  but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better  skills. Kittens play. We all know kittens play. But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially. They can still hunt  but they can't be social. Bears play. But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer. It's not the bears that learn how to fish better. It's the ones that play more. And a final really interesting study    it's been shown  a correlation between play and brain size. The more you play  the bigger the brains there are. Dolphins  pretty big brains  play a lot. But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players  Yours truly  humans. Kids play  we play    of every nationality  of every race  of every color  of every religion. It's a universal thing    we play. And it's not just kids  it's adults too. Really cool term  neoteny    the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults. And who are the biggest neotenists  Humans. We play sports. We do it for fun  or as Olympians  or as professionals. We play musical instruments. We dance  we kiss  we sing  we just goof around. We're designed by nature to play from birth to old age. We're designed to do that continuously    to play and play a lot and not stop playing. It is a huge benefit. Just like there's benefits to animals  there's benefits to humans. For example  it's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala  in the area where it controls emotions. It's been shown to promote pre frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening. As a result  what happens  We develop more emotional maturity if we play more. We develop better decision making ability if we play more. These guys are facts. It's not fiction  it's not story tales  it's not make believe  it's cold  hard science. These are the benefits to play. It is a genetic birthright that we have  like walking or speaking or seeing. And if we handicap ourselves with play  we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have. We hold ourselves back. Little exercise just for a second  close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play. Imagine a world without theater  without the arts  without song  without dancing  without soccer  without football  without laughter. What does this world look like  It's pretty bleak. It's pretty glum. Now imagine your workplace. Is it fun  Is it playful  Or maybe the workplace of your friends    here we're forward thinking. Is it fun  Is it playful  Or is it crap  Is it autocratic  controlling  restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling  We have this concept that the opposite of play is work. We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.  Oh  my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work   or   Oh  I've got to hide because my boss might see me. He's going to think I'm not working hard.  But I have news for you  our thinking is backwards. The opposite of play is not work. The opposite of play is depression. It's depression. In fact  play improves our work. Just like there's benefits for humans and animals  there's benefits for play at work. For example  it stimulates creativity. It increases our openness to change. It improves our ability to learn. It provides a sense of purpose and mastery    two key motivational things that increase productivity  through play. So before you start thinking of play as just not serious  play doesn't mean frivolous. You know  the professional athlete that loves skiing  he's serious about it  but he loves it. He's having fun  he's in the groove  he's in the flow. A doctor might be serious  but laughter's still a great medicine. Our thinking is backwards. We shouldn't be feeling guilty. We should be celebrating play. Quick example from the corporate world. FedEx  easy motto  people  service  profit. If you treat your people like people  if you treat them great  they're happier  they're fulfilled  they have a sense of mastery and purpose. What happens  They give better service    not worse  but better. And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled  how do the customers feel  They feel great. And what do great customers do  great feeling customers  They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends  which leads to more profit. People  service  profit. Play increases productivity  not decreases. And you're going to say   Gee  that can work for FedEx out there in the United States  but it can't work in Bulgaria. No way. We're different.  It does work in Bulgaria  you guys. Two reasons. One  play is universal. There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play  besides the serious meme that we have to kick out. Two  I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant. When I got there  we had zero happy customers. Not one customer would refer us. I asked them all. We had marginal profit    I did. We had marginal profits  and we had unhappy stakeholders. Through some basic change  change like improving transparency  change like promoting self direction and collaboration  encouraging collaboration  not autocracy  the things like having a results focus. I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave. I care that your customer and your team is happy and you're organized with that. Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock  Basically promoting fun. Through promoting fun and a great environment  we were able to transform Sciant and  in just three short years    sounds like a long time  but change is slow    every customer  from zero to every customer referring us  above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders. And you can say   Well how do you know they're happy   Well we did win  every year that we entered  one of the rankings for best employer for small business. Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys. It does  and it can  work in Bulgaria. There's nothing holding us back  except our own mentality about play. So some steps that we can take    to finish up    how to make this revolution through play. First of all  you have to believe me. If you don't believe me  well just go home and think about it some more or something. Second of all  if you don't have the feeling of play in you  you need to rediscover play. Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy  that you enjoyed only six months ago  but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy  because you feel like you have to be serious  rediscover it. I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game. Rediscover that because you're the leaders  the innovation leaders  the thought leaders. You're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution. You guys have to  and if you're not feeling it  your colleagues  your employees  aren't going to feel it. You've got to go back and say   Hey  I'm going to trust you.  Weird concept  I hired you  I should trust you. I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you  and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level  rather than the top. I'm going to encourage constructive criticism. I'm going to let you challenge authority. Because it's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today. We're not always right as leaders. We're going to eradicate fear. Fear is the enemy of play. And we're going to do things like eliminate restrictions. You know what  let them use their mobile phone for personal calls    heaven forbid. Let them be on the Internet. Let them be on instant messengers. Let them take long lunches. Lunch is like the recess for work. It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain  you meet your friends  you have a beer  you have some food  you talk  you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn't have had before. Let them do it. Give them some freedom  and in general  let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace. We spend so much of our lives at the workplace  and it's supposed to be  what  a miserable grind  so that    years from now  we wake up and say   Is this it  Is that all there was   Unacceptable. Nepriemliv. So in summary  we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave  but we don't need a workers' revolution. We don't need a workers' revolution. What we need is a players' uprising. What we need is a players' uprising. What we need is a players' uprising. Seriously  we need to band together. Today is the start of the uprising. But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution. You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives  our schools  and our work with play  about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment  of how play promotes innovation and productivity  and  ultimately  how play creates meaning. Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together  and together  if we do this and share these ideas on play  we can transform Bulgaria for the better. Thank you. As an artist  connection is very important to me. Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected. I first went to Antarctica almost    years ago  where I saw my first icebergs. I was in awe. My heart beat fast  my head was dizzy  trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me. The icebergs around me were almost     feet out of the water  and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake  year after year. Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves. Each iceberg has its own individual personality. They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end  while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion. It's easy to think  when you look at an iceberg  that they're isolated  that they're separate and alone  much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves. But the reality is far from it. As an iceberg melts  I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere. As the iceberg melts  it is releasing mineral rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life. I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors  knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again. It is not a death when they melt  it is not an end  but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life. Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young    a couple thousand years old. And some of the ice is over         years old. The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq  Greenland. It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling. So here it is. You can see on the left side a small boat. That's about a    foot boat. And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline. You can see here  it begins to roll  and the boat has moved to the other side  and the man is standing there. This is an average size Greenlandic iceberg. It's about     feet above the water  or    meters. And this video is real time. And just like that  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality. Thank you. By birth and by choice  I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life  and for the past    years  I've worked at Ford Motor Company. And for most of those years  I worried about  how am I going to sell more cars and trucks  But today I worry about  what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks  What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles  triples  or even quadruples  My life is guided by two great passions  and the first is automobiles. I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company. I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway. And I decided about that time  about age     that it would be really cool if I was a test driver. So my parents would go to dinner. They'd sit down  I'd sneak out of the house. I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway  and it was a blast. And that went on for about two years  until    I think I was about       my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III. And it was snowing that day. So he and mom went to dinner  and I snuck out and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure eights in the snow. My dad finished dinner early that evening. And he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car    and almost ended up in the front hall. So it kind of cooled my test driving for a little while. But I really began to love cars then. And my first car was a      electric green Mustang. And even though the color was pretty hideous  I did love the car  and it really cemented my love affair with cars that's continued on to this day. But cars are really more than a passion of mine  they're quite literally in my blood. My great grandfather was Henry Ford  and on my mother's side  my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone. So when I was born  I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me. But my great grandfather  Henry Ford  really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them. Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress. And that's a belief that I share. My other great passion is the environment. And as a young boy  I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about. And it really struck me as the years went by  in a very negative way  when I would go to some stream that I'd loved  and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies  and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it. And so even at a young age  that really resonated with me  and the whole notion of environmental preservation  at a very basic level  sunk in with me. As a high schooler  I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey  and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world. But it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature. And that was true until I got to college. And when I got to college  you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country. They thought that we were more interested  as an industry  in profits  rather than progress  and that we filled the skies with smog    and frankly  we were the enemy. I joined Ford after college  after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do. But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there. And as I look back over    years ago  it was a little naive to think at that age that I could. But I wanted to. And I really discovered that my professors weren't completely wrong. In fact  when I got back to Detroit  my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced by those in my own company  and certainly by those in the industry. I had some very interesting conversations  as you can imagine. There were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with  environmental wackos.  I was considered a radical. And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists. Of course  I had no intention of doing that  and I kept speaking out about the environment  and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability. And in time  my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today. I mean  I think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it. And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues  of cars and the environment    not only at Ford  but really as an industry. We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights. And with new technology  we're reducing    and I believe  someday we'll eliminate    CO  emissions. We're starting to sell electric cars  which is great. We're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word    economically  socially and environmentally. And actually  although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do  I can see the day where my two great passions    cars and the environment    actually come into harmony. But unfortunately  as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem    and as I said  we're not there yet  we've got a lot of work to do  but I can see where we will    but even as we're in the process of doing that  another huge problem is looming  and people aren't noticing. And that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened  just as the environment is. The problem  put in its simplest terms  is one of mathematics. Today there are approximately  .  billion people in the world  and within our lifetime  that number's going to grow to about nine billion. And at that population level  our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth. And with that growth comes some severe practical problems  one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with it. When we look at the population growth in terms of cars  it becomes even clearer. Today there are about     million cars on the road worldwide. But with more people and greater prosperity around the world  that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century. And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before. Now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives. Today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams  and that's a huge waste of time and resources. But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest. Today the average driver in Beijing has a five hour commute. And last summer    many of you probably saw this    there was a hundred mile traffic jam that took    days to clear in China. In the decades to come     percent of the world's population will live in cities  and    of those cities will be of    million people or more. So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing. When you factor in population growth  it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow. Frankly  four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars  and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam. So  if we make no changes today  what does tomorrow look like  Well I think you probably already have the picture. Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge  and they're really very  very inconvenient  but that's all they are. But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care  particularly to people that live in city centers. And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised. So what's going to solve this  Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same. My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T   If I had asked people then what they wanted  they would have answered  'We want faster horses.'  So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads. When America began moving west  we didn't add more wagon trains  we built railroads. And to connect our country after World War II  we didn't build more two lane highways  we built the interstate highway system. Today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future. We are going to build smart cars  but we also need to build smart roads  smart parking  smart public transportation systems and more. We don't want to waste our time sitting in traffic  sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots. We need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers. And frankly  that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable. Now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world. The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another  and they go underneath the city streets. And up above  you've got a series of pedestrian walkways. On New York City's   th Street  gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle specific corridors. Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created  and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about    minutes. Now if you look at Hong Kong  they have a very interesting system called Octopus there. It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system. So parking garages  buses  trains  they all operate within the same system. Now shared car services are also springing up around the world  and these efforts  I think  are great. They're relieving congestion  and they're frankly starting to save some fuel. These are all really good ideas that will move us forward. But what really inspires me is what's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other. Very soon  the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network. Every morning I drive about    miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn  Michigan. And every night I go home  my commute is a total crapshoot. And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home. But very soon we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other. So if the car ahead of me on I    hits traffic  it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way. And these systems are being tested right now  and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon. But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless. So just imagine  one day very soon  you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system. So you get in your car  and as you get in your car  your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive    no more driving around looking for one  which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars in urban areas    is looking for parking spots. Or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one. Or being at a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time. This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system. So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem. But as we found out with addressing CO  issues  and also fossil fuels  there is no one silver bullet. The solution is not going to be more cars  more roads or a new rail system  it can only be found  I believe  in a global network of interconnected solutions. Now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work  but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions    whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet  our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options. We need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue. Companies  entrepreneurs  venture capitalists  they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity  as well as an enormous social problem. And just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge    and it's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power  how much money and how much serious thought has  really over the last three years  just poured into the green energy field. We need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock. But we need people like all of you in this room  leading thinkers. I mean  frankly  I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue. And we need people from all walks of life  not just inventors  we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge. This isn't going to be solved by any one person or one group. It's going to really require a national energy policy  frankly for each country  because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels  traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are. But we need to get going  and we need to get going today. And we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future. You know  we've come a long way. Since the Model T  most people never traveled more than    miles from home in their entire lifetime. And since then  the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live  where we work  where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around. We don't want to regress and lose that freedom. We're on our way to solving    and as I said earlier  I know we've got a long way to go    the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it  and that's the environmental issue  but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock. Because in doing so  we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted  which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world. And it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this. Because  if you can envision  as I do  a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today  that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow. I believe we're at our best when we're confronted with big issues. This is a big one  and it won't wait. So let's get started now. Thank you. I'm a savant  or more precisely  a high functioning autistic savant. It's a rare condition. And rarer still when accompanied  as in my case  by self awareness and a mastery of language. Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me  there's a certain kind of awkwardness. I can see it in their eyes. They want to ask me something. And in the end  quite often  the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out   If I give you my date of birth  can you tell me what day of the week I was born on   Or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text. I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one man savant show for you today. I'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots    a little deeper and a lot closer  to my mind  than work. I want to talk to you briefly about perception. When he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name  Anton Chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him    little details that other people seem to miss. Every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life  I'm reminded of why I too became a writer. In my books  I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding. Here are three questions drawn from my work. Rather than try to figure them out  I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them. For example  the calculation  can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall  Or look at the foreign word and the sounds  can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards  And in terms of the line of poetry  why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit  I'm asking you to do this because I believe our personal perceptions  you see  are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge. Aesthetic judgments  rather than abstract reasoning  guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know. I'm an extreme example of this. My worlds of words and numbers blur with color  emotion and personality. As Juan said  it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia  an unusual cross talk between the senses. Here are the numbers one to    as I see them    every number with its own shape and character. One is a flash of white light. Six is a tiny and very sad black hole. The sketches are in black and white here  but in my mind they have colors. Three is green. Four is blue. Five is yellow. I paint as well. And here is one of my paintings. It's a multiplication of two prime numbers. Three dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape  the answer to the sum. What about bigger numbers  Well you can't get much bigger than Pi  the mathematical constant. It's an infinite number    literally goes on forever. In this painting that I made of the first    decimals of Pi  I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape. But it's not only numbers that I see in colors. Words too  for me  have colors and emotions and textures. And this is an opening phrase from the novel  Lolita.  And Nabokov was himself synesthetic. And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out. Another example  a little bit more mathematical. And I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from  The Great Gatsby.  There is a procession of syllables    wheat  one  prairies  two  lost Swede towns  three    one  two  three. And this effect is very pleasant on the mind  and it helps the sentence to feel right. Let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago.    multiplied by   . If some of you play chess  you'll know that    is a square number  and that's why chessboards  eight by eight  have    squares. So that gives us a form that we can picture  that we can perceive. What about     Well if      if we think of     as being like a square     would look like this. So what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind    something like this.    becomes      . And in the right hand corner  you don't have to calculate anything. Four across  four up and down    it's   . So what the sum is actually asking you to do is           . That's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math  I'm sure. It's                                 the answer to the sum. Easy when you know how. The second question was an Icelandic word. I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic. So let me narrow the choices down to two. Hnugginn  is it a happy word  or a sad word  What do you say  Okay. Some people say it's happy. Most people  a majority of people  say sad. And it actually means sad. Why do  statistically  a majority of people say that a word is sad  in this case  heavy in other cases  In my theory  language evolves in such a way that sounds match  correspond with  the subjective  with the personal  intuitive experience of the listener. Let's have a look at the third question. It's a line from a poem by John Keats. Words  like numbers  express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world. It stands to reason that we  existing in this world  should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships. And poets  like other artists  play with those intuitive understandings. In the case of hare  it's an ambiguous sound in English. It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head. And if we think of that    let me put the picture up    the fibers represent vulnerability. They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion. So what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension. The hare itself  the animal    not a cat  not a dog  a hare    why a hare  Because think of the picture    not the word  the picture. The overlong ears  the overlarge feet  helps us to picture  to feel intuitively  what it means to limp and to tremble. So in these few minutes  I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions  numbers  shapes and personalities. The world is richer  vaster than it too often seems to be. I hope that I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes. Thank you. You know  what I do is write for children  and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author  in fact. And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist. You can have me as a farmer  or in leathers  and no one has ever chose farmer. I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies. And you know  an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace. You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany. That's a painting of a circle. A friend of mine did that    Richard Bollingbroke. It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about. My circle began back in the '  s in high school in Stow  Ohio where I was the class queer. I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room  until one teacher saved my life. She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge. She did it in secret. She did it for three years. And I had to get out of town. I had a thumb  I had    dollars  and I ended up in San Francisco  California    met a lover    and back in the '  s  found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations. About three or four years ago  I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher  Mrs. Posten  who said   I need to see you. I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. Could you please come to Ohio  and please bring that man that I know you have found by now. And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer  and I'd like you to please be quick about this.  Well  the next day we were in Cleveland. We took a look at her  we laughed  we cried  and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice. We found her one  we got her there  and we took care of her and watched over her family  because it was necessary. It's something we knew how to do. And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me  she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands. And what had happened was the circle had closed  it had become a circle    and that epiphany I talked about presented itself. The epiphany is that death is a part of life. She saved my life  I and my partner saved hers. And you know  that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does. It needs truth and beauty  and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today. It also needs    it needs dignity  love and pleasure  and it's our job to hand those things out. Thank you. Space  we all know what it looks like. We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives  from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space  we have no sense of what space sounds like. And indeed  most people associate space with silence. But the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking. And yet despite this  hardly any of us have ever heard space. How many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star  Well in case you've ever wondered  this is what the Sun sounds like. This is the planet Jupiter. And this is the space probe Cassini pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn. This is a a highly condensed clump of neutral matter  spinning in the distant universe. So my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe. And you may wonder  how do we know what these sounds are  How can we tell the difference between the sound of the Sun and the sound of a pulsar  Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy. Radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers  which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky. And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth  we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques. And therefore  it's through listening that we've come to uncover some of the universe's most important secrets    its scale  what it's made of and even how old it is. So today  I'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening. It's punctuated by three quick anecdotes  which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space. Now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft  but a rather more humble technology    and in fact  the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today  the telephone. It's       it's in Boston  and this is Alexander Graham Bell who was working with Thomas Watson on the invention of the telephone. A key part of their technical set up was a half mile long length of wire  which was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in Boston. The line carried the telephone signals that would later make Bell a household name. But like any long length of charged wire  it also inadvertently became an antenna. Thomas Watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected. Now you have to remember  this is    years before Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves       years before Nikola Tesla's four tuned circuit    nearly    years before Marconi's first broadcast. So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us. We didn't have the technology to transmit. So what were these strange noises  Watson was in fact listening to very low frequency radio emissions caused by nature. Some of the crackles and pops were lightning  but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin. Using the very first telephone  Watson was in fact dialed into the heavens. As he correctly guessed  some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the Sun. It was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to    a phenomena which we can see at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet as the aurora. So whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution  Watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves. He had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them. Fast forward    years  and Bell and Watson's technology has completely transformed global communications. But going from slinging some wire across rooftops in Boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the Atlantic Ocean seabed is no easy matter. And so before long  Bell were looking to new technologies to optimize their revolution. Radio could carry sound without wires. But the medium is lossy    it's subject to a lot of noise and interference. So Bell employed an engineer to study those noises  to try and find out where they came from  with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec  which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony. Most of the noises that the engineer  Karl Jansky  investigated were fairly prosaic in origin. They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power. But there was one persistent noise that Jansky couldn't identify  and it seemed to appear in his radio headset four minutes earlier each day. Now any astronomer will tell you  this is the telltale sign of something that doesn't originate from Earth. Jansky had made a historic discovery  that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves. Fifty years on from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun  Jansky's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration  the radio astronomy age. Over the next few years  astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers and learned about our radio sky  about Jupiter and the Sun  by listening. Let's jump ahead again. It's       and we're back at Bell Labs. And once again  two scientists have got a problem with noise. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were using the horn antenna at Bell's Holmdel laboratory to study the Milky Way with extraordinary precision. They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity. There was a glitch in their soundtrack. A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research. It was in the microwave range  and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously. Now this didn't make any sense  and like any reasonable engineer or scientist  they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself  it must be the dish. There were pigeons roosting in the dish. And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings  get the disk kind of operational again  normal operations would resume. But the noise didn't disappear. The mysterious noise that Penzias and Wilson were listening to turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound that anyone had ever heard. It was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe. This was the first experimental evidence that the Big Bang existed and the universe was born at a precise moment some   .  billion years ago. So our story ends at the beginning    the beginning of all things  the Big Bang. This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard    the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear  the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang. Thanks. My name is Joshua Walters. I'm a performer. But as far as being a performer  I'm also diagnosed bipolar. I reframe that as a positive because the crazier I get onstage  the more entertaining I become. When I was    in San Francisco  I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ. Maybe you thought that was scary  but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ. I was sent to a place  a psych ward  and in the psych ward  everyone is doing their own one man show. There's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time. They're just practicing. One day they'll get here. Now when I got out  I was diagnosed and I was given medications by a psychiatrist.  Okay  Josh  why don't we give you some    why don't we give you some Zyprexa. Okay  Mmhmm  At least that's what it says on my pen.  Some of you are in the field  I can see. I can feel your noise. The first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode  and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs  where I was sleeping through high school. The second half was just one big nap  pretty much  in class. When I got out I had a choice. I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness. There's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive    at least the hypomanic edge part of it. Now if you don't know what hypomania is  it's like an engine that's out of control  maybe a Ferrari engine  with no breaks. Many of the speakers here  many of you in the audience  have that creative edge  if you know what I'm talking about. You're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible. And there's a book    John Gartner. John Gartner wrote this book called  The Hypomanic Edge  in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete. A different book was written not too long ago in the mid   s called  Touched With Fire  by Kay Redfield Jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with. Some of them committed suicide. So it wasn't all the good side of the illness. Now recently  there's been development in this field. And there was an article written in the New York Times  September       that stated   Just Manic Enough.  Just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum    you know what I'm talking about    not maybe full bipolar  but they're in the bipolar spectrum    where on one side  maybe you think you're Jesus  and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money. Your call. Your call. And everyone's somewhere in the middle. Everyone's somewhere in the middle. So maybe  you know  there's no such thing as crazy  and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy. But maybe it just means you're more sensitive to what most people can't see or feel. Maybe no one's really crazy. Everyone is just a little bit mad. How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum. How much depends on how lucky you are. Thank you. My name is Emiliano Salinas and I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now. I was born in     . I grew up in a traditional Mexican family. As a child  I had a pretty normal life  I would go to school  play with my friends and cousins. But then my father became President of Mexico and my life changed. What I'm about to say  at least some of what I'm about to say  will cause controversy. Firstly  because I'm the one who's going to say it. And secondly  because what I'm going to say is true  and it will make a lot of people nervous because it's something we don't want to hear. But it's imperative that we listen because it's undeniable and definitive. It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons. I'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon  and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence. I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son from the fact that I'm a citizen concerned about the country's current situation. Don't worry. It's not necessary for understanding the importance of what I'm going to say. I think we have a problem in Mexico. We have a big problem. I think there's consensus on this. No one argues    we all agree there's a problem. What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is. Is it the Zetas  The drug traffickers  The government  Corruption  Poverty  Or is it something else  I think none of these is the problem. I don't mean they don't deserve attention. But we won't be able to take care of any of those things if we don't solve the real problem we have in Mexico first. The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans  we believe we are victims of our circumstances. We are a country of victims. Historically  we've always acted as victims of something or somebody. We were victims of the Spaniards. Then we were victims of the French. Then we were victims of Don Porfirio. Then we were victims of the PRI. Even of Salinas. And of El Peje. And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ... Hold on  Wait a minute  What if none of these things is the problem  The problem is not the things we feel victims of. The problem is that we play the role of victims. We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims. If only we stopped feeling like victims  if we stopped acting as victims  our country would change so much  I'm going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible  involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands. I'm going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence  from weakest to strongest. The first level  the weakest level of civil response against violence  is denial and apathy. Today  much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we're going through. We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances. Daily life in our country is  to say the least  under extraordinary  exceptional circumstances. It's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it's the flu and it will just go away. We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu. But it doesn't. Mexico has cancer. And if we don't do something about it  the cancer will end up killing it. We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response  which is  effectively  recognition. And that recognition will sow fear    recognizing the seriousness of the situation. But  fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something. Many people in Mexico are afraid today. We're very afraid. And we're acting out of that fear. And let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear    and this is the second level of civil response  fear. Let's think about Mexican streets  they're unsafe because of violence  so people stay at home. Does that make streets more or less safe  Less safe  So streets become more desolate and unsafe  so we stay home more    which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe  and we stay home even more. This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses  scared to death    even more afraid than when we were out on the streets. We need to confront this fear. We need to move Mexican society  the members of society who are at this level  to the next level  which is action. We need to face our fears and take back our streets  our cities  our neighborhoods. For many people  acting involves courage. We go from fear to courage. They say   I can't take it anymore. Let's do something about it.  Recently    this is a sensitive figure       public lynchings have been recorded so far in      in Mexico. Usually it's one or two a year. Now we're experiencing one every week. This shows that society is desperate and it's taking the law into its own hands. Unfortunately  violent action    though action is better than no action    but taking part in it only disguises violence. If I'm violent with you and you respond with violence  you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence. So civil action is vital  but it's also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level  which is non violent action. It's pacific  coordinated civil action  which doesn't mean passive action. It means it's determined and effective  but not violent. There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico. Two years ago  in Galena City  Chihuahua  a member of the community was kidnapped  Eric Le Bar n. His brothers  Benjam n and Juli n  got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action  to pay the ransom  to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help. In the end  Benjam n and Juli n decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together. So what did they do  They mobilized the whole community of Le Bar n to go to Chihuahua  where they organized a sit in in the central park of the city. They sent a message to the kidnappers   If you want your ransom come and get it. We'll be waiting for you right here.  They stayed there. Seven days later  Eric was set free and was able to return home. This is an example of what an organized society can do  a society that acts. Of course  criminals can respond. And in this case  they did. On July  th        Benjam n Le Bar n was murdered. But Juli n Le Bar n keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year. And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head. But he keeps fighting. He keeps organizing. He keeps mobilizing. These heroic acts are present all over the country. With a thousand Juli ns working together  Mexico would be a very different country. And they're out there  They just have to raise their hands. I was born in Mexico  I grew up in Mexico and along the way  I learned to love Mexico. I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land    not to mention all Mexican people    will agree that it's not difficult to love Mexico. I've traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have. That devotion we feel for the national football team. That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters  such as the earthquake in      or this year's floods. The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem since we were kids. When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy  and we sang  with a childlike heart   a soldier in each son.  I think the biggest insult  the worst way you can offend a Mexican is to insult their mother. A mother is the most sacred thing in life. Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children. We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history. Our mother  Mexico  is being violated before our very eyes. What are we going to do  Masiosare  the strange enemy  is here. Where is the soldier in each son  Mahatma Gandhi  one of the greatest civil fighters of all time  said   Be the change you wish to see in the world.  Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis. We need Gandhis. We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action. This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative. This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico    the festivals  the markets  the restaurants  the cantinas  the tequila  the mariachis  the serenades  the posadas  El Grito  the Day of the Dead  San Miguel  the joy  the passion for life  the fight and everything it means to be Mexican    doesn't disappear from this world. We're facing a very powerful opponent. But we are many more. They can take a man's life. Anyone can kill me  or you  or you. But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans. The battle is won  but we still have to fight it.      years ago  the Roman poet Juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true Mexican. He said   Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor  and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living.  Thank you. I'd like to begin with a thought experiment. Imagine that it's       years into the future. Civilization as we know it has ceased to exist    no books  no electronic devices  no Facebook or Twitter. All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet has been lost. Now imagine archeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities. What might they find  Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them. Perhaps some circular pieces of metal. Maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them. And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers    buried in the hills somewhere in North America    massive versions of these same symbols. Now let's ask ourselves  what could such artifacts say about us to people       years into the future  This is no hypothetical question. In fact  this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization  which existed       years ago. The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations  but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations. It occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers  covering what is now Pakistan  Northwestern India and parts of Afghanistan and Iran. Given that it was such a vast civilization  you might expect to find really powerful rulers  kings  and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings. In fact  what archeologists have found is none of that. They've found small objects such as these. Here's an example of one of these objects. Well obviously this is a replica. But who is this person  A king  A god  A priest  Or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me  We don't know. But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them. Well no  not pieces of plastic  but stone seals  copper tablets  pottery and  surprisingly  one large sign board  which was found buried near the gate of a city. Now we don't know if it says Hollywood  or even Bollywood for that matter. In fact  we don't even know what any of these objects say  and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered. We don't know what any of these symbols mean. The symbols are most commonly found on seals. So you see up there one such object. It's the square object with the unicorn like animal on it. Now that's a magnificent piece of art. So how big do you think that is  Perhaps that big  Or maybe that big  Well let me show you. Here's a replica of one such seal. It's only about one inch by one inch in size    pretty tiny. So what were these used for  We know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other. So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes  These were used to make those kinds of packing slips. You might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text. Perhaps they're the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other    we don't know. We need to decipher the script to answer that question. Deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle  it's actually become a question that's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia. In fact  the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people. First  there's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the Indus script does not represent a language at all. These people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on shields. There's a second group of people who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo European language. If you look at a map of India today  you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo European language family. So some people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient Indo European language such as Sanskrit. There's a last group of people who believe that the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today. These people believe that the Indus script represents an ancient form of the Dravidian language family  which is the language family spoken in much of South India today. And the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of Dravidian speaking people in the North  actually near Afghanistan  and they say that perhaps  sometime in the past  Dravidian languages were spoken all over India and that this suggests that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian. Which of these hypotheses can be true  We don't know  but perhaps if you deciphered the script  you would be able to answer this question. But deciphering the script is a very challenging task. First  there's no Rosetta Stone. I don't mean the software  I mean an ancient artifact that contains in the same text both a known text and an unknown text. We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script. And furthermore  we don't even know what language they spoke. And to make matters even worse  most of the text that we have are extremely short. So as I showed you  they're usually found on these seals that are very  very tiny. And so given these formidable obstacles  one might wonder and worry whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script. In the rest of my talk  I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the Indus script. I've always been fascinated by the Indus script ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook. And why was I fascinated  Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world. My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist  so in my day job  I create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions  how the brain makes decisions  how the brain learns and so on. But in       my path crossed again with the Indus script. That's when I was in India  and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some Indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script. And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists  and so I jumped at that opportunity. And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found. Or better yet  let's all collectively decipher. Are you ready  The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing. Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them. Can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right  I'll give you a couple of seconds. Okay. Right to left  how many  Okay. Okay. Left to right  Oh  it's almost      . Okay. The answer is  if you look at the left hand side of the two texts  you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs  and it seems like       years ago  when the scribe was writing from right to left  they ran out of space. And so they had to cram the sign. One of the signs is also below the text on the top. This suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left  and so that's one of the first things we know  that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts. And the Indus script now has this particular property. What other properties of language does the script show  Languages contain patterns. If I give you the letter Q and ask you to predict the next letter  what do you think that would be  Most of you said U  which is right. Now if I asked you to predict one more letter  what do you think that would be  Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A  but certainly not B  C or D  right  The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns. There's a lot of text that start with this diamond shaped symbol. And this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks like symbol. And this is very similar to a Q and U example. This symbol can in turn be followed by these fish like symbols and some other signs  but never by these other signs at the bottom. And furthermore  there's some signs that really prefer the end of texts  such as this jar shaped sign  and this sign  in fact  happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script. Given such patterns  here was our idea. The idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns  and so we gave the computer the existing texts. And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other. Given the computer model  we can test the model by essentially quizzing it. So we could deliberately erase some symbols  and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols. Here are some examples. You may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of Wheel of Fortune. What we found was that the computer was successful in    percent of the cases in predicting the correct symbol. In the rest of the cases  typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer. There's also practical use for this particular procedure. There's a lot of these texts that are damaged. Here's an example of one such text. And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction. Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted. And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze. Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model. So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard. I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this. Such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy. This is a physics and information theory term. But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters. How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard  You might have encountered the stuck key problem    so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again. This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all. Language  on the other hand  has an intermediate level of entropy  it's neither too rigid  nor is it too random. What about the Indus script  Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences. At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence  which is a random jumble of letters    and interestingly  we also find the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music. And both of these are very  very flexible  which is why you find them in the very high range. At the lower end of the scale  you find a rigid sequence  a sequence of all A's  and you also find a computer program  in this case in the language Fortran  which obeys really strict rules. Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range. Now what about the Indus script  We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts. When this result was first published  it was highly controversial. There were people who raised a hue and cry  and these people were the ones who believed that the Indus script does not represent language. I even started to get some hate mail. My students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection. Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession  What does this result really show  It shows that the Indus script shares an important property of language. So  as the old saying goes  if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script  then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands. What other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language  Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages. So for example  here's the same sentence written in English and the same sentence written in Dutch using the same letters of the alphabet. If you don't know Dutch and you only know English and I give you some words in Dutch  you'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns. Some things are not right  and you'll say these words are probably not English words. The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script. The computer found several texts    two of them are shown here    that have very unusual patterns. So for example the first text  there's a doubling of this jar shaped sign. This sign is the most frequently occurring sign in the Indus script  and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair. Why is that the case  We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found  and it turns out that they were found very  very far away from the Indus Valley. They were found in present day Iraq and Iran. And why were they found there  What I haven't told you is that the Indus people were very  very enterprising. They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived  and so in this case  they were traveling by sea all the way to Mesopotamia  present day Iraq. And what seems to have happened here is that the Indus traders  the merchants  were using this script to write a foreign language. It's just like our English and Dutch example. And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley. This suggests that the same script  the Indus script  could be used to write different languages. The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language. If it does represent language  then how do we read the symbols  That's our next big challenge. So you'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans  of insects  of fishes  of birds. Most ancient scripts use the rebus principle  which is  using pictures to represent words. So as an example  here's a word. Can you write it using pictures  I'll give you a couple seconds. Got it  Okay. Great. Here's my solution. You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf    and that's  belief   right. There could be other solutions. In the case of the Indus script  the problem is the reverse. You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense. So this is just like a crossword puzzle  except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it. My colleagues  Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola  have been making some headway on this particular problem. And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work. Here's a really short text. It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish like sign. And I want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods  so it's quite likely that these tags  at least some of them  contain names of merchants. And it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth. In Dravidian languages  the word for fish is  meen  which happens to sound just like the word for star. And so seven stars would stand for  elu meen   which is the Dravidian word for the Big Dipper star constellation. Similarly  there's another sequence of six stars  and that translates to  aru meen   which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades. And finally  there's other combinations  such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it. And that could be translated into  mey meen   which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn. So that was pretty exciting. It looks like we're getting somewhere. But does this prove that these seals contain Dravidian names based on planets and star constellations  Well not yet. So we have no way of validating these particular readings  but if more and more of these readings start making sense  and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct  then we know that we are on the right track. Today  we can write a word such as TED in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script  because both of these were deciphered in the   th century. The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly. The Mayans started speaking to us in the   th century  but the Indus civilization remains silent. Why should we care  The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis  it belongs to all of us. These are our ancestors    yours and mine. They were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history. If we decipher the script  we would enable them to speak to us again. What would they tell us  What would we find out about them  About us  I can't wait to find out. Thank you. It's an amazing thing that we're here to talk about the year of patients rising. You heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases  patients who are saying   You know what  I know what the odds are  but I'm going to go look for more information. I'm going to define what the terms of my success are.  I'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago I almost died    found out I was  in fact  already almost dead. And what I then found out about what's called the e Patient movement    I'll explain what that term means. I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave  and when I discovered this  I just renamed myself e Patient Dave. Regarding the word  patient   when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer  I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who's not in the room here  somebody out there. Some of our talks today  we still act like that. But I'm here to tell you   patient  is not a third person word. You  yourself  will find yourself in a hospital bed    or your mother  your child    there are heads nodding  people who say   Yes  I know exactly what you mean.  So when you hear what I'm going to talk about here today  first of all  I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met  all the ones I haven't met. This is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care  in fixing health care. One of the senior doctors at my hospital  Charlie Safran  and his colleague  Warner Slack  have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient. They have been saying that since the     s. Now I'm going to step back in history. This is from July      . I was a freshman in college  and this was when we first landed on the Moon. And it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface    that's the place where you and I are right now  where we live. The world was changing. It was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee. A few weeks later  Woodstock happened. Three days of fun and music. Here  just for historical authenticity  is a picture of me in that year. Yeah  the wavy hair  the blue eyes    it was really something. That Fall of       the Whole Earth Catalog came out. It was a hippie journal of self sufficiency. We think of hippies of being just hedonists  but there's a very strong component    I was in that movement    a very strong component of being responsible for yourself. This book's title's subtitle is   Access to Tools.  And it talked about how to build your own house  how to grow your own food  all kinds of things. In the     s  this young doctor  Tom Ferguson  was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog. And he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves. In fact  he said it was    to    percent of how we actually take care of our bodies. Well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease  the key thing that holds us back is access to information. And when the Web came along  that changed everything  because not only could we find information  we could find other people like ourselves who could gather  who could bring us information. And he coined this term e Patients    equipped  engaged  empowered  enabled. Obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then. Now I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term. In       I went to my doctor for a regular physical  and I had said   I have a sore shoulder.  Well  I got an X ray  and the next morning    you may have noticed  those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this. This morning  some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition. For me  it was      AM on January        . I was at the office  my desk was clean  I had the blue partition carpet on the walls. The phone rang and it was my doctor. He said   Dave  I pulled up the X ray image on the screen on the computer at home.  He said   Your shoulder's going to be fine  but Dave  there's something in your lung.  And if you look in that red oval  that shadow was not supposed to be there. To make a long story short  I said   So you need me to get back in there   He said   Yeah  we're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest.  And in parting I said   Is there anything I should do   He said    think about this one. This is the advice your doctor gives you   just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife.  I went in for the CAT scan  and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs. So at that point we knew that it was cancer. We knew it wasn't lung cancer. That meant it was metastasized from somewhere. The question was  where from  So I went in for an ultrasound. I got to do what many women have    the jelly on the belly and bzzzz. My wife came with me. She's a veterinarian  so she's seen lots of ultrasounds. I mean  she knows I'm not a dog. But what we saw    this is an MRI image. This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be. What we saw in that kidney was that big blob there. And there were actually two of these. One was growing out the front and it had already erupted  and it latched onto the bowel. One was growing out the back  and it attached to the soleus muscle  which is a big muscle in the back that I'd never heard of  but all of a sudden I cared about it. I went home. Now I've been Googling    I've been online since      on CompuServe. I went home  and I know you can't read the details here  that's not important. My point is I went to a respected medical website  WebMD  because I know how to filter out junk. I also found my wife online. Before I met her  I went through some suboptimal search results. So I looked for quality information. There's so much about trust    what sources of information can we trust  Where does my body end and an invader start  And cancer  a tumor  is something you grow out of your own tissue. How does that happen  Where does medical ability end and start  Well  so what I read on WebMD   The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer. Almost all patients are incurable.  I've been online long enough to know if I don't like the first results I get  I go look for more. And what I found was on other websites  even by the third page of Google results   Outlook is bleak    Prognosis is grim.  And I'm thinking   What the heck   I didn't feel sick at all. I mean  I'd been getting tired in the evening  but I was    years old. I was slowly losing weight  but for me  that was what the doctor told me to do. It was really something. And this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug I eventually got. Totally by coincidence  there's that thing in my lung. In the left femur  the left thigh bone  there's another one. I had one. My leg eventually snapped. I fainted and landed on it  and it broke. There's one in the skull  and then just for good measure  I had these other tumors    including  by the time my treatment started  one was growing out of my tongue. I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue. And what I read was that my median survival was    weeks. This was bad. I was facing the grave. I thought   What's my mother's face going to look like on the day of my funeral   I had to sit down with my daughter and say   Here's the situation.  Her boyfriend was with her. I said   I don't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while Dad's still alive.  It's really serious. Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help  think about this. Well  my doctor prescribed a patient community  Acor.org  a network of cancer patients  of all amazing things. Very quickly they told me   Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease. Get yourself to a specialist center. There is no cure  but there's something that sometimes works    it usually doesn't    called high dosage interleukin. Most hospitals don't offer it  so they won't even tell you it exists. And don't let them give you anything else first. And by the way  here are four doctors in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers.  How amazing is that  Here's the thing. Here we are  four years later  you can't find a website that gives patients that information. Government approved  American Cancer Society  but patients know what patients want to know. It's the power of patient networks. This amazing substance    again I mentioned  where does my body end  My oncologist and I talk a lot these days because I try to keep my talks technically accurate. And he said   You know  the immune system is good at detecting invaders    bacteria coming from outside    but when it's your own tissue that you've grown  it's a whole different thing.  And I went through a mental exercise actually  because I started a patient support community of my own on a website  and one of my friends  one of my relatives actually  said   Look  Dave  who grew this thing  Are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself   So we went into it. And the story of how all that happens is in this book. Anyway  this is the way the numbers unfolded. Me being me  I put the numbers from my hospital's website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet. Don't worry about the numbers. You see  that's the immune system. Amazing thing  those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart. And look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between. Just incredible. Who knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it. The punch line is that a year and a half later  I was there when this magnificent young woman  my daughter  got married. And when she came down those steps  and it was just her and me for that moment  I was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother   I wish Dad could have been here.  And this is what we're doing when we make health care better. Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care. This is Regina Holliday  a painter in Washington D.C.  whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease. She's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital. One of the things that she discovered was that her husband's medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized. And she thought   You know  if I have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box  why can't there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty  every new doctor  the basics about my husband's condition   So she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label  something like that  in a diagram of him. She then  last year  painted this diagram. She studied health care like me. She came to realize that there were a lot of people who'd written patient advocate books that you just don't hear about at medical conferences. Patients are such an underutilized resource. Well as it says in my introduction  I've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data. And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago   Give me my damn data  because you people can't be trusted to keep it clean.  And here she has our damned data    it's a pun    which is starting to break out  starting to break through    the water symbolizes our data. And in fact  I want to do a little something improvisational for you here. There's a guy on Twitter that I know  a health IT guy outside Boston  and he wrote the e Patient rap. And it goes like this.   Gimme my damn data     I want to be an e Patient just like Dave     Gimme my damn data  cuz it's my life to save   Now I'm not going to go any further. Well thank you. That shot the timing. Think about the possibility  why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family  Here's a website  VisibleBody.com  that I stumbled across. And I thought   You know  I wonder what my soleus muscle is   So you can click on things and remove it. And I saw   Aha  that's the kidney and the soleus muscle.  And I was rotating it in  D and saying   I understand now.  And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth  where you can fly to any address. And I thought   Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body   What did Google come out with this year  Now there's Google Body browser. But you see  it's still generic. It's not my data. But if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it  the way software innovators like to do  who knows what we'll be able to come up with. One final story  this is Kelly Young  a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida. This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks. RA patients  as they call themselves    her blog is RA Warrior    have a big problem because    percent of them have no visible symptoms. And that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going. And some doctors think   Yeah right  you're really in pain.  Well she found  through her online research  a nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer  but it can also reveal inflammation. And she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray. So she took it. And the radiologist report said   No cancer found.  Well that's not what he was supposed to do with it. So she had it read again  she wanted to have it read again  and her doctor fired her. She pulled up the CD. He said   If you don't want to follow my instructions  go away.  So she pulled up the CD of the scan images  and look at all those hot spots. And she's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care. See  that is an empowered patient    no medical training. We are  you are  the most underused resource in health care. What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data. How big a deal was this  Well at TED      Tim Berners Lee himself  inventor of the Web  gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser go out and find other people's articles about the data  but the raw data. And he got them chanting by the end of the talk   Raw data now. Raw data now.  And I ask you  three words  please  to improve health care  let patients help. Let patients help. Let patients help. Let patients help. Thank you. For all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast  God bless you  everyone    let patients help. Host  And bless yourself. Thank you very much. The Highline is an old  elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan. And it was originally a freight line that ran down   th Ave. And it became known as  Death Avenue  because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front  and he became known as the  West Side Cowboy.  But even with a cowboy  about one person a month was killed and run over. So they elevated it. They built it    ft. in the air  right through the middle of the city. But with the rise of interstate trucking  it was used less and less. And by       the last train rode. It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys    they say  at Thanksgiving    from the meatpacking district. And then it was abandoned. And I live in the neighborhood  and I first read about it in the New York Times  in an article that said it was going to be demolished. And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer  but I realized no one was doing anything. I went to my first community board meeting    which I'd never been to one before    and sat next to another guy named Joshua David  who's a travel writer. And at the end of the meeting  we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project  most people wanted to tear it down. So we exchanged business cards  and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization  Friends of the High Line. And the goal at first was just saving it from demolition  but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it. And what first attracted me  or interested me  was this view from the street    which is this steel structure  sort of rusty  this industrial relic. But when I went up on top  it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River. And that's really where we started  the idea coalesced around  let's make this a park  and let's have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape. At the time  there was a lot of opposition. Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down. I'm going to fast forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement. Mayor Bloomberg came in office  he was very supportive  but we still had to make the economic case. This was after       the city was in tough times. So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case. And it turns out  we got those numbers wrong. We thought it would cost     million dollars to build. So far it's cost about     million. And the main case was  this is going to make good economic sense for the city. So we said over a    year time period  the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about     million. That was enough. It really got the city behind it. It turns out we were wrong on that. Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars  or will create about a half a billion dollars  in tax revenues for the city. We did a design competition  selected a design team. We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape. There's three sections. We opened the fist section in     . It's been successful beyond our dreams. Last year we had about two million people  which is about    times what we ever estimated. This is one of my favorite features in section one. It's this amphitheater right over   th Ave. And the first section ends at   th St. right now. The other thing  it's generated  obviously  a lot of economic value  it's also inspired  I think  a lot of great architecture. There's a point  you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry  Jean Nouvel  Shigeru Ban  Neil Denari. And the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line. And this has been designed by Renzo Piano. And they're going to break ground in May. And we've already started construction on section two. This is one of my favorite features  this flyover where you're eight feet off the surface of the High Line  running through a canopy of trees. The High Line used to be covered in billboards  and so we've taken a playful take where  instead of framing advertisements  it's going to frame people in views of the city. This was just installed last month. And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards  which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan. And the city has planned    for better or for worse       million square feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around. But what really  I think  makes the High Line special is the people. And honestly  even though I love the designs that we were building  I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it  because I fell in love with that wildscape    and how could you recreate that magic  But what I found is it's in the people and how they use it that  to me  makes it so special. Just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line. And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands  we just don't do that outside. But you see that happening on the High Line  and I think that's the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other. Thanks. A few years ago  I felt like I was stuck in a rut  so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher  Morgan Spurlock  and try something new for    days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next    days. It turns out    days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit    like watching the news    from your life. There's a few things I learned while doing these    day challenges. The first was  instead of the months flying by  forgotten  the time was much more memorable. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder    day challenges  my self confidence grew. I went from desk dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun  Even last year  I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro  the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my    day challenges. I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough  you can do anything for    days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel  Every November  tens of thousands of people try to write their own        word novel  from scratch  in    days. It turns out  all you have to do is write       words a day for a month. So I did. By the way  the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. You might be sleep deprived  but you'll finish your novel. Now is my book the next great American novel  No. I wrote it in a month. It's awful. But for the rest of my life  if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party  I don't have to say   I'm a computer scientist.  No  no  if I want to  I can say   I'm a novelist.  So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. I learned that when I made small  sustainable changes  things I could keep doing  they were more likely to stick. There's nothing wrong with big  crazy challenges. In fact  they're a ton of fun. But they're less likely to stick. When I gave up sugar for    days  day    looked like this. So here's my question to you  What are you waiting for  I guarantee you the next    days are going to pass whether you like it or not  so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot  For the next    days. Thanks. So I'm going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food. I've been interested in food for a long time. I taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this. I went to chef school in France. And there is a way the world both envisions food  the way the world writes about food and learns about food. And it's largely what you would find in these books. And it's a wonderful thing. But there's some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established. In the last    years  people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food. In fact  understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking    some of the chemistry  some of the physics and so forth. But that's not in any of those books. There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed  some about new aesthetics  new approaches to food. There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria. He's developed a very avant garde cuisine. A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal  he's developed his avant garde cuisine. None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last    years is in any of those books. None of them are taught in cooking schools. In order to learn them  you have to go work in those restaurants. And finally  there's the old way of viewing food is the old way. And so a few years ago    fours years ago  actually    I set out to say  is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder  Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before  So we tried  and I'll show you what we came up with. This is a picture called a cutaway. This is actually the first picture I took in the book. The idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli. And this magic view allows you to see all of what's happening while the broccoli steams. Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact. And the hope was two fold. One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli. But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical  maybe a little bit more scientific  maybe a little bit more chef y than they otherwise would have. Because with that beautiful photo  maybe I can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time. Steaming ought to be faster. It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation  and this explains that. Well  that first cutaway picture worked  so we said   Okay  let's do some more.  So here's another one. We discovered why woks are the shape they are. This shaped wok doesn't work very well  this caught fire three times. But we had a philosophy  which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second. And one of our canning cutaways. Once you start cutting things in half  you kind of get carried away  so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan. And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on. In this case  boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic. You don't have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid. So this is great for pickled vegetables  which is what we're canning here. Here's our hamburger cutaway. One of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish. So you can lavish all the same care  all the same technique  on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish. And if you do lavish as much technique as possible  and you try to make the highest quality hamburger  it gets to be a little bit involved. The New York Times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called  The Wait for the    Hour Hamburger Just Got Longer.  Because our hamburger recipe  our ultimate hamburger recipe  if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff  it does take about    hours. Of course  you're not actually working the whole time. Most of the time is kind of sitting there. The point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers  because  believe it or not  there is something to the physics and chemistry    in particular  those flames underneath the burger. Most of the characteristic char grilled taste doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal. Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference. Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing  or burning. So it's the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste. Now you might wonder  how do we make these cutaways  Most people assume we use Photoshop. And the answer is  no  not really  we use a machine shop. And it turns out  the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half. So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world. We cut a        restaurant oven in half. The manufacturer said   What would it take for you to cut one in half   I said   It would have to show up free.  And so it showed up  we used it a little while  we cut it in half. Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots. We would glue a piece of Pyrex or heat resistant glass in front. We used a red  very high temperature silicon to do that. The great thing is  when you cut something in half  you have another half. So you photograph that in exactly the same position  and then you can substitute in    and that part does use Photoshop    just the edges. So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air  supported by wires  and then they take the wires away digitally so you're flying through the air. In most cases  though  there was no glass. Like for the hamburger  we just cut the damn barbecue. And so those coals that kept falling off the edge  we kept having to put them back up. But again  it only has to work for a thousandth of a second. The wok shot caught fire three times. What happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh  One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way. But hey  they grow back. In addition to cutaways  we also explain physics. This is Fourier's law of heat conduction. It's a partial differential equation. We have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it. But to make them palatable  we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this. We've got lots of little tidbits in the book. Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage  right  But you probably don't know that much about James Watt. But now you will  we put a biography of James Watt in. It's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt  and where he got his inspiration. It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey. We also did a lot of calculation. I personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook. Here's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue  or other radiant heat source  goes as you move away from it. So as you move vertically away from this surface  the heat falls off. As you move side to side  it moves off. That horn shaped region is what we call the sweet spot. That's the place where the heat is even to within    percent. So that's the place where you really want to cook. And it's got this funny horn shaped thing  which as far as I know  again  the first cookbook to ever do this. Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it. You know  there's two ways you can make a product. You can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want  or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it. Here's a step by step that shows grinding hamburger. If you really want great hamburger  it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain. And it's really simple  as you can see here. As it comes out of the grinder  you just have a little tray  and you just take it off in little passes  build it up  slice it vertically. Here's the final hamburger. This is the    hour hamburger. We make every aspect of this burger. The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it. We also have things about how to make the bun. There's a mushroom  ketchup    it goes on and on. Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here. The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics. Isn't that beautiful  We have a very high speed camera  which we had lots of fun with on the book. The key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of      . That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn. So it's a great illustration of that. Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual. We have a chapter on gels. And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI  I thought  well  let's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin. Well  if you have a high speed camera  and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around  pretty soon somebody does this. Now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot    that's why you shouldn't get shot. The other amazing thing is  when this ballistics gelatin comes down  it falls back down as a nice block. Anyway  here's the book. Here it is.       pages. And they're nice big pages too. A friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen  so there's a sixth volume that has washable  waterproof paper. Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are  There are a quarter of a million    at least those are the ones we know about    a quarter of a million species of flowering plants. And flowers are a real bugger. They're really difficult for plants to produce. They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources. Why would they go to that bother  And the answer of course  like so many things in the world  is sex. I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures. And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important    there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce. You can take cuttings  they can sort of have sex with themselves  they can pollinate themselves. But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches. Evolution works that way. Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen. Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before. As I say  every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these. And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants. And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on. Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen  and that's a very inefficient process  which is why it gets up our noses so much. Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it  hoping that your sex cells  your male sex cells  which are held within the pollen  will somehow reach another flower just by chance. So all the grasses  which means all of the cereal crops  and most of the trees have wind borne pollen. But most species actually use insects to do their bidding  and that's more intelligent in a way  because the pollen  they don't need so much of it. The insects and other species can take the pollen  transfer it directly to where it's required. So we're aware  obviously  of the relationship between insects and plants. There's a symbiotic relationship there  whether it's flies or birds or bees  they're getting something in return  and that something in return is generally nectar. Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations    the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation. The plant gets something  and the hawk moth spreads the pollen somewhere else. Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way. There are markings on many plants that look like other insects. These are the anthers of a lily  cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it  the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with. And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws  and in a way  it has  it forces the insect to crawl out  getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else. Orchids  there are         at least  species of orchids    amazingly  amazingly diverse. And they get up to all sorts of tricks. They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding. This orchid  known as Darwin's orchid  because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it    you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid. And basically what the insect has to do    we're in the middle of the flower    it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar. And Darwin said  looking at this flower   I guess something has coevolved with this.  And sure enough  there's the insect. And I mean  normally it kind of rolls it away  but in its erect form  that's what it looks like. Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators  then  just as in human sex  people might start to deceive. They might say   I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it   Now this is a plant. This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love  and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom. And this is the mimic. So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant. And here is the long probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic  because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some. So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant  it's also    if you look very closely just at the head end  you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant  if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card. Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom. This flower with its black dots  they might look like black dots to us  but if I tell you  to a male insect of the right species  that looks like two females who are really  really hot to trot. And when the insect gets there and lands on it  dousing itself in pollen  of course  that it's going to take to another plant  if you look at the every home should have one scanning electron microscope picture  you can see that there are actually some patterning there  which is three dimensional. So it probably even feels good for the insect  as well as looking good. And these electron microscope pictures    here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect    you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye  have very  very different textures to what an insect might perceive. And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles. And under the scanning electron microscope  you can see the surface there    really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at. Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect  even to us. I mean  I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast. It's a wonderful  amazing thing. This one's clever. It's called obsidian. I think of it as insidium sometimes. To the right species of bee  this looks like another very aggressive bee  and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away  and  of course  covers itself with pollen. The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects. And this one doesn't have anything for them. So it's deceiving on two levels    fabulous. Here we see ylang ylang  the component of many perfumes. I actually smelt someone with some on earlier. And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy. They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it. This one doesn't smell so good. This is a flower that really  really smells pretty nasty and is designed  again  evolved  to look like carrion. So flies love this. They fly in and they pollinate. This  which is helicodiceros  is also known as dead horse arum. I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like  but this one probably smells pretty much like it. It's really horrible. And blowflies just can't help themselves. They fly into this thing  and they fly all the way down it. They lay their eggs in it  thinking it's a nice bit of carrion  and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs  that the eggs are going to die  but the plant  meanwhile  has benefited  because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower    fantastic. Here's arum  arum maculatum   lords and ladies   or  cuckoo pint  in this country. I photographed this thing last week in Dorset. This thing heats up by about    degrees above ambient temperature    amazing. And if you look down into it  there's this sort of dam past the spadix  flies get attracted by the heat    which is boiling off volatile chemicals  little midges    and they get trapped underneath in this container. They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky. At night they get covered in pollen  which showers down over them  and then the bristles that we saw above  they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out  covered in pollen    fabulous thing. Now if you think that's fabulous  this is one of my great favorites. This is the philodendron selloum. For anyone here from Brazil  you'll know about this plant. This is the most amazing thing. That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long. And it does something that no other plant that I know of does  and that is that when it flowers    that's the spadix in the middle there    for a period of about two days  it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals. So instead of having starch  which is the food of plants  it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat  metabolizing  about the rate of a small cat. And that's twice the energy output  weight for weight  than a hummingbird    absolutely astonishing. This thing does something else which is unusual. Not only will it raise itself to     Fahrenheit     or    degrees Centigrade  for two days  but it keeps constant temperature. There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.  Now why does it do this   I hear you ask. Now wouldn't you know it  there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature. And they get inside  and they get it all on. And the plant showers them with pollen  and off they go and pollinate. And what a wonderful thing it is. Now most pollinators that we think about are insects  but actually in the tropics  many birds and butterflies pollinate. And many of the tropical flowers are red  and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us  we think  and can see the color red very well. But if you look at the spectrum  birds and us  we see red  green and blue and see that spectrum. Insects see green  blue and ultraviolet  and they see various shades of ultraviolet. So there's something that goes on off the end there.  And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is   I hear you ask. Well yes we can. So what is an insect seeing  Last week I took these pictures of rock rose  helianthemum  in Dorset. These are little yellow flowers like we all see  little yellow flowers all over the place. And this is what it looks like with visible light. This is what it looks like if you take out the red. Most bees don't perceive red. And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very  very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got. And that's a real fantastic bull's eye. Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees  any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red. We can't know what's going on in    let alone an insect's    another human being's mind. But the contrast will look something like that  so standing out a lot from the background. Here's another little flower    different range of ultraviolet frequencies  different filters to match the pollinators. And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing. Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property    no flower was damaged in the process of this shot  it was just attached to the tripod  not killed    then under ultraviolet light  look at that. And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light. So maybe the chemical in that would be useful. Finally  there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me    fantastic hidden pattern. And I love the idea of something hidden. I think there's something poetic here  that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter  the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus    actually the clouds of Venus. That's the main use of that filter. Venus  of course  is the god of love and fertility  which is the flower story. And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding  they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death  and particularly at marriage  which  when you think of it  is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another. Thank you very much. There was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect. Everywhere I went  I felt at home. Everyone I met  I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember. And I want to share with you how I came to that place and what I've learned since I left it. This is where it began. And it raises an existential question  which is  if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness  why am I not visible in the photograph  and where is this time and place  This is Los Angeles  California  where I live. This is a police photo. That's actually my car. We're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles  called Cedars Sinai. And the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work have run across the wreckage  and they've advised the police that there were no survivors inside the car  that the driver's dead  that I'm dead. And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver. And when they do  they find that behind the glass  they find me. And my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed  all but two of my ribs  my pelvis and both arms    they're all crushed  but there is still a pulse. And they get me to that nearby hospital  Cedars Sinai  where that night I receive  because of my internal bleeding     units of blood    which means full replacements of all the blood in me    before they're able to staunch the flow. I'm put on full life support  and I have a massive stroke  and my brain drops into a coma. Now comas are measured on a scale from    down to three. Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest. And if you look  you'll see that there's only one way you can score three. It's essentially there's no sign of life from outside at all. I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three  and it is inside that deepest level of coma  on the rim between my life and my death  that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness of inner space. From my family looking in from outside  what they're trying to figure out is a different kind of existential question  which is  how far is it going to be possible to bridge from the comatose potential mind that they're looking at to an actual mind  which I define simply as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head. Now to put this into a broader context  I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien watching the Earth from outer space  and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television is the Earth channel  and your favorite show is the Human Show. And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting. It's so unpredictable and so fragile. And this is how we began. We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia. The show began with tremendous special effects  because there were catastrophic climate shifts    which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today. Because of the Earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts  we had to figure out how to find better food  and we had to learn    there's Lucy  that's how we all began    we had to learn how to crack open animal bones  use tools to do that  to feed on the marrow  to grow our brains more. So we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat. Now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in India  in Madhya Pradesh  there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found. It's a cupule that took    to        blows with a stone tool to create  and it's the first known expression of art on the planet. And the reason it connects us with consciousness today is that all of us still today  the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle. And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle. We create an eye    and the eye that evolves through all of our history. There's the Egyptian god Horus  which symbolizes prosperity  wisdom and health. And that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the United States  which has on it an eye of providence. So watching all of this show from outer space  you think we get it  we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness. Because it's the first thing we draw  we surround ourselves with images of it  it's probably the most common image on the planet. But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted. While I was producing in Los Angeles  I never thought about it for a second. Until it was stripped from me  I never thought about it. And what I've learned since that event and during my recovery is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it's never been under threat before. These are just some examples. And the reason I'm so honored to be here to talk today in India is because India has the sad distinction of being the head injury capital of the world. That statistic is so sad. There is no more drastic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury. Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation  which means that India  unless something changes  is accumulating a need for millennia of rehabilitation. What you find in the United States is an injury every    seconds    that's one and a half million every year    stroke every    seconds  Alzheimer's disease  every    seconds somebody succumbs to that. All of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind. And here are some of the other categories  if you look at the whole planet. The World Health Organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on Earth in terms of years lived with disability. We find that the number two source of disability is depression in the age group of    to   . Our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate. I discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide. If you look at some of these other items    concussions. Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents are for concussions. If I talk about migraine     percent of the population suffer episodic headaches. Fifteen percent suffer migraines that wipe them out for days on end. All of this is leading    computer addiction  just to cover that  the most frequent thing we do is use digital devices. The average teenager sends       texts every  month . We're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift. So what you'd be wondering  watching the Human Show  is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness  or are we going to continue to retreat  And that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of Cedars Sinai medical center and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind. This is a dense array EEG MRI tracking     channels of information. It's not my EEG at Cedars  it's your EEG tonight and last night. It's the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning. This is how I was when I returned from the hospital after nearly four months. The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life. But if you look into the eye of consciousness  that single eye you can see  I'm looking down  but let me tell you how I felt at that point. I didn't feel empty  I felt everything simultaneously. I felt empty and full  hot and cold  euphoric and depressed because the brain is the world's first fully functional quantum computer  it can occupy multiple states at the same time. And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged  I felt everything simultaneously. But let's swivel around and look at me frontally. This is now flash forward to the point in time where I've been discharged by the health system. Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes. I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book. But the system has moved me on because  as my family started to discover  there is no long term concept in the health care system. Neurological damage     years of rehab  requires a long term perspective. But let's take a look behind my eyes. This is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three dimensional function within the brain. It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension  but in two dimensions I think you can see the beautiful symmetry and illumination of a normal mind at work. Here's my brain. That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke. So my family  as we moved forward and discovered that the health care system had moved us by  had to try to find solutions and answers. And during that process    it took many years    one of the doctors said that my recovery  my degree of advance  since the amount of head injury I'd suffered  was miraculous. And that was when I started to write a book  because I didn't think it was miraculous. I thought there were miraculous elements  but I also didn't think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society. So from this experience of my recovery  I want to share four particular aspects    I call them the four C's of consciousness    that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that I work with every day. The first C is cognitive training. Unlike the smashed glass of my car  plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility  with treatment  to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness. Plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason    hope for our ability to rebuild that function. Indeed  the mind can redefine itself  and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva back in the     's. The global perspective is that up to    percent of children in school have learning weaknesses that are not self correcting  but with appropriate treatment  they can be screened for and detected and corrected and avoid their academic failure. But what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone who provides that treatment or care. Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it. I'm not a doctor  so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests. Let's just talk about full scale I.Q. Full scale I.Q. is the mental processing    how fast you can acquire information  retain it and retrieve it    that is essential for success in life today. And you can see here there are three columns. Untestable    that's when I'm in my coma. And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of     which is just below average. In the health care system  if you touch average  you're done. That's when I was discharged from the system. What does average I.Q. really mean  It meant that when I was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in    minutes  I might score an F. This is a very  very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system. Then I underwent cognitive training. And let me show you what happened to the right hand column when I did my cognitive training over a period of time. This is not supposed to occur. I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify at the age of eight. Now the Journal of the National Medical Association gave my memoir a full clinical review  which is very unusual. I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever. But they felt the evidences that there was important  valuable information in the book  and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it. But they asked one question. They said   Is this repeatable   That was a fair question because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me. The answer is yes  and for the first time  it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples. Here's somebody  what they did as they went through cognitive training at ages seven and   . And here's another person in  call it  high school and college. And this person is particularly interesting. I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests  but they still had a neurologic issue. But that person could be identified as having a learning disability. And with accommodation  they went on to college and had a full life in terms of their opportunities. Second aspect  I still had crushing migraine headaches. Two elements that worked for me here are    the first is    percent  I learned  of head and neck pain is through muscular skeletal imbalance. The craniomandibular system is critical to that. And when I underwent it and found solutions  this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth. Up to    percent of the population have a disorder  disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body. I was fortunate to find a dentist who applied this entire universe of technology you're about to see to establish that if he repositioned my jaw  the headaches pretty much resolved  but that then my teeth weren't in the right place. He then held my jaw in the right position while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment. So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position. This affected my entire body. If that sounds like a very  very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement    How can the jaw affect the entire body     let me simply point out to you  if I ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk  how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand  That tiny misalignment. Bear in mind  there are no nerves in the teeth. That's why the same between the before and after that this shows  it's hard to see the difference. Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes. I still had migraine headaches. The next issue that resolved was that  if    percent of head and neck pain is caused by imbalance  the other    percent  largely    if you set aside aneurysms  brain cancer and hormonal issues    is the circulation. Imagine the blood flowing through your body    I was told at UCLA Medical Center    as one sealed system. There's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it  and around that pipe are the nerves drawing their nutrient supply from the blood. That's basically it. If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system  it bulges someplace else. If that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body  your brain  you get a vascular migraine. This is a level of pain that's only known to other people who suffer vascular migraines. Using this technology  this is mapping in three dimensions. This is an MRI MRA MRV  a volumetric MRI. Using this technology  the specialists at UCLA Medical Center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring. A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body. And in the following months and years  I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning. Communication  the next C. This is critical. All consciousness is about communication. And here  by great fortune  one of my father's clients had a husband who worked at the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research. Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness  whether to restore hearing to the deaf  vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed. And I'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed. I've brought with me  from Southern California  the FM device. This is it being held in the hand. It weighs less than a gram. So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime. Five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin. Where does it go inside the body  It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion free for over    years. So it goes in and it stays there. Here are the implantation sites. The concept that they're working towards    and they have working prototypes    is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they're needed. The main unit will then go inside the brain. An FM device in the cortex of the brain  the motor cortex  will send signals in real time to the motor points in the relevant muscles so that the person will be able to move their arm  let's say  in real time  if they've lost control of their arm. And other FM devices implanted in fingertips  on contacting a surface  will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain  so that the person feels a sense of touch. Is this science fiction  No  because I'm wearing the first application of this technology. I don't have the ability to control my left foot. A radio device is controlling every step I take  and a sensor picks up my foot for me every time I walk. And in closing  I want to share the personal reason why this meant so much to me and changed the direction of my life. In my coma  one of the presences I sensed was someone I felt was a protector. And when I came out of my coma  I recognized my family  but I didn't remember my own past. Gradually  I remembered the protector was my wife. And I whispered the good news through my broken jaw  which was wired shut  to my night nurse. And the following morning  my mother came to explain that I'd not always been in this bed  in this room  that I'd been working in film and television and that I had been in a crash and that  yes  I was married  but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash. And during my time in coma  she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix. Now in the dark years that followed  I had to work out what remained for me if everything that made today special was gone. And as I discovered these threats to consciousness and how they are surrounding the world and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day  I discovered what truly remained. I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness  that the Human Show can stay on the air for millennia to come. I believe that we can all rise and shine. Thank you very much. Lakshmi Pratury  Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second. You know  when I heard Simon's    please sit down  I just want to talk to him for a second    when I read his book  I went to LA to meet him. And so I was sitting in this restaurant  waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty ... I don't know what I had in my mind. And he was walking around. I didn't expect that person that I was going to meet to be him. And then we met and we talked  and I'm like  he doesn't look like somebody who was built out of nothing. And then I was amazed at what role technology played in your recovery. And we have his book outside in the bookshop. The thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to  every treatment he got  every near miss he had  and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations. So I think this one detail went past people really quick. Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg. Simon Lewis  I knew when I was timing this that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about    Well this is it. This is the control unit. And this records every single step I've taken for  ooh  five or six years now. And if I do this  probably the mic won't hear it. That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on. When I press it again  it'll chirp three times  and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go. And that's my friend. I mean  I charge it every night. And it works. It works. And what I would love to add because I didn't have time ... What does it do  Well actually  I'll show you down here. This down here  if the camera can see that  that is a small antenna. Underneath my heel  there is a sensor that detects when my foot leaves the ground    what's called the heel lift. This thing blinks all the time  I'll leave it out  so you might be able to see it. But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time. And if you walk faster  if I walk faster  it detects what's called the time interval  which is the interval between each heel lift. And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation. The other things they've worked on    I didn't have time to say this in my talk    is they've restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people. I could tell you the story  this was going to be an abandoned technology  but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire   Dr. Schindler.  And he was going to retire    all the technology was going to be lost  because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on because it was a small issue. But there's millions of deaf people in the world  and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now. It works. And the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind. And this  this is the implantable generation. Because what I didn't say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal. I should clarify that. Because the first generation is exoskeletal  it's wrapped around the leg  around the affected limb. I must tell you  they're an amazing    there's a hundred people who work in that building    engineers  scientists  and other team members    all the time. Alfred Mann has set up this foundation to advance this research because he saw there's no way venture capital would come in for something like this. The audience is too small. You'd think  there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world  but the audience is too small  and the amount of research  the time it takes  the FDA clearances  the payback time is too long for V.C. to be interested. So he saw a need and he stepped in. He's a very  very remarkable man. He's done a lot of very cutting edge science. LP  So when you get a chance  spend some time with Simon. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning everybody. I work with really amazing  little  itty bitty creatures called cells. And let me tell you what it's like to grow these cells in the lab. I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment. We plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes. And we feed them    sterilely of course    with what we call cell culture media    which is like their food    and we grow them in incubators. Why do I do this  We observe the cells in a plate  and they're just on the surface. But what we're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them. What does that even mean  Well it means growing an actual heart  let's say  or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body. Not only that  but they can also be used for disease models. And for this purpose  traditional cell culture techniques just really aren't enough. The cells are kind of homesick  the dish doesn't feel like their home. And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive. We call this the biomimetic paradigm    copying nature in the lab. Let's take the example of the heart  the topic of a lot of my research. What makes the heart unique  Well  the heart beats  rhythmically  tirelessly  faithfully. We copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes. These electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab. What else do we know about the heart  Well  heart cells are pretty greedy. Nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very  very dense blood supply. In the lab  we micro pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells  and this allows us to flow the cell culture media  the cells' food  through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells    a lot like what you might expect from a capillary bed in the heart. So this brings me to lesson number one  life can do a lot with very little. Let's take the example of electrical stimulation. Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be. On the left  we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that I engineered from rat cells in the lab. It's about the size of a mini marshmallow. And after one week  it's beating. You can see it in the upper left hand corner. But don't worry if you can't see it so well. It's amazing that these cells beat at all. But what's really amazing is that the cells  when we electrically stimulate them  like with a pacemaker  that they beat so much more. But that brings me to lesson number two  cells do all the work. In a sense  tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here  because structural engineers build bridges and big things  computer engineers  computers  but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves. What does this mean for us  Let's do something really simple. Let's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept. Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way.  We are what we eat   could easily be described as   We are what our cells eat.  And in the case of the flora in our gut  these cells may not even be human. But it's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life. Behind every sound  sight  touch  taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us. It begs the question  shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies  I invite you to talk about this with me further  and in the meantime  I wish you luck. May none of your non cancer cells become endangered species. Thank you. So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in     . with one will  one resolve  one cause. Our enemies shall talk themselves to death  and we will fight them with their own confusion. We shall prevail. Narrator  On January   th  Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why      won't be like      .  Rebecca MacKinnon  So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today. Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free. Fast forward more than two decades  Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store. The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups. His app wasn't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize. The German magazine Stern  a news magazine  had its app censored because the Apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users  and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout Germany. And more controversially  recently  Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks. So here's the thing. We have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies. Or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed. Or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many  or most  of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question. So here's the situation. In a pre Internet world  sovereignty over our physical freedoms  or lack thereof  was controlled almost entirely by nation states. But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace. And their decisions about software coding  engineering  design  terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives. And their sovereignties  cross cutting  globally interlinked  can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation states in very exciting ways  but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world. After all  even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year. And these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in Tunisia and Egypt this past spring and beyond. As Wael Ghonim  the Google Egyptian executive by day  secret Facebook activist by night  famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down   If you want to liberate a society  just give them the Internet.  But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated. On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the Egyptian state security offices in March. And many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles. But some of the files were left behind intact  and activists  some of them  found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges  their cellphone text message exchanges  even Skype conversations. And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces. And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there. And in Tunisia  censorship actually began to return in May    not nearly as extensively as under President Ben Ali. But you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence. In protest over this  blogger Slim Amamou  who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution  he resigned in protest from the cabinet. But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem. In fact  on Twitter  there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said   Well actually  we do want democracy and free expression  but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy. But the problem is  how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power  As Riadh Guerfali  the veteran digital activist from Tunisia  remarked over this incident   Before  things were simple  you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other. Today  things are a lot more subtle.  Welcome to democracy  our Tunisian and Egyptian friends. The reality is that even in democratic societies today  we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks. In fact  in the United States  whatever you may think of Julian Assange  even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks. Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman  despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged  let alone convicted  of any crime. So we assume that the Internet is a border busting technology. This is a map of social networks worldwide  and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world    which is either a good or a bad thing  depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service. But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace. In Brazil and Japan  it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons. But if you look at China  Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states  what's happening there is more troubling. You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where  effectively  the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government. Now in China  you have the  great firewall   as it's well known  that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google  and many of the other overseas websites. And that's done in part with the help from Western technology. But that's only half of the story. The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet  known as a system of self discipline. In plain English  that means censorship and surveillance of their users. And this is a ceremony I actually attended in      where the Internet Society of China presented awards to the top    Chinese companies that are best at exercising self discipline    i.e. policing their content. And Robin Li  CEO of Baidu  China's dominant search engine  was one of the recipients. In Russia  they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites. But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti corruption site. And earlier this year  there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money. This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable. So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet  which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services. So the important question  I think  is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys. Of course  it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is. The most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citizen centric manner. Because I think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens  and I would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives  not to manipulate or enslave us. So the question is  we know how to hold government accountable. We don't necessarily always do it very well  but we have a sense of what the models are  politically and institutionally  to do that. How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit  And government regulation often isn't helping all that much. You have situations  for instance  in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO's of Internet companies   We're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest.  But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous  three strikes  law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing  which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications  and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens. And here in the United Kingdom there's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior. So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen centric Internet in the future  we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement. After all  companies didn't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course  or employing    year olds as a matter of course  just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do. It was the result of decades of sustained activism  shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy. Similarly  governments don't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day. It's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations  and that you get the right corporate behavior. We need to make the same approach with the Internet. We also are going to need political innovation. Eight hundred years ago  approximately  the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well  and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta  which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules. This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation  which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed    which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond. So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked. And what does that look like  At the moment  we still don't know. But it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics  on geopolitics  but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management  investor behavior  consumer choice and even software design and engineering. Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around. Thank you very much. Have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim majority countries over the course of the last decade  Have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around  Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings and thought   How could we have predicted that   or  How could we have better prepared for that   Well my personal story  my personal journey  what brings me to the TED stage here today  is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening in Muslim majority countries over the course of the last decades  at least  and beyond. I want to share some of that story with you  but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim majority societies. So let me begin by first of all giving a very  very brief history of time  if I may indulge. In medieval societies there were defined allegiances. An identity was defined primarily by religion. And then we moved on into an era in the   th century with the rise of a European nation state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity. So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity  and the nation state reflected that. In the age of globalization  we moved on. I call it the era of citizenship    where people could be from multi racial  multi ethnic backgrounds  but all be equal as citizens in a state. You could be American Italian  you could be American Irish  you could be British Pakistani. But I believe now that we're moving into a new age  and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as  the age of behavior.  How I define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances  where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives. And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave. Now this is not all necessarily good news  because it's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love. But actually it's my belief that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior  up until now  up until recent times  up until the last six months  the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances  using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies  those who've been benefiting from this have been extremists. And that's something which I'd like to elaborate on. If we look at Islamists  if we look at the phenomenon of far right fascists  one thing they've been very good at  one thing that they've actually been exceeding in  is communicating across borders  using technologies to organize themselves  to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena. Now I should know  because for    years of my life  I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization. And I was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders  and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism as distinct from Islam the faith  and the way in which it influenced my co religionists across the world. And my story  my personal story  is truly evidence for the age of behavior that I'm attempting to elaborate upon here. I was  by the way    I'm an Essex lad  born and raised in Essex in the U.K. Anyone who's from England knows the reputation we have from Essex. But having been born in Essex  at the age of     I joined an organization. At the age of     I was recruiting people from Cambridge University to this organization. At the age of     I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K. At the age of     I was co founding this organization in Pakistan. At the age of     I was co founding this organization in Denmark. By the age of     I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt  being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments  being subjected to torture in Egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience. Now that journey  and what took me from Essex all the way across the world    by the way  we were laughing at democratic activists. We felt they were from the age of yesteryear. We felt that they were out of date. I learned how to use email from the extremist organization that I used. I learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected. Eventually I was detected  of course  in Egypt. But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation state. The age of behavior  where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances. So as I said  we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it. And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this. But even if you look across the mood music in Europe of late  far right fascism is also on the rise. A form of anti Islam rhetoric is also on the rise and it's transnational. And the consequences that this is having is that it's affecting the political climate across Europe. What's actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms  individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another  have become interconnected in a globalized way and have thus become  or are becoming  mainstream. Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world. If you look at the rise of far right fascism across Europe of late  you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics  yet the phenomenon is transnational. In certain countries  mosque minarets are being banned. In others  headscarves are being banned. In others  kosher and halal meat are being banned  as we speak. And on the flip side  we have transnational Islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies. And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream. Now that never would have been possible before. They would have felt isolated  until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon. Where does that leave democracy aspirants  Well I believe they're getting left far behind. And I'll give you an example here at this stage. If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot  there's a man called Anwar al Awlaki. As an American citizen  ethnically a Yemeni  in hiding currently in Yemen  who inspired a Nigerian  son of the head of Nigeria's national bank. This Nigerian student studied in London  trained in Yemen  boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America. In the meanwhile  the Old mentality with a capital O  was represented by his father  the head of the Nigerian bank  warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack  and this warning fell on deaf ears. The Old mentality with a capital O  as represented by the nation state  not yet fully into the age of behavior  not recognizing the power of transnational social movements  got left behind. And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the United States of America. Again with the example of the far right  that we find  ironically  xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization. So why are they succeeding  And why are democracy aspirants falling behind  Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this. And a social movement is comprised  in my view  it's comprised of four main characteristics. It's comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders. I'll talk you through one example  and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of  and that's the example of Al Qaeda. If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al Qaeda  that's something that comes to your mind immediately. If I ask you to think of their narratives    the West being at war with Islam  the need to defend Islam against the West    these narratives  they come to your mind immediately. Incidentally  the difference between ideas and narratives  the idea is the cause that one believes in  and the narrative is the way to sell that cause    the propaganda  if you like  of the cause. So the ideas and the narratives of Al Qaeda come to your mind immediately. If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders  they come to your mind immediately. One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently. So these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately. And that's the power of social movements. They're transnational  and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders. However  if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan  and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today  you'll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. Which means  by definition  that particular leader no longer exists. One of the problems we're facing is  in my view  that there are no globalized  youth led  grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across Muslim majority societies. There is no equivalent of the Al Qaeda  without the terrorism  for democracy across Muslim majority societies. There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground. So that begs the next question. Why is it that extremist organizations  whether of the far right or of the Islamist extremism    Islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of Islam over the rest of society    why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way  whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind  And I believe that's for four reasons. I believe  number one  it's complacency. Because those who aspire to democratic culture are in power  or have societies that are leading globalized  powerful societies  powerful countries. And that level of complacency means they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture. The second  I believe  is political correctness. That we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that    we associate believing in the universality of our values    with extremists. Yet actually  whenever we talk about human rights  we do say that human rights are universal. But actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with Islamist extremism. To go around saying that I believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism. And the third  democratic choice in Muslim majority societies has been relegated to a political choice  meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party  but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party    wanting to rule by military dictatorship. And then you have a third party saying   Vote for us  we'll establish a theocracy.  So democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies. And what happens as a result of this is  when those parties are elected  and inevitably they fail  or inevitably they make political mistakes  democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes. And then people say   We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work. Let's bring the military back again.  And the fourth reason  I believe  is what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance. What I mean by that is  if the world superpower today was a communist  it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism  than it is today with the world superpower being America  occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals. So roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice  not merely as a political choice. When talking about those reasons  let's break down certain preconceptions. Is it just about grievances  Is it just about a lack of education  Well statistically  the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated. Statistically  they are educated  on average  above the education levels of Western society. Anecdotally  we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor  well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia. His deputy  Ayman al Zawahiri  was a pediatrician    not an ill educated man. International aid and development has been going on for years  but extremism in those societies  in many of those societies  has been on the rise. And what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground  in addition to international aid  in addition to education  in addition to health. Not exclusive to these things  but in addition to them  is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground. And this is where I believe neoconservatism had it upside down. Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply led approach to impose democratic values from the top down. Whereas Islamists and far right organizations  for decades  have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots. They've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots  and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition to societies that are increasingly asking for a form of Islamism. Mass movements in Pakistan have been represented after the Arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy  rather than for a democratic uprising. Because since pre partition  they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground. And what's needed is a genuine transnational youth led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture    which is necessarily more than just elections. But without freedom of speech  you can't have free and fair elections. Without human rights  you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign. Without freedom of belief  you don't have the right to join organizations. So what's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture. What that will do is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier  where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy. Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level  rather than merely on a political level  a level above politics    movements that are not political parties  but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture. What we'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here    the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy  not for a democracy. But to get to that stage  where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric  but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship    i.e. you're voting in a democracy  in an existing democracy  and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box. To get to that stage  we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground. Now to conclude  how does that happen  Well  Egypt is a good starting point. The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning. But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt was particularly cathartic for me. What happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal  and that was to remove the leader. We need to move one step beyond that now. We need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions  loosely based political coalitions  to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground. Because it's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator. That doesn't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values. But generally  the trends that start in Egypt have historically spread across the MENA region  the Middle East and North Africa region. So when Arab socialism started in Egypt  it spread across the region. In the '  s and '  s when Islamism started in the region  it spread across the MENA region as a whole. And the aspiration that we have at the moment    as young Arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism    is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that. But that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions to building genuinely grassroots based social movements that advocate for the democratic culture. And we've made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi  where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy in for the democratic culture. And it's with that thought that I'll end. And my time is up  and thank you for your time. It's the Second World War. A German prison camp. And this man  Archie Cochrane  is a prisoner of war and a doctor  and he has a problem. The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn't really understand. The symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin. But he doesn't know whether it's an infection  whether it's to do with malnutrition. He doesn't know how to cure it. And he's operating in a hostile environment. And people do terrible things in wars. The German camp guards  they've got bored. They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun. On one particular occasion  one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory while it was full of prisoners. He said he heard suspicious laughter. And Archie Cochrane  as the camp doctor  was one of the first men in to clear up the mess. And one more thing  Archie was suffering from this illness himself. So the situation seemed pretty desperate. But Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person. He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp  and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market. Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is. Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British. It looks like crude oil. It tastes ... zesty. And importantly  it's a rich source of vitamin B  . So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups. He gives half of them vitamin C. He gives half of them vitamin B  . He very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book. And after just a few days  it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness  marmite is the cure. So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp. Now you've got to imagine at the moment    forget this photo  imagine this guy with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair. He hasn't been able to shave    a sort of Billy Connolly figure. Cochrane  he starts ranting at these Germans in this Scottish accent    in fluent German  by the way  but in a Scottish accent    and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world. And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated  and he vents his frustrations. And then he goes back to his quarters  breaks down and weeps because he's convinced that the situation is hopeless. But a young German doctor picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book and says to his colleagues   This evidence is incontrovertible. If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners  it's a war crime.  And the next morning  supplies of vitamin B   are delivered to the camp  and the prisoners begin to recover. Now I'm not telling you this story because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude  although Archie Cochrane is a dude. I'm not even telling you the story because I think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy  although I think that would also be completely awesome. I'm telling you this story because Archie Cochrane  all his life  fought against a terrible affliction  and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies. And he had a name for it. He called it the God complex. Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very  very easily. So the symptoms of the complex are  no matter how complicated the problem  you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution. Now Archie was a doctor  so he hung around with doctors a lot. And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot. Now I'm an economist  I'm not a doctor  but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists. I see it in our business leaders. I see it in the politicians we vote for    people who  in the face of an incredibly complicated world  are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works. And you know  with the future billions that we've been hearing about  the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way. Well let me give you an example. Imagine for a moment that  instead of Tim Harford in front of you  there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs. You know Hans  the Mick Jagger of TED. And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics  these amazing animations. And they are brilliant  it's wonderful work. But a typical Hans Rosling graph  think for a moment  not what it shows  but think instead about what it leaves out. So it'll show you GDP per capita  population  longevity  that's about it. So three pieces of data for each country    three pieces of data. Three pieces of data is nothing. I mean  have a look at this graph. This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo. He's at MIT. Now you won't be able to understand a word of it  but this is what it looks like. Cesar has trolled the database of over       different products  and he's used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products. And it's wonderful  wonderful work. You show all these interconnections  all these interrelations. And I think it'll be profoundly useful in understanding how it is that economies grow. Brilliant work. Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine explaining how this works. And what we learned is Cesar's work is far too good to explain in The New York Times Magazine. Five thousand products    that's still nothing. Five thousand products    imagine counting every product category in Cesar Hidalgo's data. Imagine you had one second per product category. In about the length of this session  you would have counted all      . Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart. There are         there. It would take you all day. Now imagine trying to count every different specific product and service on sale in a major economy such as Tokyo  London or New York. It's even more difficult in Edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan. If you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York    there are    billion of them    it would take you     years. This is how complex the economy we've created is. And I'm just counting toasters here. I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem. The complexity here is unbelievable. And just a piece of context    the societies in which our brains evolved had about     products and services. You could count them in five minutes. So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us. This perhaps is why we find the God complex so tempting. We tend to retreat and say   We can draw a picture  we can post some graphs  we get it  we understand how this works.  And we don't. We never do. Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here. I'm not trying to say we can't solve complicated problems in a complicated world. We clearly can. But the way we solve them is with humility    to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem solving technique that works. And we have a problem solving technique that works. Now you show me a successful complex system  and I will show you a system that has evolved through trial and error. Here's an example. This baby was produced through trial and error. I realize that's an ambiguous statement. Maybe I should clarify it. This baby is a human body  it evolved. What is evolution  Over millions of years  variation and selection  variation and selection    trial and error  trial and error. And it's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error. You could use it in an industrial context. So let's say you wanted to make detergent. Let's say you're Unilever and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool. How do you do it  Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent. You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle. You create a spray of detergent. Then the spray dries. It turns into powder. It falls to the floor. You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes. You sell it at a supermarket. You make lots of money. How do you design that nozzle  It turns out to be very important. Now if you ascribe to the God complex  what you do is you find yourself a little God. You find yourself a mathematician  you find yourself a physicist    somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid. And he will  or she will  calculate the optimal design of the nozzle. Now Unilever did this and it didn't work    too complicated. Even this problem  too complicated. But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem    trial and error  variation and selection. You take a nozzle and you create    random variations on the nozzle. You try out all     you keep the one that works best. You create    variations on that one. You try out all   . You keep the one that works best. You try out    variations on that one. You see how this works  right  And after    generations  you have this incredible nozzle. It looks a bit like a chess piece    functions absolutely brilliantly. We have no idea why it works  no idea at all. And the moment you step back from the God complex    let's just try to have a bunch of stuff  let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not    you can solve your problem. Now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize. And we've heard a lot about how economies function. The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy. How did it become the world's greatest economy  I could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the U.S. economy  but I think the most salient one is this  ten percent of American businesses disappear every year. That is a huge failure rate. It's far higher than the failure rate of  say  Americans. Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year. Which leads us to conclude American businesses fail faster than Americans  and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans. And eventually  they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets    if  of course  they haven't already done so. I sometimes wonder. But it's this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence  this incredible performance of Western economies. It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge. It's come through trial and error. Now I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months  and people sometimes say to me   Well Tim  it's kind of obvious. Obviously trial and error is very important. Obviously experimentation is very important. Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing   So I say  okay  fine. You think it's obvious  I will admit it's obvious when schools start teaching children that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer. Stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer. And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers. And if you can't find the answers  you must be lazy or stupid. When schools stop doing that all the time  I will admit that  yes  it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing. When a politician stands up campaigning for elected office and says   I want to fix our health system. I want to fix our education system. I have no idea how to do it. I have half a dozen ideas. We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail. Then we'll test some other ideas out. We'll find some that work. We'll build on those. We'll get rid of the ones that don't.     when a politician campaigns on that platform  and more importantly  when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician  then I will admit that it is obvious that trial and error works  and that    thank you. Until then  until then I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex. Because it's so hard to admit our own fallibility. It's so uncomfortable. And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody. There's this one trial he ran many years after World War II. He wanted to test out the question of  where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks  Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital  or should they recover at home  All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down. They had the God complex in spades. They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients  and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment. Nevertheless  Archie managed to get permission to do this. He ran his trial. And after the trial had been running for a little while  he gathered together all his colleagues around his table  and he said   Well  gentlemen  we have some preliminary results. They're not statistically significant. But we have something. And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong. It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home. They should be in hospital.  And there's this uproar  and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying   We always said you were unethical  Archie. You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now. Shut it down at once.  And there's this huge hubbub. Archie lets it die down. And then he says   Well that's very interesting  gentlemen  because when I gave you the table of results  I swapped the two columns around. It turns out your hospitals are killing people  and they should be at home. Would you like to close down the trial now  or should we wait until we have robust results   Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room. But Cochrane would do that kind of thing. And the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say   Here in my own little world  I am a god  I understand everything. I do not want to have my opinions challenged. I do not want to have my conclusions tested.  It feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law. Cochrane understood that uncertainty  that fallibility  that being challenged  they hurt. And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that. Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy. It isn't easy. It's incredibly painful. And since I started talking about this subject and researching this subject  I've been really haunted by something a Japanese mathematician said on the subject. So shortly after the war  this young man  Yutaka Taniyama  developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama Shimura Conjecture. It turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving Fermat's Last Theorem. In fact  it turns out it's equivalent to proving Fermat's Last Theorem. You prove one  you prove the other. But it was always a conjecture. Taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true. And shortly before his   th birthday in       Yutaka Taniyama killed himself. His friend  Goro Shimura    who worked on the mathematics with him    many decades later  reflected on Taniyama's life. He said   He was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to emulate him  but I realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes.  Thank you. Pat Mitchell  You have brought us images from the Yemen Times. And take us through those  and introduce us to another Yemen. Nadia Al Sakkaf  Well  I'm glad to be here. And I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen. This picture shows a revolution started by women  and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest. The other picture is the popularity of the real need for change. So many people are there. The intensity of the upspring. This picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training  for education. These women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the constitution. I love this picture. I just wanted to show that over    percent of the Yemeni population are    years and below. And they were excluded from decision making  and now they are in the forefront of the news  raising the flag. English    you will see  this is jeans and tights  and an English expression    the ability to share with the world what is going on in our own country. And expression also  it has brought talents. Yemenis are using cartoons and art  paintings  comics  to tell the world and each other about what's going on. Obviously  there's always the dark side of it. And this is just one of the less gruesome pictures of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay. The solidarity of millions of Yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing. And finally  lots of people are saying that Yemen's revolution is going to break the country. Is it going to be so many different countries  Is it going to be another Somalia  But we want to tell the world that  no  under the one flag  we'll still remain as Yemeni people. PM  Thank you for those images  Nadia. And they do  in many ways  tell a different story than the story of Yemen  the one that is often in the news. And yet  you yourself defy all those characterizations. So let's talk about the personal story for a moment. Your father is murdered. The Yemen Times already has a strong reputation in Yemen as an independent English language newspaper. How did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper  especially in such times of conflict  NA  Well  let me first warn you that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl. I've guessed you've already noticed this by now. In Yemen  most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life. But there's so much potential. I wish I could show you my Yemen. I wish you could see Yemen through my eyes. Then you would know that there's so much to it. And I was privileged because I was born into a family  my father would always encourage the boys and the girls. He would say we are equal. And he was such an extraordinary man. And even my mother    I owe it to my family. A story  I studied in India. And in my third year  I started becoming confused because I was Yemeni  but I was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college. And I went back home and I said   Daddy  I don't know who I am. I'm not a Yemeni  I'm not an Indian.  And he said   You are the bridge.  And that is something I will keep in my heart forever. So since then I've been the bridge  and a lot of people have walked over me. PM  I don't think so.  Laughter  NA  But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society. And when I became editor in chief after my brother actually    my father passed away in       and then my brother until         and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.  What's this young girl coming in and showing off because it's her family business   or something. It was very hard at first. I didn't want to clash with people. But with all due respect to all the men  and the older men especially  they did not want me around. It was very hard  you know  to impose my authority. But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do. And in the first year  I had to fire half of the men. Brought in more women. Brought in younger men. And we have a more gender balanced newsroom today. The other thing is that it's about professionalism. It's about proving who you are and what you can do. And I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now  but in      alone  we won three international awards. One of them is the IPI Free Media Pioneer Award. So that was the answer to all the Yemeni people. And I want to score a point here  because my husband is in the room over there. If you could please stand up   unclear . He has been very supportive of me. PM  And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper. But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have  you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper. And so along with changing who worked there  you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into  in particular with women  and it has to do with outside image  dress  the veiled woman. So how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you  NA  As you know  the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered  veiled women. And this is true. And a lot of it is because women are not able  are not free  to show their face to their self. It's a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men  the grandparents and so on. And it's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say   I am as much contributing to this family  or more  than you are.  And the more empowered the women become  the more they are able to remove the veil  for example  or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel. So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil  and it's economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it. And I have done this throughout my work. I've tried to encourage young girls. We started with  you can take it off in the office. And then after that  you can take it off on assignments. Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with    how can you talk to people if you have your face covered     and so on  it's just a movement. And I am a role model in Yemen. A lot of people look up to me. A lot of young girls look up to me. And I need to prove to them that  yes  you can still be married  you can still be a mother  and you can still be respected within the society  but at the same time  that doesn't mean you  should  just be one of the crowd. You can be yourself and have your face. PM  But by putting yourself personally out there    both projecting a different image of Yemeni women  but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper    has this put you in personal danger  NA  Well the Yemen Times  across    years  has been through so much. We've suffered prosecution  the paper was closed down more than three times. It's an independent newspaper  but tell that to the people in charge. They think that if there's anything against them  then we are being an opposition newspaper. And very  very difficult times. Some of my reporters were arrested. We had some court cases. My father was assassinated. Today  we are in a much better situation. We've created the credibility. And in times of revolution or change like today  it is very important for independent media to have a voice. It's very important for you to go to YemenTimes.com  and it's very important to listen to our voice. And this is probably something I'm going to share with you in Western media probably    and how there's a lot of stereotypes    thinking of Yemen in one single frame  this is what Yemen is all about. And that's not fair. It's not fair for me  it's not fair for my country. A lot of reporters come to Yemen and they want to write a story on Al Qaeda or terrorism. And I just wanted to share with you  there's one reporter that came. He wanted to do a documentary on what his editors wanted. And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me    hip hop    that there are young Yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu. That thing.  PM  Rap. Break dancing.  Yeah  break dancing. I'm not so old. I'm just not in touch. PM  Yes  you are. Actually  that's a documentary that's available online  the video's online. NA  ShaketheDust.org. PM   Shake the Dust.   NA   Shake the Dust.   PM  ShaketheDust.org. And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen. You spoke about the responsibility of the press. And certainly  when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we've created fear and danger  often from lack of knowledge  lack of real understanding  how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region  but in particular  in your country  NA  Well there is a saying that says   You fear what you don't know  and you hate what you fear.  So it's about the lack of research  basically. It's almost   Do your homework      some involvement. And you cannot do parachute reporting    just jump into a country for two days and think that you've done your homework and a story. So I wish that the world would know my Yemen  my country  my people. I am an example  and there are others like me. We may not be that many  but if we are promoted as a good  positive example  there will be others    men and women    who can eventually bridge the gap    again  coming to the bridge    between Yemen and the world and telling first about recognition and then about communication and compassion. I think Yemen is going to be in a very bad situation in the next two or three years. It's natural. But after the two years  which is a price we are willing to pay  we are going to stand up again on our feet  but in the new Yemen with a younger and more empowered people    democratic. PM  Nadia  I think you've just given us a very different view of Yemen. And certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for. And the very best of luck to you. YemenTimes.com. NA  On Twitter also. PM  So you are plugged in. I love the Internet. It's true. Think about everything it has brought us. Think about all the services we use  all the connectivity  all the entertainment  all the business  all the commerce. And it's happening during our lifetimes. I'm pretty sure that one day we'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now. This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online  the generation that built something really and truly global. But yes  it's also true that the Internet has problems  very serious problems  problems with security and problems with privacy. I've spent my career fighting these problems. So let me show you something. This here is Brain. This is a floppy disk    five and a quarter inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A. It's the first virus we ever found for PC computers. And we actually know where Brain came from. We know because it says so inside the code. Let's take a look. All right. That's the boot sector of an infected floppy  and if we take a closer look inside  we'll see that right there  it says   Welcome to the dungeon.  And then it continues  saying        Basit and Amjad. And Basit and Amjad are first names  Pakistani first names. In fact  there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan. Now      . Now it's     . That's    years ago. The PC virus problem is    years old now. So half a year ago  I decided to go to Pakistan myself. So let's see  here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan. This is from the city of Lahore  which is around     kilometers south from Abbottabad  where Bin Laden was caught. Here's a typical street view. And here's the street or road leading to this building  which is     Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town. And I knocked on the door. You want to guess who opened the door  Basit and Amjad  they are still there. So here standing up is Basit. Sitting down is his brother Amjad. These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus. Now of course  we had a very interesting discussion. I asked them why. I asked them how they feel about what they started. And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years. So there is some sort of justice in the world after all. Now  the viruses that we used to see in the     s and     s obviously are not a problem any more. So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like. What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age old programs on a modern computer. So let me just mount some drives. Go over there. What we have here is a list of old viruses. So let me just run some viruses on my computer. For example  let's go with the Centipede virus first. And you can see at the top of the screen  there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one. You know that you're infected because it actually shows up. Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash  invented in Russia in     . Let me show you one which actually makes some sound. And the last example  guess what the Walker virus does  Yes  there's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected. So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus  when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers. Today  they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers. Today  viruses are a global problem. What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs  where we track virus infections worldwide. So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere. In fact  if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web  we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses  how many new examples of malware we find every single day. Here's the latest virus we've found  in a file called Server.exe. And we found it right over here three seconds ago    the previous one  six seconds ago. And if we just scroll around  it's just massive. We find tens of thousands  even hundreds of thousands. And that's the last    minutes of malware every single day. So where are all these coming from then  Well today  it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses. It's gangs like    let's go to GangstaBucks.com. This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers. So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers  but you don't know what to do with them  you can sell those infected computers    somebody else's computers    to these guys. And they'll actually pay you money for those computers. So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers  Well there's multiple different ways  such as banking trojans  which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking  or keyloggers. Keyloggers silently sit on your computer  hidden from view  and they record everything you type. So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches. Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals. Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals. Same thing with every single password and so on. But the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store. Because when you do purchases in online stores  you will be typing in your name  the delivery address  your credit card number and the credit card security codes. And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago. That's the credit card number  that's the expiration date  that's the security code  and that's the name of the owner of the card. Once you gain access to other people's credit card information  you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information. And that  obviously  is a problem. We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime. One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations  we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons. We find guys like Bjorn Sundin  originally from Sweden  and his partner in crime  also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages  Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain  a U.S. citizen. These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.  a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions. They are both right now on the run. Nobody knows where they are. U.S. officials  just a couple of weeks ago  froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain  and that bank account had   .  million U.S. dollars on it. So the amount of money online crime generates is significant. And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks. We know that online criminals are hiring programmers  hiring testing people  testing their code  having back end systems with SQL databases. And they can afford to watch how we work    like how security people work    and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build. They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage. I mean  the Internet is international. That's why we call it the Internet. And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world  here's a video built by Clarified Networks  which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world. This operation  believed to be originally from Estonia  moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down. So you just can't shut these guys down. They will switch from one country to another  from one jurisdiction to another    moving around the world  using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world. Now  criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us. So how do you actually go around finding online criminals  How do you actually track them down  Let me give you an example. What we have here is one exploit file. Here  I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file  which contains an exploit. And that basically means  if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer  it actually takes over your computer and runs code. Now  if you'll take a look at this image file    well there's the image header  and there the actual code of the attack starts. And that code has been encrypted  so let's decrypt it. It has been encrypted with XOR function   . You just have to believe me  it is  it is. And we can go here and actually start decrypting it. Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted. And I know  it doesn't really look much different from the original. But just keep staring at it. You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address  unionseek.com d ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program. And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer. But even more interestingly  if we continue decrypting  we'll find this mysterious string  which says O   KO  RUS. That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature. It's not used for anything. And I was looking at that  trying to figure out what it means. So obviously I Googled for it. I got zero hits  wasn't there. So I spoke with the guys at the lab. And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs  and one of them mentioned  well  it ends in RUS like Russia. And    is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg. For example  you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that. So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg  and through a long road  we eventually found this one particular website. Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website  and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal. And on this blog  he blogs about his life  about his life in St. Petersburg    he's in his early   s    about his cat  about his girlfriend. And he drives a very nice car. In fact  this guy drives a Mercedes Benz S    V   with a six liter engine with more than     horsepower. Now that's a nice car for a    something year old kid in St. Petersburg. How do I know about this car  Because he blogged about the car. He actually had a car accident. In downtown St. Petersburg  he actually crashed his car into another car. And he put blogged images about the car accident    that's his Mercedes    right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into. And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in   RUS. And if you actually take a look at the scene picture  you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O   KO  RUS. Now I'm not a lawyer  but if I would be  this is where I would say   I rest my case.  So what happens when online criminals are caught  Well in most cases it never gets this far. The vast majority of the online crime cases  we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from. And even if we are able to find online criminals  quite often there is no outcome. The local police don't act  or if they do  there's not enough evidence  or for some reason we can't take them down. I wish it would be easier  unfortunately it isn't. But things are also changing at a very rapid pace. You've all heard about things like Stuxnet. So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these. That's a Siemens S      PLC  programmable logic  controller . And this is what runs our infrastructure. This is what runs everything around us. PLC's  these small boxes which have no display  no keyboard  which are programmed  are put in place  and they do their job. For example  the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these. And when Stuxnet infects one of these  that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about. Because everything around us is being run by these. I mean  we have critical infrastructure. You go to any factory  any power plant  any chemical plant  any food processing plant  you look around    everything is being run by computers. Everything is being run by computers. Everything is reliant on these computers working. We have become very reliant on Internet  on basic things like electricity  obviously  on computers working. And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us. We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail. So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there. It's actually very basic stuff    thinking about continuity  thinking about backups  thinking about the things that actually matter. Now I told you    I love the Internet. I do. Think about all the services we have online. Think about if they are taken away from you  if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another. I see beauty in the future of the Internet  but I'm worried that we might not see that. I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime. Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us. I've spent my life defending the Net  and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime  we are running a risk of losing it all. We have to do this globally  and we have to do it right now. What we need is more global  international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs    these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks. That's much more important than running anti viruses or running firewalls. What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks  and even more importantly  we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime  but haven't yet done it. We have to find the people with the skills  but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good. Thank you very much. Embracing otherness. When I first heard this theme  I thought  well  embracing otherness is embracing myself. And the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me  and it's given me an insight into the whole notion of self  which I think is worth sharing with you today. We each have a self  but I don't think that we're born with one. You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything  they're not separate  Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly. It's like that initial stage is over    oneness  infancy  unformed  primitive. It's no longer valid or real. What is real is separateness  and at some point in early babyhood  the idea of self starts to form. Our little portion of oneness is given a name  is told all kinds of things about itself  and these details  opinions and ideas become facts  which go towards building ourselves  our identity. And that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world. But the self is a projection based on other people's projections. Is it who we really are  Or who we really want to be  or should be  So this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up. The self that I attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again. And my panic at not having a self that fit  and the confusion that came from my self being rejected  created anxiety  shame and hopelessness  which kind of defined me for a long time. But in retrospect  the destruction of my self was so repetitive that I started to see a pattern. The self changed  got affected  broken  destroyed  but another one would evolve    sometimes stronger  sometimes hateful  sometimes not wanting to be there at all. The self was not constant. And how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place  I grew up on the coast of England in the '  s. My dad is white from Cornwall  and my mom is black from Zimbabwe. Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people. But nature had its wicked way  and brown babies were born. But from about the age of five  I was aware that I didn't fit. I was the black atheist kid in the all white Catholic school run by nuns. I was an anomaly  and my self was rooting around for definition and trying to plug in. Because the self likes to fit  to see itself replicated  to belong. That confirms its existence and its importance. And it is important. It has an extremely important function. Without it  we literally can't interface with others. We can't hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity  of success. But my skin color wasn't right. My hair wasn't right. My history wasn't right. My self became defined by otherness  which meant that  in that social world  I didn't really exist. And I was  other  before being anything else    even before being a girl. I was a noticeable nobody. Another world was opening up around this time  performance and dancing. That nagging dread of self hood didn't exist when I was dancing. I'd literally lose myself. And I was a really good dancer. I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing. I could be in the movement in a way that I wasn't able to be in my real life  in myself. And at     I stumbled across another opportunity  and I earned my first acting role in a film. I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting. My dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self  not my own  and it felt so good. It was the first time that I existed inside a fully functioning self    one that I controlled  that I steered  that I gave life to. But the shooting day would end  and I'd return to my gnarly  awkward self. By     I was a fully fledged movie actor  but still searching for definition. I applied to read anthropology at university. Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview  and she asked me   How would you define race   Well  I thought I had the answer to that one  and I said   Skin color.   So biology  genetics   she said.  Because  Thandie  that's not accurate. Because there's actually more genetic difference between a black Kenyan and a black Ugandan than there is between a black Kenyan and  say  a white Norwegian. Because we all stem from Africa. So in Africa  there's been more time to create genetic diversity.  In other words  race has no basis in biological or scientific fact. On the one hand  result. Right  On the other hand  my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility. But what was credible  what is biological and scientific fact  is that we all stem from Africa    in fact  from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived         years ago. And race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance. Strangely  these revelations didn't cure my low self esteem  that feeling of otherness. My desire to disappear was still very powerful. I had a degree from Cambridge  I had a thriving career  but my self was a car crash  and I wound up with bulimia and on a therapist's couch. And of course I did. I still believed my self was all I was. I still valued self worth above all other worth  and what was there to suggest otherwise  We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self. Look at the industry for self image and the jobs it creates  the revenue it turns over. We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing. But it's not. It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death. But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection    and that thing is oneness  our essence. The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator    to you and to me. And that can happen with awareness    awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self hood. For a start  we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves. It happens when I dance  when I'm acting. I'm earthed in my essence  and my self is suspended. In those moments  I'm connected to everything    the ground  the air  the sounds  the energy from the audience. All my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel    that feeling of oneness. And when I'm acting a role  I inhabit another self  and I give it life for awhile  because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment. And I've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to Secretary of State in     . And no matter how other these selves might be  they're all related in me. And I honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure. I always wondered why I could feel others' pain so deeply  why I could recognize the somebody in the nobody. It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way. I thought I lacked substance  and the fact that I could feel others' meant that I had nothing of myself to feel. The thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of enlightenment. And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function  a funny thing happened. I stopped giving it so much authority. I give it its due. I take it to therapy. I've become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior. But I'm not ashamed of my self. In fact  I respect my self and its function. And over time and with practice  I've tried to live more and more from my essence. And if you can do that  incredible things happen. I was in Congo in February  dancing and celebrating with women who've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways    destroyed because other brutalized  psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves' addiction to iPods  Pads  and bling  which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain  their suffering  their death. Because  hey  if we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life  then we're devaluing and desensitizing life. And in that disconnected state  yeah  we can build factory farms with no windows  destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war. So here's a note to self  The cracks have started to show in our constructed world  and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks  and oil and blood  rivers of it. Crucially  we haven't been figuring out how to live in oneness with the Earth and every other living thing. We've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other    billions of each other. Only we're not living with each other  our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection. Let's live with each other and take it a breath at a time. If we can get under that heavy self  light a torch of awareness  and find our essence  our connection to the infinite and every other living thing. We knew it from the day we were born. Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness. It's more a reality than the ones our selves have created. Imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self  appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next. Simple awareness is where it begins. Thank you for listening. This is a photograph by the artist Michael Najjar  and it's real  in the sense that he went there to Argentina to take the photo. But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that. And what he's done is he's actually reshaped  digitally  all of the contours of the mountains to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index. So what you see  that precipice  that high precipice with the valley  is the      financial crisis. The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there. I don't know where we are now. This is the Hang Seng index for Hong Kong. And similar topography. I wonder why. And this is art. This is metaphor. But I think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth  and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math    not just financial math  but math in general. That its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it    the world around us and the world inside us. And it's specifically algorithms  which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff. They acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again  and they ossify and calcify  and they become real. And I was thinking about this  of all places  on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago  because I happened to be seated next to a Hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the Cold War for physicists in Hungary. And I said   So what were you doing   And he said   Well we were mostly breaking stealth.  And I said   That's a good job. That's interesting. How does that work   And to understand that  you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works. And so    this is an over simplification    but basically  it's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through     tons of steel in the sky. It's not just going to disappear. But if you can take this big  massive thing  and you could turn it into a million little things    something like a flock of birds    well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky. And if you're a radar  that's a really bad job. And he said   Yeah.  He said   But that's if you're a radar. So we didn't use a radar  we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals  electronic communication. And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication  we thought  'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'  And I said   Yeah. That's good. So you've effectively negated    years of aeronautic research. What's your act two  What do you do when you grow up   And he said   Well  financial services.  And I said   Oh.  Because those had been in the news lately. And I said   How does that work   And he said   Well there's       physicists on Wall Street now  and I'm one of them.  And I said   What's the black box for Wall Street   And he said   It's funny you ask that  because it's actually called black box trading. And it's also sometimes called algo trading  algorithmic trading.  And algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the United States Air Force had  which is that they're moving these positions    whether it's Proctor   Gamble or Accenture  whatever    they're moving a million shares of something through the market. And if they do that all at once  it's like playing poker and going all in right away. You just tip your hand. And so they have to find a way    and they use algorithms to do this    to break up that big thing into a million little transactions. And the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what's actually happening in the market. So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now  what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide  and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act. And all of that's great  and it's fine. And that's    percent of the United States stock market     percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension  your mortgage. And what could go wrong  What could go wrong is that a year ago  nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes  and they called it the Flash Crash of     . All of a sudden  nine percent just goes away  and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it  nobody asked for it. Nobody had any control over what was actually happening. All they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said   Stop.  And that's the thing  is that we're writing things  we're writing these things that we can no longer read. And we've rendered something illegible  and we've lost the sense of what's actually happening in this world that we've made. And we're starting to make our way. There's a company in Boston called Nanex  and they use math and magic and I don't know what  and they reach into all the market data and they find  actually sometimes  some of these algorithms. And when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies. And they do what we've always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand    which is that they give them a name and a story. So this is one that they found  they called the Knife  the Carnival  the Boston Shuffler  Twilight. And the gag is that  of course  these aren't just running through the market. You can find these kinds of things wherever you look  once you learn how to look for them. You can find it here  this book about flies that you may have been looking at on Amazon. You may have noticed it when its price started at  .  million dollars. It's out of print    still ... If you had bought it at  .   it would have been a bargain. A few hours later  it had gone up to   .  million dollars  plus shipping and handling. And the question is  Nobody was buying or selling anything  what was happening  And you see this behavior on Amazon as surely as you see it on Wall Street. And when you see this kind of behavior  what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict  algorithms locked in loops with each other  without any human oversight  without any adult supervision to say   Actually   .  million is plenty.  And as with Amazon  so it is with Netflix. And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. They started with Cinematch  and they've tried a bunch of others    there's Dinosaur Planet  there's Gravity. They're using Pragmatic Chaos now. Pragmatic Chaos is  like all of Netflix algorithms  trying to do the same thing. It's trying to get a grasp on you  on the firmware inside the human skull  so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next    which is a very  very difficult problem. But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down  it doesn't take away from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has. Pragmatic Chaos  like all Netflix algorithms  determines  in the end     percent of what movies end up being rented. So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for    percent of those movies. But what if you could rate those movies before they get made  Wouldn't that be handy  Well  a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood  and they have  story algorithms     a company called Epagogix. And you can run your script through there  and they can tell you  quantifiably  that that's a    million dollar movie or a     million dollar movie. And the thing is  is that this isn't Google. This isn't information. These aren't financial stats  this is culture. And what you see here  or what you don't really see normally  is that these are the physics of culture. And if these algorithms  like the algorithms on Wall Street  just crashed one day and went awry  how would we know  What would it look like  And they're in your house. They're in your house. These are two algorithms competing for your living room. These are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means. And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them  and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom. And the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far fetched. It's super real and it's happening around you. You feel it most when you're in a sealed metal box  a new style elevator  they're called destination control elevators. These are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to before you get in the elevator. And it uses what's called a bin packing algorithm. So none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want. Everybody who wants to go to the   th floor goes into car two  and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five. And the problem with that is that people freak out. People panic. And you see why. You see why. It's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation  like the buttons. Like the things that people use. All it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says   Stop.  And this is what we're designing for. We're designing for this machine dialect. And how far can you take that  How far can you take it  You can take it really  really far. So let me take it back to Wall Street. Because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else  which is speed. And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds. And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are  it takes you         microseconds just to click a mouse. But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're five microseconds behind  you're a loser. So if you were an algorithm  you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper    throwing out all the furniture  all the infrastructure for human use  and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in    all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet. And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system. And of course  it is  but it's distributed from places. In New York  this is where it's distributed from  the Carrier Hotel located on Hudson Street. And this is really where the wires come right up into the city. And the reality is that the further away you are from that  you're a few microseconds behind every time. These guys down on Wall Street  Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation  they're eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the Carrier Hotel. And that's going to keep happening. We're going to keep hollowing them out  because you  inch for inch and pound for pound and dollar for dollar  none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space like the Boston Shuffler could. But if you zoom out  if you zoom out  you would see an     mile trench between New York City and Chicago that's been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks. This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal    times faster than you can click a mouse    just for these algorithms  just for the Carnival and the Knife. And when you think about this  that we're running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal three microseconds faster  all for a communications framework that no human will ever know  that's a kind of manifest destiny  and we'll always look for a new frontier. Unfortunately  we have our work cut out for us. This is just theoretical. This is some mathematicians at MIT. And the truth is I don't really understand a lot of what they're talking about. It involves light cones and quantum entanglement  and I don't really understand any of that. But I can read this map  and what this map says is that  if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are  that's where people are  where the cities are  you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively. And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean. So that's what we'll do  we'll build bubbles or something  or platforms. We'll actually part the water to pull money out of the air  because it's a bright future if you're an algorithm. And it's not the money that's so interesting actually. It's what the money motivates  that we're actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. And in that light  you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs  and you realize that they're not metaphor  they're prophecy. They're prophecy for the kind of seismic  terrestrial effects of the math that we're making. And the landscape was always made by this sort of weird  uneasy collaboration between nature and man. But now there's this third co evolutionary force  algorithms    the Boston Shuffler  the Carnival. And we will have to understand those as nature  and in a way  they are. Thank you. It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird. Birds are very agile. They fly  not with rotating components  so they fly only by flapping their wings. So we looked at the birds  and we tried to make a model that is powerful  ultralight  and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings. So what would be better than to use the herring gull  in its freedom  circling and swooping over the sea  and to use this as a role model  So we bring a team together. There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics  in the field of building gliders. And the task was to build an ultralight indoor flying model that is able to fly over your heads. So be careful later on. And this was one issue  to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down. So why do we do all this  We are a company in the field of automation  and we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient  and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena. So I now would like you to put your seat belts on and put your hats on. So maybe we'll try it once    to fly a SmartBird. Thank you. So we can now look at the SmartBird. So here is one without a skin. We have a wingspan of about two meters. The length is one meter and six  and the weight is only     grams. And it is all out of carbon fiber. In the middle we have a motor  and we also have a gear in it  and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor. So within the motor  we have three Hall sensors  so we know exactly where the wing is. And if we now beat up and down    We have the possibility to fly like a bird. So if you go down  you have the large area of propulsion  and if you go up  the wings are not that large  and it is easier to get up. So  the next thing we did  or the challenges we did  was to coordinate this movement. We have to turn it  go up and go down. We have a split wing. With the split wing  we get the lift at the upper wing  and we get the propulsion at the lower wing. Also  we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency. We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency. So therefore  it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion  from    percent up to    percent. Next thing we have to do  we have to control and regulate the whole structure. Only if you control and regulate it  you will get that aerodynamic efficiency. So the overall consumption of energy is about    watts at takeoff and    to    watts in flight. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Markus  we should fly it once more. Markus Fischer  Yeah  sure. The question today is not  Why did we invade Afghanistan  The question is  why are we still in Afghanistan one decade later  Why are we spending      billion  Why have we got         troops on the ground  Why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict  How has this happened  The last    years has been the age of intervention  and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five act tragedy. We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair. We faced Rwanda  we faced Bosnia  and then we rediscovered our confidence. In the third act  we went into Bosnia and Kosovo and we seemed to succeed. In the fourth act  with our hubris  our overconfidence developing  we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan  and in the fifth act  we plunged into a humiliating mess. So the question is  What are we doing  Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan  And the answer  of course  that we keep being given is as follows  we're told that we went into Afghanistan because of       and that we remain there because the Taliban poses an existential threat to global security. In the words of President Obama   If the Taliban take over again  they will invite back Al Qaeda  who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.  The story that we're told is that there was a  light footprint  initially    in other words  that we ended up in a situation where we didn't have enough troops  we didn't have enough resources  that Afghans were frustrated    they felt there wasn't enough progress and economic development and security  and therefore the Taliban came back    that we responded in      and      with troop deployments  but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground. And that it wasn't until       when President Obama signed off on a surge  that we finally had  in the words of Secretary Clinton   the strategy  the leadership and the resources.  So  as the president now reassures us  we are on track to achieve our goals. All of this is wrong. Every one of those statements is wrong. Afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security. It is extremely unlikely the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country    extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul. They simply don't have a conventional military option. And even if they were able to do so  even if I'm wrong  it's extremely unlikely the Taliban would invite back Al Qaeda. From the Taliban's point of view  that was their number one mistake last time. If they hadn't invited back Al Qaeda  they would still be in power today. And even if I'm wrong about those two things  even if they were able to take back the country  even if they were to invite back Al Qaeda  it's extremely unlikely that Al Qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the United States or harm Europe. Because this isn't the     s anymore. If the Al Qaeda base was to be established near Ghazni  we would hit them very hard  and it would be very  very difficult for the Taliban to protect them. Furthermore  it's simply not true that what went wrong in Afghanistan is the light footprint. In my experience  in fact  the light footprint was extremely helpful. And these troops that we brought in    it's a great picture of David Beckham there on the sub machine gun    made the situation worse  not better. When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of            what I saw was scenes like this. A girl  if you're lucky  in the corner of a dark room    lucky to be able to look at the Koran. But in those early days when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources  we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan. Within a few months  there were two and a half million more girls in school. In Sangin where I was sick in       the nearest health clinic was within three days walk. Today  there are    health clinics in that area alone. There was amazing improvements. We went from almost no Afghans having mobile telephones during the Taliban to a situation where  almost overnight  three million Afghans had mobile telephones. And we had progress in the free media. We had progress in elections    all of this with the so called light footprint. But when we began to bring more money  when we began to invest more resources  things got worse  not better. How  Well first see  if you put     billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year  you drown everything. It's not simply corruption and waste that you create  you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government  the elected Afghan government  with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours with their own priorities. And the same is true for the troops. When I walked across Afghanistan  I stayed with people like this. This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj. Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host. He was very generous  like many of the Afghans I stayed with. But he was also considerably more conservative  considerably more anti foreign  considerably more Islamist than we'd like to acknowledge. This man  for example  Mullah Mustafa  tried to shoot me. And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is I was somewhat frightened  and I was too afraid on this occasion to ask him  having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house  why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me. But    months later  I asked him why he had tried to shoot me. And Mullah Mustafa    he's the man with the pen and paper    explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph  Nadir Shah had bet him that he couldn't hit me. Now this is not to say Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa. It's not  it's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence. But it is a place where the putting in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it.       Anthony Fitzherbert  an agricultural engineer  could travel through Helmand  could stay in Nad Ali  Sangin and Ghoresh  which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place. Today  he could never do that. So the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the Taliban insurgency is mistaken. Rather than preceding the insurgency  the Taliban followed the troop deployment  and as far as I'm concerned  the troop deployment caused their return. Now is this a new idea  No  there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years. I ran a center at Harvard from      to       and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently  who've traveled to almost every district in the country. Andrew Wilder  for example  born on the Pakistan Iranian border  served his whole life in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Paul Fishstein who began working there in         worked for Save the Children  ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit. These are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making Afghanistan less secure  not more secure    that the counter insurgency strategy was not working and would not work. And yet  nobody listened to them. Instead  there was a litany of astonishing optimism. Beginning in       every general came in saying   I've inherited a dismal situation  but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy  which will deliver   in General Barno's word in       the  decisive year.  Well guess what  It didn't. But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying that he had the strategy and the resources to deliver  in       the  decisive year.  Or General David Richards to come in      and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the  crunch year.  Or in       the Norwegian deputy foreign minister  Espen Eide  to say that that would deliver the  decisive year.  Or in       Major General Champoux to come in and say he would deliver the  decisive year.  Or in       my great friend  General Stanley McChrystal  who said that he was  knee deep in the decisive year.  Or in       the U.K. foreign secretary  David Miliband  who said that at last we would deliver the  decisive year.  And you'll be delighted to hear in       today  that Guido Westerwelle  the German foreign minister  assures us that we are in the  decisive year.  How do we allow any of this to happen  Well the answer  of course  is  if you spend     billion or     billion dollars a year in a country  you co opt almost everybody. Even the aid agencies  who begin to receive an enormous amount of money from the U.S. and the European governments to build schools and clinics  are somewhat disinclined to challenge the idea that Afghanistan is an existential threat to global security. They're worried  in other words  that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat    Oxfam  Save the Children wouldn't get the money to build their hospitals and schools. It's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest. It's very difficult for a politician  because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain. You feel deep  deep guilt. You exaggerate your fears  and you're terrified about the humiliation of defeat. What is the solution to this  Well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like Michael Semple  or those other people  who are telling the truth  who know the country  who've spent    years on the ground    and most importantly of all  the missing component of this    Afghans themselves  who understand what is going on. We need to somehow get their message to the policymakers. And this is very difficult to do because of our structures. The first thing we need to change is the structures of our government. Very  very sadly  our foreign services  the United Nations  the military in these countries have very little idea of what's going on. The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months  Italian soldiers  on tours of four months  the American military  on tours of    months. Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds. When they go out  they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready    hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour. In the British embassy in Afghanistan in       an embassy of     people  there were only three people who could speak Dari  the main language of Afghanistan  at a decent level. And there was not a single Pashto speaker. In the Afghan section in London responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground  I was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a posting in Afghanistan. So we need to change that institutional culture. And I could make the same points about the United States and the United Nations. Secondly  we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals. We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious  that we understand that optimism is in the DNA of the military  that we don't respond to it with quite as much alacrity. And thirdly  we need to have some humility. We need to begin from the position that our knowledge  our power  our legitimacy is limited. This doesn't mean that intervention around the world is a disaster. It isn't. Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes  great successes. Today when you go to Bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early     s happened. It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made since     . Refugee return  which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees thought would be extremely unlikely  has largely happened. A million properties have been returned. Borders between the Bosniak territory and the Bosnian Serb territory have calmed down. The national army has shrunk. The crime rates in Bosnia today are lower than they are in Sweden. This has been done by an incredible  principled effort by the international community  and  of course  above all  by Bosnians themselves. But you need to look at context. And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq. You need to understand that in those places what really mattered was  firstly  the role of Tudman and Milosevic in coming to the agreement  and then the fact those men went  that the regional situation improved  that the European Union could offer Bosnia something extraordinary  the chance to be part of a new thing  a new club  a chance to join something bigger. And finally  we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo  a lot of the secret of what we did  a lot of the secret of our success  was our humility    was the tentative nature of our engagement. We criticized people a lot in Bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals. We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees. But that slowness  that caution  the fact that President Clinton initially said that American troops would only be deployed for a year  turned out to be a strength  and it helped us to put our priorities right. One of the saddest things about our involvement in Afghanistan is that we've got our priorities out of sync. We're not matching our resources to our priorities. Because if what we're interested in is terrorism  Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan. If what we're interested in is regional stability  Egypt is far more important. If what we're worried about is poverty and development  sub Saharan Africa is far more important. This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter  but that it's one of    countries in the world with which we need to engage. So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention  what we need to think of is something like mountain rescue. Why mountain rescue  Because when people talk about intervention  they imagine that some scientific theory    the Rand Corporation goes around counting    previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter insurgent for every    members of the population. This is the wrong way of looking at it. You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue. When you're doing mountain rescue  you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue  you look for somebody who knows the terrain. It's about context. You understand that you can prepare  but the amount of preparation you can do is limited    you can take some water  you can have a map  you can have a pack. But what really matters is two kinds of problems    problems that occur on the mountain which you couldn't anticipate  such as  for example  ice on a slope  but which you can get around  and problems which you couldn't anticipate and which you can't get around  like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather. And the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain  in every temperature  at every period    a guide who  above all  knows when to turn back  who doesn't press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them. What we look for in firemen  in climbers  in policemen  and what we should look for in intervention  is intelligent risk takers    not people who plunge blind off a cliff  not people who jump into a burning room  but who weigh their risks  weigh their responsibilities. Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option. It makes failure invisible  inconceivable and inevitable. And if we can resist this crazy slogan  we shall discover    in Egypt  in Syria  in Libya  and anywhere else we go in the world    that if we can often do much less than we pretend  we can do much more than we fear. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Rory  you mentioned Libya at the end. Just briefly  what's your take on the current events there and the intervention  Rory Stewart  Okay  I think Libya poses the classic problem. The problem in Libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white. We imagine there are only two choices  either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation. And we are always being tempted up to our neck. We put our toes in and we go up to our neck. What we should have done in Libya is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution. We should have limited ourselves very  very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi. We could have done that. We set up a no fly zone within    hours because Gaddafi had no planes within    hours. Instead of which  we've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change. In doing so  we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council  which means it's very difficult to get a resolution on Syria  and we're setting ourselves up again for failure. Once more  humility  limits  honesty  realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of. BG  Rory  thank you very much. RS  Thank you.  BG  Thank you.  Cities are the crucible of civilization. They have been expanding  urbanization has been expanding  at an exponential rate in the last     years so that by the second part of this century  the planet will be completely dominated by cities. Cities are the origins of global warming  impact on the environment  health  pollution  disease  finance  economies  energy    they're all problems that are confronted by having cities. That's where all these problems come from. And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet. Here's some numbers. Two hundred years ago  the United States was less than a few percent urbanized. It's now more than    percent. The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago. China's building     new cities in the next    years. Now listen to this  Every week for the foreseeable future  until       every week more than a million people are being added to our cities. This is going to affect everything. Everybody in this room  if you stay alive  is going to be affected by what's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon. However  cities  despite having this negative aspect to them  are also the solution. Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people  creating ideas  innovation  wealth and so on. So we have this kind of dual nature. And so there's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities. Now these are my comrades in arms. This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people  and they've done all the work  and I'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together. So here's the problem  This is what we all want. The    billion people on the planet in      want to live in places like this  having things like this  doing things like this  with economies that are growing like this  not realizing that entropy produces things like this  this  this and this. And the question is  Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York are going to look like in       or is it going to be this  That's the question. I must say  many of the indicators look like this is what it's going to look like  but let's talk about it. So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities. And scientific theory means quantifiable    relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework. That's the quest. Is that conceivable  Are there universal laws  So here's two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem. The first is  Are cities part of biology  Is London a great big whale  Is Edinburgh a horse  Is Microsoft a great big anthill  What do we learn from that  We use them metaphorically    the DNA of a company  the metabolism of a city  and so on    is that just bullshit  metaphorical bullshit  or is there serious substance to it  And if that is the case  how come that it's very hard to kill a city  You could drop an atom bomb on a city  and    years later it's surviving. Very few cities fail. All companies die  all companies. And if you have a serious theory  you should be able to predict when Google is going to go bust. So is that just another version of this  Well we understand this very well. That is  you ask any generic question about this    how many trees of a given size  how many branches of a given size does a tree have  how many leaves  what is the energy flowing through each branch  what is the size of the canopy  what is its growth  what is its mortality  We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions. And the idea is can we do the same for this  So the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life  is that it is scalable  it works over an extraordinary range. This is just a tiny range actually  It's us mammals  we're one of these. The same principles  the same dynamics  the same organization is at work in all of these  including us  and it can scale over a range of     million in size. And that is one of the main reasons life is so resilient and robust    scalability. We're going to discuss that in a moment more. But you know  at a local level  you scale  everybody in this room is scaled. That's called growth. Here's how you grew. Rat  that's a rat    could have been you. We're all pretty much the same. And you see  you're very familiar with this. You grow very quickly and then you stop. And that line there is a prediction from the same theory  based on the same principles  that describes that forest. And here it is for the growth of a rat  and those points on there are data points. This is just the weight versus the age. And you see  it stops growing. Very  very good for biology    also one of the reasons for its great resilience. Very  very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm. This is what we believe. This is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us  particularly illustrated in that left hand corner  hockey sticks. This is a bunch of software companies    and what it is is their revenue versus their age    all zooming away  and everybody making millions and billions of dollars. Okay  so how do we understand this  So let's first talk about biology. This is explicitly showing you how things scale  and this is a truly remarkable graph. What is plotted here is metabolic rate    how much energy you need per day to stay alive    versus your weight  your mass  for all of us bunch of organisms. And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of     otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph. And what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line. Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe  there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this. It's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms  each subsystem  each cell type  each gene  has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history. And yet  despite all of that Darwinian evolution and natural selection  they've been constrained to lie on a line. Something else is going on. Before I talk about that  I've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve  this straight line. It's three quarters  roughly  which is less than one    and we call that sublinear. And here's the point of that. It says that  if it were linear  the steepest slope  then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy. But it's sublinear  and what that translates into is that  if you double the size of the organism  you actually only need    percent more energy. So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale. The bigger you are systematically  according to very well defined rules  less energy per capita. Now any physiological variable you can think of  any life history event you can think of  if you plot it this way  looks like this. There is an extraordinary regularity. So you tell me the size of a mammal  I can tell you at the    percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology  life history  etc. And the reason for this is because of networks. All of life is controlled by networks    from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level. And you're very familiar with these networks. That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant. And here's the summary of what I'm saying. If you take those networks  this idea of networks  and you apply universal principles  mathematizable  universal principles  all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow  including the description of the forest  the description of your circulatory system  the description within cells. One of the things I did not stress in that introduction was that  systematically  the pace of life decreases as you get bigger. Heart rates are slower  you live longer  diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower  etc. The question is  Is any of this true for cities and companies  So is London a scaled up Birmingham  which is a scaled up Brighton  etc.  etc.  Is New York a scaled up San Francisco  which is a scaled up Santa Fe  Don't know. We will discuss that. But they are networks  and the most important network of cities is you. Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions  our interactions  and the clustering and grouping of individuals. Here's just a symbolic picture of that. And here's scaling of cities. This shows that in this very simple example  which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size    plotted in the same way as the biology    you see exactly the same kind of thing. There is a scaling. That is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size. The slope of that is less than linear. There is an economy of scale. Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are    not surprising. But here's what's surprising. It scales in the same way everywhere. This is just European countries  but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia  always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree. And any infrastructure you look at    whether it's the length of roads  length of electrical lines    anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way. It's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on. But even more surprising is if you look at socio economic quantities  quantities that have no analog in biology  that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to        years ago. The top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way. And the bottom one is you lot    super creatives plotted in the same way. And what you see is a scaling phenomenon. But most important in this  the exponent  the analog to that three quarters for the metabolic rate  is bigger than one    it's about  .   to  . . Here it is  which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita  unlike biology    higher wages  more super creative people per capita as you get bigger  more patents per capita  more crime per capita. And we've looked at everything  more AIDS cases  flu  etc. And here  they're all plotted together. Just to show you what we plotted  here is income  GDP    GDP of the city    crime and patents all on one graph. And you can see  they all follow the same line. And here's the statement. If you double the size of a city from         to          from a million to two million     to    million  it doesn't matter  then systematically you get a    percent increase in wages  wealth  number of AIDS cases  number of police  anything you can think of. It goes up by    percent  and you have a    percent savings on the infrastructure. This  no doubt  is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities. Because they think that all those wonderful things    like creative people  wealth  income    is what attracts them  forgetting about the ugly and the bad. What is the reason for this  Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics  but underlying this is the social networks  because this is a universal phenomenon. This    percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet    Japan  Chile  Portugal  Scotland  doesn't matter. Always  all the data shows it's the same  despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently. Something universal is going on. The universality  to repeat  is us    that we are the city. And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions. So there it is  I've said it again. So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure  unlike biology  which had sublinear scaling  economies of scale  you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger. If it's social networks with super linear scaling    more per capita    then the theory says that you increase the pace of life. The bigger you are  life gets faster. On the left is the heart rate showing biology. On the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of European cities  showing that increase. Lastly  I want to talk about growth. This is what we had in biology  just to repeat. Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior. You grow fast and then stop    part of our resilience. That would be bad for economies and cities. And indeed  one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation  then indeed you get  from the same theory  a beautiful rising exponential curve    lovely. And in fact  if you compare it to data  it fits very well with the development of cities and economies. But it has a terrible catch  and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse. And it's destined to collapse for many reasons    kind of Malthusian reasons    that you run out of resources. And how do you avoid that  Well we've done it before. What we do is  as we grow and we approach the collapse  a major innovation takes place and we start over again  and we start over again as we approach the next one  and so on. So there's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse. The catch  however  to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster. So the image is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster  but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster. We have to accelerate on a continuous basis. And the question is  Can we  as socio economic beings  avoid a heart attack  So lastly  I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies. See companies  they scale. The top one  in fact  is Walmart on the right. It's the same plot. This happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees. We could use sales  anything you like. There it is  after some little fluctuations at the beginning  when companies are innovating  they scale beautifully. And we've looked at        companies in the United States  may I say. And I'm only showing you a little bit of this. What is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology  indicating that they're dominated  not by super linear innovation and ideas  they become dominated by economies of scale. In that interpretation  by bureaucracy and administration  and they do it beautifully  may I say. So if you tell me the size of some company  some small company  I could have predicted the size of Walmart. If it has this sublinear scaling  the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth. There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal. That's what we like  hockey sticks. But you notice  I've cheated  because I've only gone up to '  . Let's go up to     . That red line is from the theory. So if I'd have done this in       I could have predicted what Walmart would be now. And then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies. There they are. That's        companies. They all start looking like hockey sticks  they all bend over  and they all die like you and me. Thank you. I'm going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life. But I want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man. This is Hermann Goering. Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II  his designated successor. And like Hitler  Goering fancied himself a collector of art. He went through Europe  through World War II  stealing  extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection. And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer. Hitler had two of them  and he didn't have any. So he finally found an art dealer  a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren  who sold him a wonderful Vermeer for the cost of what would now be    million dollars. And it was his favorite artwork ever. World War II came to an end  and Goering was captured  tried at Nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death. Then the Allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him. And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam and arrested Van Meegeren. Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason  which is itself punishable by death. Six weeks into his prison sentence  van Meegeren confessed. But he didn't confess to treason. He said   I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi. I painted it myself  I'm a forger.  Now nobody believed him. And he said   I'll prove it. Bring me a canvas and some paint  and I will paint a Vermeer much better than I sold that disgusting Nazi. I also need alcohol and morphine  because it's the only way I can work.  So they brought him in. He painted a beautiful Vermeer. And then the charges of treason were dropped. He had a lesser charge of forgery  got a year sentence and died a hero to the Dutch people. There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren  but I want to turn now to Goering  who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg. Now Goering was  by all accounts  a terrible man. Even for a Nazi  he was a terrible man. His American interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath. But you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery. According to his biographer   He looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world.  And he killed himself soon afterwards. He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that. It looked the same  but it had a different origin  it was a different artwork. It wasn't just him who was in for a shock. Once van Meegeren was on trial  he couldn't stop talking. And he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists. In particular   The Supper at Emmaus  which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece  his best work    people would come  from  all over the world to see it    was actually a forgery. It was not that painting  but that painting. And when that was discovered  it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum. Why does this matter  I'm a psychologists    why do origins matter so much  Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from  Well there's an answer that many people would give. Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs  because we're focused on status. Among other things  if you want to show off how rich you are  how powerful you are  it's always better to own an original than a forgery because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries. I don't doubt that that plays some role  but what I want to convince you of today is that there's something else going on. I want to convince you that humans are  to some extent  natural born essentialists. What I mean by this is we don't just respond to things as we see them  or feel them  or hear them. Rather  our response is conditioned on our beliefs  about what they really are  what they came from  what they're made of  what their hidden nature is. I want to suggest that this is true  not just for how we think about things  but how we react to things. So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep    and that this isn't true just for higher level pleasures like art  but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences. So take food. Would you eat this  Well  a good answer is   It depends. What is it   Some of you would eat it if it's pork  but not beef. Some of you would eat it if it's beef  but not pork. Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human. Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu. That's not so surprising. But what's more interesting is how it tastes to you will depend critically on what you think you're eating. So one demonstration of this was done with young children. How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk  but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk    to think they taste better  It's simple  you tell them they're from McDonald's. They believe McDonald's food is tastier  and it leads them to experience it as tastier. How do you get adults to really enjoy wine  It's very simple  pour it from an expensive bottle. There are now dozens  perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff  it tastes better to you. This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist. They get people into a fMRI scanner  and while they're lying there  through a tube  they get to sip wine. In front of them on a screen is information about the wine. Everybody  of course  drinks exactly the same wine. But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff  parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree. It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable  you say you like it more  you really experience it in a different way. Or take sex. These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies. And if you simply show people these pictures  they'll say these are fairly attractive people. But how attractive you find them  how sexually or romantically moved you are by them  rests critically on who you think you're looking at. You probably think the picture on the left is male  the one on the right is female. If that belief turns out to be mistaken  it will make a difference. It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are. It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you're looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter  your mother or father. Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido. Maybe one of the most heartening findings from the psychology of pleasure is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance. If you like somebody  they look better to you. This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do. A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome. So Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion. Sufferers of Capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates. Now often  a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic. People have murdered those that they loved  believing that they were murdering an imposter. But there's at least one case where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending. This was recorded in     .  Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover.  But that was before she got Capgras syndrome. After she got it   She was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich  virile  handsome and aristocratic.  Of course  it was the same man  but she was seeing him in different ways. As a third example  consider consumer products. So one reason why you might like something is its utility. You can put shoes on your feet  you can play golf with golf clubs  and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you. But each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history. The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy and sold for three quarters of a million dollars at auction. The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars. And in fact  there's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people. The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all. According to an unconfirmed report  a Saudi millionaire offered    million dollars for this pair of shoes. They were the ones thrown at George Bush at an Iraqi press conference several years ago. Now this attraction to objects doesn't just work for celebrity objects. Each one of us  most people  have something in our life that's literally irreplaceable  in that it has value because of its history    maybe your wedding ring  maybe your child's baby shoes    so that if it was lost  you couldn't get it back. You could get something that looked like it or felt like it  but you couldn't get the same object back. With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck  we've looked to see what sort of factors  what sort of history  matters for the objects that people like. So in one of our experiments  we asked people to name a famous person who they adored  a living person they adored. So one answer was George Clooney. Then we asked them   How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater   And the answer is a fair amount    more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore. Then we asked other groups of subjects    we gave them different restrictions and different conditions. So for instance  we told some people   Look  you can buy the sweater  but you can't tell anybody you own it  and you can't resell it.  That drops the value of it  suggesting that that's one reason why we like it. But what really causes an effect is you tell people   Look  you could resell it  you could boast about it  but before it gets to you  it's thoroughly washed.  That causes a huge drop in the value. As my wife put it   You've washed away the Clooney cooties.  So let's go back to art. I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall. If people want to get me something at the end of the conference  you could buy me a Chagall. But I don't want a duplicate  even if I can't tell the difference. That's not because  or it's not simply because  I'm a snob and want to boast about having an original. Rather  it's because I want something that has a specific history. In the case of artwork  the history is special indeed. The philosopher Denis Dutton in his wonderful book  The Art Instinct  makes the case that   The value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation.  And that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery. They may look alike  but they have a different history. The original is typically the product of a creative act  the forgery isn't. I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art. This is a work by Jackson Pollock. Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock  Okay. Who here  it does nothing for them  They just don't like it. I'm not going to make a claim about who's right  but I will make an empirical claim about people's intuitions  which is that  if you like the work of Jackson Pollock  you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it to believe that these works are difficult to create  that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy. I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example because there's a young American artist who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock  and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars    in large part because she's a very young artist. This is Marla Olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old. The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program    Minutes II into their house to film her painting. And they then reported that her father was coaching her. When this came out on television  the value of her art dropped to nothing. It was the same art  physically  but the history had changed. I've been focusing now on the visual arts  but I want to give two examples from music. This is Joshua Bell  a very famous violinist. And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment. The question is  How much would people like Joshua Bell  the music of Joshua Bell  if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell  So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington D.C. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make. And here's a brief clip of this. After being there for three quarters of an hour  he made    dollars. Not bad. It's also not good. Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell  you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell. He actually made    dollars more than that  but he didn't count it. Because this woman comes up    you see at the end of the video    she comes up. She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before at this extravagant black tie affair. So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station. So she's struck with pity. She reaches into her purse and hands him a   . The second example from music is from John Cage's modernist composition    '   .  As many of you know  this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench  opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and    seconds    that period of silence. And people have different views on this. But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes. For a dollar     you can listen to that silence  which is different than other forms of silence. Now I've been talking so far about pleasure  but what I want to suggest is that everything I've said applies as well to pain. And how you think about what you're experiencing  your beliefs about the essence of it  affect how it hurts. One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner. What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates to an electric shock machine. And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks. So it was a series of five painful shocks. Half of them are told that they're being given the shocks by somebody in another room  but the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks. There's no malevolence  they're just pressing a button. The first shock is recorded as very painful. The second shock feels less painful  because you get a bit used to it. The third drops  the fourth  the fifth. The pain gets less. In the other condition  they're told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose    knows they're shocking them. The first shock hurts like hell. The second shock hurts just as much  and the third and the fourth and the fifth. It hurts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose. The most extreme example of this is that in some cases  pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure. Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property that will often seek out low level doses of pain in controlled circumstances and take pleasure from it    as in the eating of hot chili peppers and roller coaster rides. The point was nicely summarized by the poet John Milton who wrote   The mind is its own place  and in itself can make a heaven of hell  a hell of heaven.  And I'll end with that. Thank you. Well after many years working in trade and economics  four years ago  I found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability. And I found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can't even obtain a meal. This red cup comes from Rwanda from a child named Fabian. And I carry this around as a symbol  really  of the challenge and also the hope. Because one cup of food a day changes Fabian's life completely. But what I'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning  about a billion people on Earth    or one out of every seven    woke up and didn't even know how to fill this cup. One out of every seven people. First  I'll ask you  Why should you care  Why should we care  For most people  if they think about hunger  they don't have to go far back on their own family history    maybe in their own lives  or their parents' lives  or their grandparents' lives    to remember an experience of hunger. I rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience. Some are driven by compassion  feel it's perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity. As Gandhi said   To a hungry man  a piece of bread is the face of God.  Others worry about peace and security  stability in the world. We saw the food riots in       after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight. The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history. One of the most fundamental acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food. Others think about Malthusian nightmares. Will we be able to feed a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades  This is not a negotiable thing  hunger. People have to eat. There's going to be a lot of people. This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain. But I actually came to this issue in a different way. This is a picture of me and my three children. In       I was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came on the television. And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia. One two years earlier had killed more than a million people. But it never struck me as it did that moment  because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby  and she had no milk to nurse. And the baby's cry really penetrated me  as a mother. And I thought  there's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned with food    the most fundamental expectation of every human being. And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem. This isn't one of those rare diseases that we don't have the solution for. We know how to fix hunger. A hundred years ago  we didn't. We actually have the technology and systems. And I was just struck that this is out of place. At our time in history  these images are out of place. Well guess what  This is last week in northern Kenya. Yet again  the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day. In fact  what we know now is that every    seconds we lose a child to hunger. This is more than HIV AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis combined. And we know that the issue is not just production of food. One of my mentors in life was Norman Borlaug  my hero. But today I'm going to talk about access to food  because actually this year and last year and during the      food crisis  there was enough food on Earth for everyone to have       kilocalories. So why is it that we have a billion people who can't find food  And I also want to talk about what I call our new burden of knowledge. In       Lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days    from conception to two years old    does not have adequate nutrition  the damage is irreversible. Their brains and bodies will be stunted. And here you see a brain scan of two children    one who had adequate nutrition  another  neglected and who was deeply malnourished. And we can see brain volumes up to    percent less in these children. And in this slide you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain don't form. And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies  which I'll talk about later. But also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years. So this burden of knowledge drives me. Because actually we know how to fix it very simply. And yet  in many places  a third of the children  by the time they're three already are facing a life of hardship due to this. I'd like to talk about some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger  some of the things I've learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector. I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is. Well first  I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth  breastfeeding. You may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every    seconds if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life. But in Niger  for example  less than seven percent of the children are breastfed for the first six months of life  exclusively. In Mauritania  less than three percent. This is something that can be transformed with knowledge. This message  this word  can come out that this is not an old fashioned way of doing business  it's a brilliant way of saving your child's life. And so today we focus on not just passing out food  but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment  and teaching them about breastfeeding. The second thing I'd like to talk about  If you were living in a remote village somewhere  your child was limp  and you were in a drought  or you were in floods  or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet  what would you do  Do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars  like we can  and pick the right one to match  Well I find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count. And I go to those shops  if there are any  or out to the fields to see what they can get  and they cannot obtain the nutrition. Even if they know what they need to do  it's not available. And I'm very excited about this  because one thing we're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops. And this is made with chickpeas  dried milk and a host of vitamins  matched to exactly what the brain needs. It costs    cents for us to produce this as  what I call  food for humanity. We did this with food technologists in India and Pakistan    really about three of them. But this is transforming    percent of the kids who get this. One package     cents a day    their malnutrition is overcome. So I am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods. And this is climate proof. It doesn't need to be refrigerated  it doesn't need water  which is often lacking. And these types of technologies  I see  have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition  malnutrition out on the front lines. The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding. Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net. When disaster strikes    the economy gets blown  people lose a job  floods  war  conflict  bad governance  all of those things    there is nothing to fall back on. And usually the institutions    churches  temples  other things    do not have the resources to provide a safety net. What we have found working with the World Bank is that the poor man's safety net  the best investment  is school feeding. And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers  you have a transformative effect. Many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal. But when that food is there  it's transformative. It costs less than    cents a day to change a kid's life. But what is most amazing is the effect on girls. In countries where girls don't go to school and you offer a meal to girls in school  we see enrollment rates about    percent girls and boys. We see a transformation in attendance by girls. And there was no argument  because it's incentive. Families need the help. And we find that if we keep girls in school later  they'll stay in school until they're     and won't get married if there's food in school. Or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week    it costs about    cents    will keep a girl in school  and they'll give birth to a healthier child  because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation. We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger. We know this. Right now on the Horn of Africa  we've been through this before. So is this a hopeless cause  Absolutely not. I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope. Cameroon  northern Cameroon  boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades. Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons. Well two years ago  we decided  let's transform the model of fighting hunger  and instead of giving out the food aid  we put it into food banks. And we said  listen  during the lean season  take the food out. You manage  the village manages these warehouses. And during harvest  put it back with interest  food interest. So add in five percent     percent more food. For the past two years      of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid    they're self sufficient. And the food banks are growing. And they're starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village. But they've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources. I love this idea that came from the village level  three keys to unlock that warehouse. Food is gold there. And simple ideas can transform the face  not of small areas  of big areas of the world. I'd like to talk about what I call digital food. Technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine. Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize for saying   Guess what  famines happen in the presence of food because people have no ability to buy it.  We certainly saw that in     . We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up     percent in some areas over last year. Food can be there and people can't buy it. Well this picture    I was in Hebron in a small shop  this shop  where instead of bringing in food  we provide digital food  a card. It says  bon appetit  in Arabic. And the women can go in and swipe and get nine food items. They have to be nutritious  and they have to be locally produced. And what's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry    where this card's used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus    the dairy industry has gone up    percent. The shopkeepers are hiring more people. It is a win win win situation that starts the food economy moving. We now deliver food in over    countries over cell phones  transforming even the presence of refugees in countries  and other ways. Perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that Bill Gates  Howard Buffett and others have supported boldly  which is to ask the question  What if  instead of looking at the hungry as victims    and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families    what if we view them as the solution  as the value chain to fight hunger  What if from the women in Africa who cannot sell any food    there's no roads  there's no warehouses  there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with    what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere  And Purchasing for Progress today is in    countries. And guess what  In virtually every case  when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market    if you say   We will buy     metric tons of this. We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly.     their yields have gone up two   three   fourfold and they figure it out  because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life. And we're seeing people transform their lives. Today  food aid  our food aid    huge engine       percent of it is bought in the developing world. Total transformation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food. Now you'd ask  can this be done at scale  These are great ideas  village level ideas. Well I'd like to talk about Brazil  because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years  when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now. And what I've found is  rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things  they invested in a school feeding program. And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity. And they're doing this at huge scale after President Lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day. And this zero hunger program costs .  percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty. It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil  and it's at scale  and it's creating opportunities. I've gone out there  I've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this. Now if we look at the economic imperative here  this isn't just about compassion. The fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger    the cost to society  the burden it has to bear    is on average six percent  and in some countries up to    percent  of GDP a year. And if you look at the    countries with the highest burden of malnutrition  that's     billion lost from a productive economy every year. Well  the World Bank estimates it would take about    billion dollars      .     to address malnutrition in those countries. You look at the cost benefit analysis  and my dream is to take this issue  not just from the compassion argument  but to the finance ministers of the world  and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate  affordable nutrition for all of humanity. The amazing thing I've found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader. When a leader says   Not under my watch   everything begins to change. And the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this. And the fact that France has put food at the center of the G   is really important. Because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person  nation by nation. We have to stand together. And we're seeing nations in Africa. WFP's been able to leave    nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations. What I would like to offer here is a challenge. I believe we're living at a time in human history where it's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don't know where to find a cup of food. Not only that  transforming hunger is an opportunity  but I think we have to change our mindsets. I am so honored to be here with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers. And I would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say   No more. No more are we going to accept this.  And we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted  but that exists no more. Thank you. We are losing our listening. We spend roughly    percent of our communication time listening  but we're not very good at it. We retain just    percent of what we hear. Now not you  not this talk  but that is generally true. Let's define listening as making meaning from sound. It's a mental process  and it's a process of extraction. We use some pretty cool techniques to do this. One of them is pattern recognition. if I say   David  Sara  pay attention   some of you just sat up. We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal  and especially our name. Differencing is another technique we use. If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes  you would literally cease to hear it. We listen to differences  we discount sounds that remain the same. And then there is a whole range of filters. These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to. Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters. But they actually create our reality in a way  because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now. Give you one example of that  Intention is very important in sound  in listening. When I married my wife  I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time. Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis. But it's a great intention to have in a relationship. But that's not all. Sound places us in space and in time. If you close your eyes right now in this room  you're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces. And you're aware of how many people are around you because of the micro noises you're receiving. And sound places us in time as well  because sound always has time embedded in it. In fact  I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future. So   Sonority is time and meaning     a great quote. I said at the beginning  we're losing our listening. Why did I say that  Well there are a lot of reasons for this. First of all  we invented ways of recording    first writing  then audio recording and now video recording as well. The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared. Secondly  the world is now so noisy  visually and auditorily  it's just hard to listen  it's tiring to listen. Many people take refuge in headphones  but they turn big  public spaces like this  shared soundscapes  into millions of tiny  little personal sound bubbles. In this scenario  nobody's listening to anybody. We're becoming impatient. We don't want oratory anymore  we want sound bites. And the art of conversation is being replaced    dangerously  I think    by personal broadcasting. I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation  which is sadly very common  especially in the U.K. We're becoming desensitized. Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention. And that means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet  the subtle  the understated. This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening. This is not trivial. Because listening is our access to understanding. Conscious listening always creates understanding. And only without conscious listening can these things happen    a world where we don't listen to each other at all  is a very scary place indeed. So I'd like to share with you five simple exercises  tools you can take away with you  to improve your own conscious listening. Would you like that  The first one is silence. Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again. If you can't get absolute silence  go for quiet  that's absolutely fine. Second  I call this the mixer. and we all spend a lot of time in places like this    listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear  How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to  You can do it in a beautiful place as well  like in a lake. How many birds am I hearing  Where are they  Where are those ripples  It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening. Third  this exercise I call savoring  and this is a beautiful exercise. It's about enjoying mundane sounds. This  for example  is my tumble dryer. One  two  three. One  two  three. One  two  three. I love it. Or just try this one on for size. Wow  So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention. I call that the hidden choir. It's around us all the time. The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these  if you just take one thing away. This is listening positions    the idea that you can move your listening position to what's appropriate to what you're listening to. This is playing with those filters. Do you remember  I gave you those filters at the beginning. It's starting to play with them as levers  to get conscious about them and to move to different places. These are just some of the listening positions  or scales of listening positions  that you can use. There are many. Have fun with that. It's very exciting. And finally  an acronym. You can use this in listening  in communication. If you're in any one of those roles    and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk    the acronym is RASA  which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence. And RASA stands for Receive  which means pay attention to the person  Appreciate  making little noises like  hmm    oh    okay   Summarize  the word  so  is very important in communication  and Ask  ask questions afterward. Now sound is my passion  it's my life. I wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen. That's too much to ask from most people. But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully    connected in space and in time to the physical world around us  connected in understanding to each other  not to mention spiritually connected  because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart. That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill. Why is it not taught  It's crazy. And if we can teach listening in our schools  we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous  scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time    or at least capable of doing it. Now I don't know how to do that  but this is TED  and I think the TED community is capable of anything. So I invite you to connect with me  connect with each other  take this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools  and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world    a world of connection  a world of understanding and a world of peace. Thank you for listening to me today. By the end of this year  there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites. The one thing that all of them have in common is that they're going to die. While that might be a somewhat morbid thought  I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring. What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller  who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer. And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died. Here's what he wrote in starting that out. He said   Here it is. I'm dead  and this is my last post to my blog. In advance  I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer  then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote    the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive.  Now  while as a journalist  Miller's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most  the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than anything that's been created by any previous generation. Consider a few stats for a moment. Right now there are    hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute. There are     million Tweets being posted every day. And the average Facebook user is creating    pieces of content each month. So when you think about your parents or your grandparents  at best they may have created some photos or home videos  or a diary that lives in a box somewhere. But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely  years after we're gone. And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists. Now to be clear  I'm a journalist and not a technologist  so what I'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like. Now we're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die. One of them actually  fittingly enough  found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare. Death  Adam  AO  Yeah. Death  Death can catch you anywhere  anytime  even at the Organic. AO  Who is this  Death  Go to ifidie.net before it's too late. Adam Ostrow  Kind of creepy  right  So what that service does  quite simply  is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die. Another service right now is called       Memories. And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones  complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die. But what I think comes next is far more interesting. Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who  back in March  demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than        hours of home video. I think as machines' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve  it's going to become possible to analyze an entire life's worth of content    the Tweets  the photos  the videos  the blog posts    that we're producing in such massive numbers. And I think as that happens  it's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating and technology's ability to make sense of it all. Now we're already starting to see some experiments here. One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream  everything you've posted onto Twitter  to make some predictions as to what you might say next. Well right now  as you can see  the results can be somewhat comical. You can imagine what something like this might look like five     or    years from now as our technical capabilities improve. Taking it a step further  MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans. But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime  Finally  think back to this famous scene from election night      back in the United States  where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper. What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms    interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive  I think that's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we're producing and technology's ability to understand it both expand exponentially. Now in closing  I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality    and if so  what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it. Thank you very much. Do you know that we have  .  million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide  And these are base stations. And we also have more than five billion of these devices here. These are cellular mobile phones. And with these mobile phones  we transmit more than     terabytes of data every month. This is a   with    zeroes    a very large number. And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water. We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now    in our private lives  in our business lives. And we even have to be asked sometimes  very kindly  to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons. And it's this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has  because it's so fundamental to our lives. And one of the issues is capacity. The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves    in particular  radio waves. And radio waves are limited. They are scarce  they are expensive  and we only have a certain range of it. And it's this limitation that doesn't cope with the demand of wireless data transmissions and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month. And we are simply running out of spectrum. There's another problem. That is efficiency. These  .  million cellular radio masts  or base stations  consume a lot of energy. And mind you  most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves  it is used to cool the base stations. Then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent. And that creates a big problem. Then there's another issue that you're all aware of. You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights. In hospitals  they are security issues. And security is another issue. These radio waves penetrate through walls. They can be intercepted  and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad intentions. So these are the main four issues. But on the other hand  we have    billion of these  light bulbs  light. And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. So let's look at this in the context of the entire electromagnetic spectrum  where we have gamma rays. You don't want to get close to gamma rays  it could be dangerous. X rays  useful when you go to hospitals. Then there's ultraviolet light. it's good for a nice suntan  but otherwise dangerous for the human body. Infrared    due to eye safety regulations  can be only used with low power. And then we have the radio waves  they have the issues I've just mentioned. And in the middle there  we have this visible light spectrum. It's light  and light has been around for many millions of years. And in fact  it has created us  has created life  has created all the stuff of life. So it's inherently safe to use. And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications  Not only that  I compared  it to  the entire spectrum. I compared the radio waves spectrum    the size of it    with the size of the visible light spectrum. And guess what  We have        times more of that spectrum  which is there for us to use. So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum  let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned. We have  .  million expensively deployed  inefficient radio cellular base stations. And multiply that by         then you end up at    billion.    billion is the number of light bulbs installed already. So we have the infrastructure there. Look at the ceiling  you see all these light bulbs. Go to the main floor  you see these light bulbs. Can we use them for communications  Yes. What do we need to do  The one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs  florescent lights  with this new technology of LED  LED light bulbs. An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device. And it has a very nice acute property. Its intensity can be modulated at very high speeds  and it can be switched off at very high speeds. And this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology. So let's show how we do that. Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum    go to remote controls. You all know remote controls have an infrared LED    basically you switch on the LED  and if it's off  you switch it off. And it creates a simple  low speed data stream in        bits per second         bits per second. Not usable for a YouTube video. What we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb. We transmit with our technology  not only a single data stream  we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel  at even higher speeds. And the technology we have developed    it's called SIM OFDM. And it's spacial modulation    these are the only technical terms  I'm not going into details    but this is how we enabled that light source to transmit data. You will say   Okay  this is nice    a slide created in    minutes.  But not only that. What we've done is we have also developed a demonstrator. And I'm showing for the first time in public this visible light demonstrator. And what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp. We fit in an LED light bulb  worth three U.S. dollars  put in our signal processing technology. And then what we have here is a little hole. And the light goes through that hole. There's a receiver. The receiver will convert these little  subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal. And that signal is then converted back to a high speed data stream. In the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones. And not only integrate a photo detector here  but maybe use the camera inside. So what happens when I switch on that light  As you would expect  it's a light  a desk lamp. Put your book beneath it and you can read. It's illuminating the space. But at the same time  you see this video coming up here. And that's a video  a high definition video that is transmitted through that light beam. You're critical. You think   Ha  ha  ha. This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here.  But let me do this. Once again. Still don't believe  It is this light that transmits this high definition video in a split stream. And if you look at the light  it is illuminating as you would expect. You don't notice with your human eye. You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb. It's serving the purpose of illumination  but at the same time  we are able to transmit this data. And you see  even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver. It can ignore that constant light  because all the receiver's interested in are subtle changes. You also have a critical question now  and you say   Okay  do I have to have the light on all the time to have this working   And the answer is yes. But  you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off. And you are still able to transmit data    that's possible. So I've mentioned to you the four challenges. Capacity  We have        times more spectrum         times more LEDs installed already in the infrastructure there. You would agree with me  hopefully  there's no issue of capacity anymore. Efficiency  This is data through illumination    it's first of all an illumination device. And if you do the energy budget  the data transmission comes for free    highly energy efficient. I don't mention the high energy efficiency of these LED light bulbs. If the whole world would deploy them  you would save hundreds of power plants. That's aside. And then I've mentioned the availability. You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital. You need to see what to do. You have lights in an aircraft. So it's everywhere in a day there is light. Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone. It has a flashlight  an LED flashlight. These are potential sources for high speed data transmission. And then there's security. You would agree with me that light doesn't penetrate through walls. So no one  if I have a light here  if I have secure data  no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data. And there's only data where there is light. So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data  then what I could do  turn it away. So the data goes in that direction  not there anymore. Now we can in fact see where the data is going to. So for me  the applications of it  to me  are beyond imagination at the moment. We have had a century of very nice  smart application developers. And you only have to notice  where we have light  there is a potential way to transmit data. But I can give you a few examples. Well you may see the impact already now. This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean. And they use light to illuminate space down there. And this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things  use  to communicate with each other. Intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant    you can't use RF  it may generate antenna sparks  but you can use light    you see plenty of light there. In hospitals  for new medical instruments  in streets for traffic control. Cars have LED based headlights  LED based back lights  and cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents in the way that they exchange information. Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on. And then you have these millions of street lamps deployed around the world. And every street lamp could be a free access point. We call it  in fact  a Li Fi  light fidelity. And then we have these aircraft cabins. There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin  and each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data. So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video on your long flight back home. Online life. So that is a vision  I think  that is possible. So  all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device. And this would then combine two basic functionalities  illumination and wireless data transmission. And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe could solve the four essential problems that face us in wireless communication these days. And in the future  you would not only have    billion light bulbs  you may have    billion Li Fis deployed worldwide    for a cleaner  a greener  and even a brighter future. Thank you. Each of you possesses the most powerful  dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised. It's a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people's minds. I'm talking about your language  of course  because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind  and they can attempt to do the same to you  without either of you having to perform surgery. Instead  when you speak  you're actually using a form of telemetry not so different from the remote control device for your television. It's just that  whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light  your language relies on pulses  discrete pulses  of sound. And just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood  you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else's brain to suit your interests. Languages are genes talking  getting things that they want. And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that  merely by uttering a sound  it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic  and maybe even into its mouth. Now language's subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship  in books you can't read  phrases you can't use and words you can't say. In fact  the Tower of Babel story in the Bible is a fable and warning about the power of language. According to that story  early humans developed the conceit that  by using their language to work together  they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven. Now God  angered at this attempt to usurp his power  destroyed the tower  and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt  he scattered the people by giving them different languages    confused them by giving them different languages. And this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating. Even today  we know that there are words we cannot use  phrases we cannot say  because if we do so  we might be accosted  jailed  or even killed. And all of this from a puff of air emanating from our mouths. Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there's something worth explaining. And that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve  and why did it evolve only in our species  Now it's a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question  we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees. Now these chimpanzees are using tools  and we take that as a sign of their intelligence. But if they really were intelligent  why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground rather than a shovel  And if they really were intelligent  why would they crack open nuts with a rock  Why wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them  Why not  I mean  that's what we do. Now the reason the chimpanzees don't do that is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call social learning. They seem to lack the ability to learn from others by copying or imitating or simply watching. As a result  they can't improve on others' ideas or learn from others' mistakes    benefit from others' wisdom. And so they just do the same thing over and over and over again. In fact  we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same rocks to crack open the nuts. Now this may sound arrogant  or even full of hubris. How do we know this  Because this is exactly what our ancestors  the Homo erectus  did. These upright apes evolved on the African savanna about two million years ago  and they made these splendid hand axes that fit wonderfully into your hands. But if we look at the fossil record  we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years. You can follow it through the fossil record. Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived  what their generation time was  that's about        generations of parents to offspring  and other individuals watching  in which that hand axe didn't change. It's not even clear that our very close genetic relatives  the Neanderthals  had social learning. Sure enough  their tools were more complicated than those of Homo erectus  but they too showed very little change over the         years or so that those species  the Neanderthals  lived in Eurasia. Okay  so what this tells us is that  contrary to the old adage   monkey see  monkey do   the surprise really is that all of the other animals really cannot do that    at least not very much. And even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it    something from a Barnum   Bailey circus. But by comparison  we can learn. We can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do. We can then choose  from among a range of options  the best one. We can benefit from others' ideas. We can build on their wisdom. And as a result  our ideas do accumulate  and our technology progresses. And this cumulative cultural adaptation  as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas  is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives. I mean the world has changed out of all proportion to what we would recognize even       or       years ago. And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation. The chairs you're sitting in  the lights in this auditorium  my microphone  the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you    all are a result of cumulative cultural adaptation. Now to many commentators  cumulative cultural adaptation  or social learning  is job done  end of story. Our species can make stuff  therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has. In fact  we can even make the  stuff of life     as I just said  all the stuff around us. But in fact  it turns out that some time around         years ago  when our species first arose and acquired social learning  that this was really the beginning of our story  not the end of our story. Because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma  the resolution of which  it's fair to say  would determine not only the future course of our psychology  but the future course of the entire world. And most importantly for this  it'll tell us why we have language. And the reason that dilemma arose is  it turns out  that social learning is visual theft. If I can learn by watching you  I can steal your best ideas  and I can benefit from your efforts  without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them. If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish  or I can watch how you flake your hand axe to make it better  or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch  I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills  and maybe even catch that fish before you do. Social learning really is visual theft. And in any species that acquired it  it would behoove you to hide your best ideas  lest somebody steal them from you. And so some time around         years ago  our species confronted this crisis. And we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring. One of those options was that we could have retreated into small family groups. Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge would flow just to our relatives. Had we chosen this option  sometime around         years ago  we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were when we first entered Europe        years ago. And this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas  there are fewer innovations. And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck. So if we'd chosen that path  our evolutionary path would have led into the forest    and been a short one indeed. The other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others. Choosing this option would mean that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom would become available to any one individual than would ever arise from within an individual family or an individual person on their own. Well  we chose the second option  and language is the result. Language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft. Language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation    for reaching agreements  for striking deals and for coordinating our activities. And you can see that  in a developing society that was beginning to acquire language  not having language would be a like a bird without wings. Just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit  language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit. And we take this utterly for granted  because we're a species that is so at home with language  but you have to realize that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in are utterly dependent upon language. And to see why  consider two scenarios from early in our evolution. Let's imagine that you are really good at making arrowheads  but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached. Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts  but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads. So what you do is    one of those people has not really acquired language yet. And let's pretend the other one is good at language skills. So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads  and you walk up to the one that can't speak very well  and you put the arrowheads down in front of him  hoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows. But he looks at the pile of arrowheads  thinks they're a gift  picks them up  smiles and walks off. Now you pursue this guy  gesticulating. A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed with one of your own arrowheads. Okay  now replay this scene now  and you're approaching the one who has language. You put down your arrowheads and say   I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you      .  The other one says   Fine. Looks good to me. We'll do that.  Now the job is done. Once we have language  we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we couldn't have before we acquired it. And this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoos  languishing. That's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract termites. All right  if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true  any species that acquires it should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity. And this is exactly what the archeological record shows. If you look at our ancestors  the Neanderthals and the Homo erectus  our immediate ancestors  they're confined to small regions of the world. But when our species arose about         years ago  sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa and spread around the entire world  occupying nearly every habitat on Earth. Now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to  with social learning and language  we could transform the environment to suit our needs. And so we prospered in a way that no other animal has. Language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved. It is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised. Language really is the voice of our genes. Now having evolved language  though  we did something peculiar  even bizarre. As we spread out around the world  we developed thousands of different languages. Currently  there are about seven or       different languages spoken on Earth. Now you might say  well  this is just natural. As we diverge  our languages are naturally going to diverge. But the real puzzle and irony is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth is found where people are most tightly packed together. If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea  we can find about     to       distinct human languages  different human languages  spoken on that island alone. There are places on that island where you can encounter a new language every two or three miles. Now  incredible as this sounds  I once met a Papuan man  and I asked him if this could possibly be true. And he said to me   Oh no. They're far closer together than that.  And it's true  there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language in under a mile. And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands. And so it seems that we use our language  not just to cooperate  but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities  and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside. And we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures  we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups. They slow the flow of technologies. And they even slow the flow of genes. Now I can't speak for you  but it seems to be the case that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to. Now we have to counter that  though  against the evidence we've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans. Okay  this tendency we have  this seemingly natural tendency we have  towards isolation  towards keeping to ourselves  crashes head first into our modern world. This remarkable image is not a map of the world. In fact  it's a map of Facebook friendship links. And when you plot those friendship links by their latitude and longitude  it literally draws a map of the world. Our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past. And that communication  that connectivity around the world  that globalization now raises a burden. Because these different languages impose a barrier  as we've just seen  to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom. And they impose a barrier to cooperation. And nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the European Union  whose    member countries speak    official languages. The European Union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their    official languages. That's something on the order of  .   billion U.S. dollars on translation costs alone. Now think of the absurdity of this situation. If    individuals from those    member states sat around table  speaking their    languages  some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of     translators to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities. The European Union employs a permanent staff of about       translators. And in      alone    and I'm sure there are more recent figures    something on the order of  .  million pages were translated into English alone. And so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft  if language really is the conduit of our cooperation  the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas  in our modern world  we confront a question. And that question is whether in this modern  globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages. To put it this way  nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist. One of them always drives the other extinct. And we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization. There are lots and lots of ways of measuring things    weighing them and measuring their length    but the metric system is winning. There are lots and lots of ways of measuring time  but a really bizarre base    system known as hours and minutes and seconds is nearly universal around the world. There are many  many ways of imprinting CDs or DVDs  but those are all being standardized as well. And you can probably think of many  many more in your own everyday lives. And so our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma. And it's the dilemma that this Chinese man faces  who's language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language  and yet he is sitting at his blackboard  converting Chinese phrases into English language phrases. And what this does is it raises the possibility to us that in a world in which we want to promote cooperation and exchange  and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before on cooperation to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity  his actions suggest to us it might be inevitable that we have to confront the idea that our destiny is to be one world with one language. Thank you. Matt Ridley  Mark  one question. Svante found that the FOXP  gene  which seems to be associated with language  was also shared in the same form in Neanderthals as us. Do we have any idea how we could have defeated Neanderthals if they also had language  Mark Pagel  This is a very good question. So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP  that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that's associated with language. The reason why I don't believe that tells us that the Neanderthals had language is    here's a simple analogy  Ferraris are cars that have engines. My car has an engine  but it's not a Ferrari. Now the simple answer then is that genes alone don't  all by themselves  determine the outcome of very complicated things like language. What we know about this FOXP  and Neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths    who knows. But that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language. MR  Thank you very much indeed. Humans in the developed world spend more than    percent of their lives indoors  where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye  microorganisms. Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us  and some that are bad for us. What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors  Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems. And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures. The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans  and with the human built environment. And today  architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us. We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments  like this building here    environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering  heating and air conditioning. Given the amount of time that we spend indoors  it's important to understand how this affects our health. At the Biology and the Built Environment Center  we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air. And we looked at three different types of rooms. We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated  which are the data points in the blue. We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated  where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable  but they made them operable for our study. And we also sampled the outdoor air. If you look at the x axis of this graph  you'll see that what we commonly want to do    which is keeping the outdoors out    we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation. So if you look at the green data points  which is air that's outside  you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity  or variety of microbial types. But if you look at the blue data points  which is mechanically ventilated air  it's not as diverse. But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health. If you look at the y axis of this graph  you'll see that  in the mechanically ventilated air  you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen  or germ  than if you're outdoors. So to understand why this was the case  we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram  which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples. The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart. And the first things that you can see from this graph is  if you look at the blue data points  which are the mechanically ventilated air  they're not simply a subset of the green data points  which are the outdoor air. What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans. It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth  our spit. And this is because we're all constantly shedding microbes. So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another. And when you're outdoors  that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt. Why does this matter  It matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States. Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings. And the model that we're working with in hospitals  and also with many  many different buildings  is to keep the outdoors out. And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health. And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections  or hospital acquired infections  this is a clue that it's a good time to reconsider our current practices. So just as we manage national parks  where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others  we're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors. I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut. And for this reason  many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora. And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside. Thank you. So today  I want us to reflect on the demise of guys. Guys are flaming out academically  they're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women. Other than that  there's not much of a problem. So what's the data  So the data on dropping out is amazing. Boys are    percent more likely than girls to drop out of school. In Canada  five boys drop out for every three girls. Girls outperform boys now at every level  from elementary school to graduate school. There's a    percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate programs  with guys falling behind girls. Two thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys. And as you all know  boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder    and therefore we drug them with Ritalin. What's the evidence of wiping out  First  it's a new fear of intimacy. Intimacy means physical  emotional connection with somebody else    and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous  contradictory  phosphorescent signals. And every year there's research done on self reported shyness among college students. And we're seeing a steady increase among males. And this is two kinds. It's a social awkwardness. The old shyness was a fear of rejection. It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land. They don't know what to say  they don't know what to do  especially one on one  with the  opposite sex. They don't know the language of face contact  the non verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else  listen to somebody else. There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome  which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating. It turns out  from earliest childhood  boys  and then men  prefer the company of guys    physical company. And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at  because guys have been with guys in teams  in clubs  in gangs  in fraternities  especially in the military  and then in pubs. And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers  watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers  rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom. The problem is they now prefer  the  asynchronistic Internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships. What are the causes  Well  it's an unintended consequence. I think it's excessive Internet use in general  excessive video gaming  excessive new access to pornography. The problem is these are arousal addictions. Drug addiction  you simply want more. Arousal addiction  you want different. Drugs  you want more of the same    different. So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained. And the problem is the industry is supplying it. Jane McGonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is     he's played        hours of video games  most of that in isolation. As you remember  Cindy Gallop said men don't know the difference between making love and doing porn. The average boy now watches    porn video clips a week. And there's some guy watching a hundred  obviously. And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America       billion annually. For every     movies made in Hollywood  there are        now made porn videos. So the effect  very quickly  is it's a new kind of arousal. Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change  novelty  excitement and constant arousal. That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes  which are analog  static  interactively passive. They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships  which build gradually and subtly. So what's the solution  It's not my job. I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve. But who should care  The only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls  educators  gamers  filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to  who can dance  who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs. No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you. For a long time  there was me  and my body. Me was composed of stories  of cravings  of strivings  of desires of the future. Me was trying not to be an outcome of my violent past  but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome. Me was always trying to become something  somebody. Me only existed in the trying. My body was often in the way. Me was a floating head. For years  I actually only wore hats. It was a way of keeping my head attached. It was a way of locating myself. I worried that  if  I took my hat off I wouldn't be here anymore. I actually had a therapist who once said to me   Eve  you've been coming here for two years  and  to be honest  it never occurred to me that you had a body.  All this time I lived in the city because  to be honest  I was afraid of trees. I never had babies because heads cannot give birth. Babies actually don't come out of your mouth. As I had no reference point for my body  I began to ask other women about their bodies    in particular  their vaginas  because I thought vaginas were kind of important. This led to me writing  The Vagina Monologues   which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere I could. I did this in front of many strangers. One night on stage  I actually entered my vagina. It was an ecstatic experience. It scared me  it energized me  and then I became a driven person  a driven vagina. I began to see my body like a thing  a thing that could move fast  like a thing that could accomplish other things  many things  all at once. I began to see my body like an iPad or a car. I would drive it and demand things from it. It had no limits. It was invincible. It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself. I didn't heed it  no  I organized it and I directed it. I didn't have patience for my body  I snapped it into shape. I was greedy. I took more than my body had to offer. If I was tired  I drank more espressos. If I was afraid  I went to more dangerous places. Oh sure  sure  I had moments of appreciation of my body  the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness. My father was really kind to me on my   th birthday  for example. I heard people murmur from time to time that I should love my body  so I learned how to do this. I was a vegetarian  I was sober  I didn't smoke. But all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body    a further disassociation  like planting a vegetable field on a freeway. As a result of me talking so much about my vagina  many women started to tell me about theirs    their stories about their bodies. Actually  these stories compelled me around the world  and I've been to over    countries. I heard thousands of stories  and I have to tell you  there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body    when she left home. I heard about women being molested in their beds  flogged in their burqas  left for dead in parking lots  acid burned in their kitchens. Some women became quiet and disappeared. Other women became mad  driven machines like me. In the middle of my traveling  I turned    and I began to hate my body  which was actually progress  because at least my body existed enough to hate it. Well my stomach    it was my stomach I hated. It was proof that I had not measured up  that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape. My stomach was proof that I had failed  that it had failed me  that it was broken. My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it. In fact  it became so extreme I wrote a play about it. But the more I talked about it  the more objectified and fragmented my body became. It became entertainment  it became a new kind of commodity  something I was selling. Then I went somewhere else. I went outside what I thought I knew. I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo. And I heard stories that shattered all the other stories. I heard stories that got inside my body. I heard about a little girl who couldn't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her. I heard an    year old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that. There are thousands of these stories  and many of the women had holes in their bodies    holes  fistula    that were the violation of war    holes in the fabric of their souls. These stories saturated my cells and nerves  and to be honest  I stopped sleeping for three years. All the stories began to bleed together. The raping of the Earth  the pillaging of minerals  the destruction of vaginas    none of these were separate anymore from each other or me. Militias were raping six month old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers. My body had not only become a driven machine  but it was responsible now for destroying other women's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine. Then I got cancer    or I found out I had cancer. It arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane. Suddenly  I had a body  a body that was pricked and poked and punctured  a body that was cut wide open  a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed  a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it  a body that was burning from chemicals. Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection. I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world  and it wasn't happening later  it was happening now. Suddenly  my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere  the cancer of cruelty  the cancer of greed  the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical plants    and they're usually poor    the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs  the cancer of stress for not achieving enough  the cancer of buried trauma  the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish  the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped  the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness. In his new and visionary book   New Self  New World   the writer Philip Shepherd says   If you are divided from your body  you are also divided from the body of the world  which then appears to be other than you or separate from you  rather than the living continuum to which you belong.  Before cancer  the world was something other. It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea. Now I am swimming in it. Now I lay down in the grass and I rub my body in it  and I love the mud on my legs and feet. Now I make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine  and I hunger for the green fields in the bush outside Bukavu. And when it rains hard rain  I scream and I run in circles. I know that everything is connected  and the scar that runs the length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake. And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port au Prince. And the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world. I know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation  the    ounces of puss  is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico  and there were oil drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish. And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling. In my second chemo  my mother got very sick and I went to see her. And in the name of connectedness  the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico. So we brought her home  and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died. And gratefully  it didn't. And she died quietly in her favorite place. And a few weeks later  I was in New Orleans  and this beautiful  spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me. And I was honored. And I went to her house  and it was morning  and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains. And my friend was preparing this big bowl  and I said   What is it   And she said   It's for you. The flowers make it beautiful  and the honey makes it sweet.  And I said   But what's the water part   And in the name of connectedness  she said   Oh  it's the Gulf of Mexico.  And I said   Of course it is.  And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle  and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water. And she sang    I mean her whole body sang. And the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother. And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head  I realized that it held the best and the worst of us. It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion. It was all the lies that got told before and after. It was the honey in the water that made it sweet  it was the oil that made it sick. It was my head that was bald    and comfortable now without a hat. It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap. It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf that were falling down my cheek. It was finally being in my body. It was the sorrow that's taken so long. It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection. It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world. It was the Congolese women who are now rising up. It was my mother leaving  just at the moment that I was being born. It was the realization that I had come very close to dying    in the same way that the Earth  our mother  is barely holding on  in the same way that    percent of the planet are hardly scraping by  in the same way that there is a recipe for survival. What I learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves. It was advocating friends and a doting sister. It was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands. It was underpaid and really loving nurses. It was magic healers and aromatic oils. It was people who came with spells and rituals. It was having a vision of the future and something to fight for  because I know this struggle isn't my own. It was a million prayers. It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms. It was a lot of anger  insane humor  a lot of attention  outrage. It was energy  love and joy. It was all these things. It was all these things. It was all these things in the water  in the world  in my body. Climate change is already a heavy topic  and it's getting heavier because we're understanding that we need to do more than we are. We're understanding  in fact  that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions. That's  to put it mildly  not what's on the table now. And it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face. And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us  we tend to seek simple answers. And I think this is what we've done with climate change. We look at where the emissions are coming from    they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth  and we say  okay  well the problem is that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning  so therefore  the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy. And while  of course  we do need clean energy  I would put to you that it's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem  we're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it. And the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing. That shouldn't be news to any of us. However  it's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization. By mid century  we're going to have about eight billion    perhaps more    people living in cities or within a day's travel of one. We will be an overwhelmingly urban species. In order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global North live in today  we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy. It may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy. So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet  we need to look somewhere else for the solution. The solution  in fact  may be closer to hand than we think  because all of those cities we're building are opportunities. Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants. We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing    I choose to turn this light switch on    but really  enormous amounts of our energy use are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in. I won't show you very many graphs today  but if I can just focus on this one for a moment  it really tells us a lot of what we need to know    which is  quite simply  that if you look  for example  at transportation  a major category of climate emissions  there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air. And the correlation  of course  is that denser places tend to have lower emissions    which isn't really all that difficult to figure out  if you think about it. Basically  we substitute  in our lives  access to the things we want. We go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place. And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need. But when we live in a denser community  suddenly what we find  of course  is that the things we need are close by. And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place  suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable. And it is possible  of course  to increase the density of the communities around us. Some places are doing this with new eco districts  developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods  which is nice work if you can get it  but most of the time  what we're talking about is  in fact  reweaving the urban fabric that we already have. So we're talking about things like infill development  really sharp little changes to where we have buildings  where we're developing. Urban retrofitting  creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there. Increasingly  we're realizing that we don't even need to densify an entire city. What we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don't drive as much and so on. And that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot. So you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city. And we find that when we do that  we can  in fact  have a few places that are really hyper dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results. Now we may find that there are places that are really  really dense and still hold onto their cars  but the reality is that  by and large  what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect  where people simply stop driving as much  and increasingly  more and more people  if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home  give up their cars altogether. And this is a huge  huge energy savings  because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars. We have the manufacture of the car  the disposal of the car  all of the parking and freeways and so on. When you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn't use any of them really  you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as    percent. And people are embracing this. All around the world  we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life. People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood. And when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see  what you find is  in fact  even more access suffused into spaces. Some of it's transportation access. This is a Mapnificent map that shows me  in this case  how far I can get from my home in    minutes using public transportation. Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet. This is Google Walking Maps. I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway  and it told me to go via Guernsey. It did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths  though. But the technologies are getting better  and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation. And as we just heard earlier  of course  we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects. Things that don't have any wiring in them at all  we're learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation. Part of what we're finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption  which is to get a bunch of stuff  is not  in fact  how we really live best in dense environments. What we're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things. My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill  a home power drill  Okay. I do too. The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and    minutes in its entire lifetime  depending on who you ask. And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time  use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit. Our cities  I would put to you  are stockpiles of these surplus capacities. And while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities    such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit    what we probably will find is that  in fact  turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them  is a far smarter way to go. And in fact  even space itself is turning into a service. We're finding that people can share the same spaces  do stuff with vacant space. Buildings are becoming bundles of services. So we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on    like heating  cooling etc.    and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on. So we light our buildings with daylight. We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine. In fact  when we use all these things  what we've found is that  in some cases  energy use in a building can drop as much as    percent. Which brings on another threshold effect I like to call furnace dumping  which is  quite simply  if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace  you save a whole bunch of money up front. These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives. Now when we look at being able to slash our product use  slash our transportation use  slash our building energy use  all of that is great  but it still leaves something behind. And if we're going to really  truly become sustainable cities  we need to think a little differently. This is one way to do it. This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are. And certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery. So we have visions like this. We have visions like this. We have visions like this. Now all of these are fine projects  but they really have missed an essential point  which is it's not about the leaves above  it's about the systems below. Do they  for instance  capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use  Water is energy intensive. Do they  perhaps  include green infrastructure  so that we can take runoff and water that's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees  Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by  for example  connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration  Do they allow for pollination  pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities  Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth  and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon    take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities  I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible  they're being done right now  and that it's a darn good thing. Because right now  our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawken said   by stealing the future  selling it in the present and calling it GDP.  And if we have another eight billion or seven billion  or six billion  even  people  living on a planet where their cities also steal the future  we're going to run out of future really fast. But if we think differently  I think that  in fact  we can have cities that are not only zero emissions  but have unlimited possibilities as well. Thank you very much. For as long as I can remember  I have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean. And at this age  my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin. And when I first learned about endangered species  I was truly distressed to know that every day animals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever. And I wanted to do something to help  but I always wondered  what could one person possibly do to make a difference  And it would be    years  but I would eventually get the answer to that question. When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill  a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying   We should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released.  And I could not disagree more. And in addition  I believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life. And I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this. On June   rd        a ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town  South Africa  spilling       tons of fuel  which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of African penguins. Now the ship sank between Robben Island to the south and Dassen Island to the north. And these are two of the penguins' main breeding islands. And exactly six years and three days earlier  on June   th        a ship named the Apollo Sea sank near Dassen Island  oiling        penguins    half of which died. Now when the Treasure sank in       it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin    which at the time  was listed as a threatened species. And soon  nearly        penguins were covered with this toxic oil. And the local seabird rescue center  named SANCCOB  immediately launched a massive rescue operation    and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken. Now at the time  I was working down the street. I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium. And exactly    years ago yesterday  the phone rang in the penguin office. And with that call  my life would change forever. It was Estelle van der Meer calling from SANCCOB  saying   Please come help. We have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing  but completely inexperienced  volunteers. And we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them.  So two days later  I was on a plane headed for Cape Town with a team of penguin specialists. And the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal. In fact  many people compared it to a war zone. And last week  a    year old girl asked me   What did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw so many oiled penguins   And this is what happened. I was instantly transported back to that moment in time. Penguins are very vocal birds and really  really noisy. And so I expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking  but instead  when we stepped through those doors and into the building  it was eerily silent. So it was very clear these were stressed  sick  traumatized birds. The other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers. Up to       people a day came to the rescue center  and eventually  over the course of this rescue  more than    and a half thousand volunteers came from all over the world to Cape Town to help save these birds. And the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there    yet they were. So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity  this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe inspiring. So the day after we arrived  two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two  and room two had more than       oiled penguins in it. Now mind you  three days earlier  we had    penguins under our care  so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified    at least I was. Personally  I really didn't know if I was capable of handling such a monstrous task. And collectively  we really didn't know if we could pull this off. Because we all knew that just six years earlier  half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued and only half of them had survived. So would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins  We just did not know. But what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers    three of whom here are force feeding penguins. And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves. And what you should know about African penguins is that they have razor sharp beaks. And before long  our bodies were covered head to toe with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins. Now the day after we arrived  a new crisis began to unfold. The oil slick was now moving north towards Dassen Island  and the rescuers despaired  because they knew if the oil hit  it would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds. And there really were no good solutions. But then finally  one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea. He said   Okay  why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled     they collected            and we'll ship them     miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home.  So three of those penguins    Peter  Pamela and Percy    wore satellite tags  and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home  the oil would be cleaned up from their islands. And luckily  the day they arrived  it was. So it had been a huge gamble  but it had paid off. And so they know now that they can use this strategy in future oil spills. So in wildlife rescue  as in life  we learn from each previous experience  and we learn from both our successes and our failures. And the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in '   was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks    because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once. So in these six years between these two oil spills  they built thousands of these well ventilated boxes  and as a result  during the Treasure rescue  just     penguins died during the transport process  as opposed to      . So this alone was a huge victory. Something else learned during the Apollo rescue was how to train the penguins to take fish freely from their hands  using these training boxes. And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue. But an interesting thing was noted during the training process. The first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier. So penguins learn from previous experience  too. So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies. And it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin. And when you clean a penguin  you first have to spray it with a degreaser. And this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue. About a year prior to this oil spill  a    year old student had invented a degreaser. And they'd been using it at SANCCOB with great success  so they began using it during the Treasure rescue. But part way through  they ran out. So in a panic  Estelle from SANCCOB called the student and said   Please  you have to make more.  So he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds. So I just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of animals. So what happened to those        oiled penguins  And was Silvia Gaus right  Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway  Well she could not be more wrong. After half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor  more than    percent of those oiled penguins were successfully returned to the wild. And we know from follow up studies that they have lived just as long as never oiled penguins  and bred nearly as successfully. And in addition  about       penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised. And again  we know from long term monitoring that more of these hand raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do parent raised chicks. So  armed with this knowledge  SANCCOB has a chick bolstering project. And every year they rescue and raise abandoned chicks  and they have a very impressive    percent success rate. And this is critically important because  one year ago  the African penguin was declared endangered. And they could be extinct in less than    years  if we don't do something now to protect them. So what did I learn from this intense and unforgettable experience  Personally  I learned that I am capable of handling so much more than I ever dreamed possible. And I learned that one person can make a huge difference. Just look at that    year old. And when we come together and work as one  we can achieve extraordinary things. And truly  to be a part of something so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have. So I'd like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge  if you will. My mission as the penguin lady is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins  but why should any of you care about penguins  Well  you should care because they're an indicator species. And simply put  if penguins are dying  it means our oceans are dying  and we ultimately will be affected  because  as Sylvia Earle says   The oceans are our life support system.  And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming. And these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about. So if we each do our part  together  we can make a difference  and we can help keep penguins from going extinct. Humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins  but we are now their only hope. Thank you. I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world. I couldn't understand the starvation  the destruction  the killing of innocent people. Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do. And when I was     I became an actor. I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications. I was told I was dyslexic. In fact  I have got qualifications. I got a D in pottery  which was the one thing that I did get    which was useful  obviously. And so concern is where all of this comes from. And then  being an actor  I was doing these different kinds of things  and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in really wasn't cutting it  that there surely had to be more. And at that point  I read a book by Frank Barnaby  this wonderful nuclear physicist  and he said that media had a responsibility  that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward. And that fascinated me  because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life. And then I thought  well maybe I could do something. Maybe I could become a filmmaker. Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference. Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in. So I started thinking about peace  and I was obviously  as I said to you  very much moved by these images  trying to make sense of that. Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on  Because it's obviously incredibly frightening. But I realized that  having been messing around with structure as an actor  that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough  that there needed to be a mountain to climb  there needed to be a journey that I had to take. And if I took that journey  no matter whether it failed or succeeded  it would be completely irrelevant. The point was that I would have something to hook the questions of    is humankind fundamentally evil  Is the destruction of the world inevitable  Should I have children  Is that a responsible thing to do  Etc.  etc. So I was thinking about peace  and then I was thinking  well where's the starting point for peace  And that was when I had the idea. There was no starting point for peace. There was no day of global unity. There was no day of intercultural cooperation. There was no day when humanity came together  separate in all of those things and just shared it together    that we're in this together  and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated  then that might be the key to humanity's survival. That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces    if we did it just for a day. So obviously we didn't have any money. I was living at my mom's place. And we started writing letters to everybody. You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do to fathom that out. How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day  the   st of September  And I wanted it to be the   st of September because it was my granddad's favorite number. He was a prisoner of war. He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki. It poisoned his blood. He died when I was   . So he was like my hero. And the reason why    was the number is     men left     came back  two died on the boat and    hit the ground. And that's why we wanted it to be the   st of September as the date of peace. So we began this journey  and we launched it in     . And we wrote to heads of state  their ambassadors  Nobel Peace laureates  NGOs  faiths  various organizations    literally wrote to everybody. And very quickly  some letters started coming back. And we started to build this case. And I remember the first letter. One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama. And of course we didn't have the money  we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of  this mail . A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying   This is an amazing thing. Come and see me. I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace.  And we didn't have money for the flight. And I rang Sir Bob Ayling  who was CEO of BA at the time  and said   Mate  we've got this invitation. Could you give me a flight  Because we're going to go see him.  And of course  we went and saw him and it was amazing. And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward. And actually  let me go back to that slide  because when we launched it in         this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non violence    we invited thousands of people. Well not thousands    hundreds of people  lots of people    all the press  because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day  a peace day. And we invited everybody  and no press showed up. There were     people there    they were mostly my friends and family. And that was kind of like the launch of this thing. But it didn't matter because we were documenting  and that was the thing. For me  it was really about the process. It wasn't about the end result. And that's the beautiful thing about the camera. They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is. And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually. So anyway  we began the journey. And here you see people like Mary Robinson  I went to see in Geneva. I'm cutting my hair  it's getting short and long  because every time I saw Kofi Annan  I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it  and that was kind of what was going on. Yeah  I'm not worried about it now. So Mary Robinson  she said to me   Listen  this is an idea whose time has come. This must be created.  Kofi Annan said   This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground.  The OAU at the time  led by Salim Ahmed Salim  said   I must get the African countries involved.  Dr. Oscar Arias  Nobel Peace laureate  president now of Costa Rica  said   I'll do everything that I can.  So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States. I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks  and so on and so on and so on    while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense. And then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.    countries in the last    years  I've visited. And I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone. I've recorded        young people. I've recorded about     hours of their thoughts. I'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry  their art  their literature  their music  their sport  whatever it might be. And we were listening to everybody. And it was an incredibly thing  working with the U.N. and working with NGOs and building this case. I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day. And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was  the better chance we had of creating this day. And it was this stuff  this  where I actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened  it didn't actually matter. It didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace. The fact is that  if I tried and it didn't work  then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite    until  it was in Somalia  picking up that young girl. And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic  and that young boy who was a child soldier  who told me he'd killed people    he was about       these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop. And that actually  at that moment something happened to me  which obviously made me go   I'm going to document. If this is the only film that I ever make  I'm going to document until this becomes a reality.  Because we've got to stop  we've got to do something where we unite    separate from all the politics and religion that  as a young person  is confusing me. I don't know how to get involved in that process. And then on the seventh of September  I was invited to New York. The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly  with    co sponsors  the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day  the   st of September  as a fixed calendar date  and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world. Yeah  but there were hundreds of individuals  obviously  who made that a reality. And thank you to all of them. That was an incredible moment. I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen. And as I mentioned  when it started  we were at the Globe  and there was no press. And now I was thinking   Well  the press it really going to hear this story.  And suddenly  we started to institutionalize this day. Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the   th to do a press conference. And it was      AM when I stood there. And I was waiting for him to come down  and I knew that he was on his way. And obviously he never came down. The statement was never made. The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence. And it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives  there and then subsequently all over the world. It never happened. And I remember thinking   This is exactly why  actually  we have to work even harder. And we have to make this day work. It's been created  nobody knows. But we have to continue this journey  and we have to tell people  and we have to prove it can work.  And I left New York freaked  but actually empowered. And I felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did  then maybe we wouldn't see things like that. I remember putting that film out and going to cynics. I was showing the film  and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film    that it's just a day of peace  it doesn't mean anything. It's not going to work  you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan  the Taliban won't listen  etc.  etc. It's just symbolism. And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways  because it couldn't not work. I'd spoken in Somalia  Burundi  Gaza  the West Bank  India  Sri Lanka  Congo  wherever it was  and they'd all tell me   If you can create a window of opportunity  we can move aid  we can vaccinate children. Children can lead their projects. They can unite. They can come together. If people would stop  lives will be saved.  That's what I'd heard. And I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about. And so I went back to the United Nations. I decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie. And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years. We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system  governments and NGOs  trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it  see if we could make it possible. And after lots and lots of meetings obviously  I'm delighted that this man  Ahmad Fawzi  one of my heroes and mentors really  he managed to get UNICEF involved. And UNICEF  God bless them  they said   Okay  we'll have a go.  And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan. It was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan with UNAMA and WHO and civil society  etc.  etc.  etc.  And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it  and I was thinking   This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working. But even if it doesn't  at least the door is open and there's a chance.  And so I went back to London  and I went and saw this chap  Jude Law. And I saw him because he was an actor  I was an actor  I had a connection to him  because we needed to get to the press  we needed this attraction  we needed the media to be involved. Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more    when we got into certain areas  maybe there would be more people interested. And maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more  which had been desperately difficult. I won't go into that. So Jude said   Okay  I'll do some statements for you.  While I was filming these statements  he said to me   Where are you going next   I said   I'm going to go to Afghanistan.  He said   Really   And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest. So I said to him   Do you want to come with me  It'd be really interesting if you came. It would help and bring attention. And that attention would help leverage the situation  as well as all of the other sides of it.  I think there's a number of pillars to success. One is you've got to have a great idea. The other is you've got to have a constituency  you've got to have finance  and you've got to be able to raise awareness. And actually I could never raise awareness by myself  no matter what I'd achieved. So these guys were absolutely crucial. So he said yes  and we found ourselves in Afghanistan. It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there  I was talking to various people  and they were saying to me   You've got to get everybody involved here. You can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work.  And we did  and we traveled around  and we spoke to elders  we spoke to doctors  we spoke to nurses  we held press conferences  we went out with soldiers  we sat down with ISAF  we sat down with NATO  we sat down with the U.K. government. I mean  we basically sat down with everybody    in and out of schools with ministers of education  holding these press conferences  which of course  now were loaded with press  everybody was there. There was an interest in what was going on. This amazing woman  Fatima Gailani  was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians. And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere. And she was really crucial in getting the message in. And then we went home. We'd sort of done it. We had to wait now and see what happened. And I got home  and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the Taliban. And that letter basically said   We'll observe this day. We will observe this day. We see it as a window of opportunity. And we will not engage. We're not going to engage.  And that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn't be kidnapped or killed. And then suddenly  I obviously knew at this point  there was a chance. And days later   .  million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping. And like the General Assembly  obviously the most wonderful  wonderful moment. And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back. We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects. We went back to Afghanistan  because the next year was coming  and we wanted to support. But more importantly  we wanted to go back  because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes. They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it  etc.  etc.    and they made it real. And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say   Look  you guys made this possible. And thank you very much.  And we gave the film over. Obviously it was shown  and it was amazing. And then that year  that year        this ISAF statement from Kabul  Afghanistan  September   th   General Stanley McChrystal  commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan  announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations on the   st of September.  They were saying they would stop. And then there was this other statement that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety saying that  in Afghanistan  because of this work  the violence was down by    percent.    percent reduction in violence on this day at least. And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything. And I remember being stuck in New York  this time because of the volcano  which was obviously much less harmful. And I was there thinking about what was going on. And I kept thinking about this    percent.    percent reduction in violence    in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do. And that made me think that  if we can get    percent in Afghanistan  then surely we can get    percent reduction everywhere. We have to go for a global truce. We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce  go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities  both domestically and internationally  ever recorded. That's exactly what we must do. And on the   st of September this year  we're going to launch that campaign at the O  Arena to go for that process  to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities. And we will utilize all kinds of things    have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website  sign the petition. And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations. And we'll globally link with government  inter government  non government  education  unions  sports. And you can see the education box there. We've got resources at the moment in     countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce. And obviously the life saving is increased  the concepts help. Linking up with the Olympics    I went and saw Seb Coe. I said   London      is about truce. Ultimately  that's what it's about.  Why don't we all team up  Why don't we bring truce to life  Why don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce  We'll make a new film about this process. We'll utilize sport and football. On the Day of Peace  there's thousands of football matches all played  from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be. So  utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action. And ultimately  we have to try that. We have to work together. And when I stand here in front of all of you  and the people who will watch these things  I'm excited  on behalf of everybody I've met  that there is a possibility that our world could unite  that we could come together as one  that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues  brought about by individuals. I was with Brahimi  Ambassador Brahimi. I think he's one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics    in Afghanistan  in Iraq. He's an amazing man. And I sat with him a few weeks ago. And I said to him   Mr. Brahimi  is this nuts  going for a global truce  Is this possible  Is it really possible that we could do this   He said   It's absolutely possible.  I said   What would you do  Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system   He said   No  I'd talk to the individuals.  It's all about the individuals. It's all about you and me. It's all about partnerships. It's about your constituencies  it's about your businesses. Because together  by working together  I seriously think we can start to change things. And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience  and I don't know where he is  who said to me a few days ago    because I did a little rehearsal    and he said   I've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with     squares  and one of them is white.  And it then made me think about a glass of water  which is clear. If you put one drop  one drop of something  in that water  it'll change it forever. By working together  we can create peace one day. Thank you TED. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. Thank you. Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling  but whose streets we can't walk. By studying those twinkling lights though  we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life. In this image of the Tokyo skyline  I've hidden data from the newest planet hunting space telescope on the block  the Kepler Mission. Can you see it  There we go. This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at  where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over         stars  all at once  every half hour  and very precisely. And what we're looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us. In just over two years of operations  we've found over       potential new planetary systems around other stars. To give you some perspective  in the previous two decades of searching  we had only known about     prior to Kepler. When we see these little dips in the light  we can determine a number of things. For one thing  we can determine that there's a planet there  but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star. That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall. And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire  You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm  but not so close that you're too toasty and you get burned. However  there's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall. And I'll tell you why. This is our star. This is our Sun. It's shown here in visible light. That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes. You'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball    that Sun that we all draw when we're children. But you'll notice something else  and that's that the face of the Sun has freckles. These freckles are called sunspots  and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun's magnetic field. They also cause the light from the star to vary. And we can measure this very  very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects. However  these are just the tip of the iceberg. If we had UV eyes or X ray eyes  we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun's magnetic activity    the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well. Just think  even when it's cloudy outside  these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time. So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable  whether it might be amenable to life  we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is  but we want to know about its space weather    this high energy radiation  the UV and the X rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high energy radiation. And so  we can't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system. I'm showing here Venus  Earth and Mars    three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size  but only one of which is really a good place to live. But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe. Kepler won't find a planet around every single star it looks at. But really  every measurement it makes is precious  because it's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets  and how it's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe. While it's Kepler the telescope  the instrument that stares  it's we  life  who are searching. Thank you. So the type of magic I like  and I'm a magician  is magic that uses technology to create illusions. So I would like to show you something I've been working on. It's an application that I think will be useful for artists    multimedia artists in particular. It synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices. I borrowed these three iPods from people here in the audience to show you what I mean. And I'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject  deception. One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain. He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes. But it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful. the creation of life. Marco Tempest  When asked about deception  he said this  Announcer  Magic is the only honest profession. A magician promises to deceive you    and he does. MT  I like to think of myself as an honest magician. I use a lot of tricks  which means that sometimes I have to lie to you. Now I feel bad about that. But people lie every day. Hold on. Phone  Hey  where are you  MT  Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon. You've all done it. Right  I'll be ready in just a minute  darling. Center  It's just what I've always wanted. Left  You were great. MT  Deception  it's a fundamental part of life. Now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women    assuming the women they asked told the truth. We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses. The Chinese general Sun Tzu said that all war was based on deception. Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance. Some people deceive for money. Let's play a game. Three cards  three chances. Announcer  One five will get you        will get you   . Now  where's the lady  Where is the queen  MT  This one  Sorry. You lose. Well  I didn't deceive you. You deceived yourself. Self deception. That's when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth. Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart. Compulsive gamblers are experts at self deception. They believe they can win. They forget the times they lose. The brain is very good at forgetting. Bad experiences are quickly forgotten. Bad experiences quickly disappear. Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos  we are so wonderfully optimistic. Our self deception becomes a positive illusion    why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures  why we believe Romeo when he says he loves Juliet  and why single notes of music  when played together  become a sonata and conjure up meaning. That's  Clair De lune.  Its composer  called Debussy  said that art was the greatest deception of all. Art is a deception that creates real emotions    a lie that creates a truth. And when you give yourself over to that deception  it becomes magic.  MAGIC  Thank you. Thank you very much. So  I was in the hospital for a long time. And a few years after I left  I went back  and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me    said   Dan  I have a fantastic new treatment for you.  I was very excited. I walked with him to his office. And he explained to me that  when I shave  I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is  but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair  and this creates lack of symmetry. And what's the brilliant idea he had  He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric. It sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave. Let me tell you  this was a strange way to shave  because I thought about it and I realized that the way I was shaving then would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life    because I had to keep the width the same. When I got back to his office  I wasn't really sure. I said   Can I see some evidence for this   So he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots    not very informative. I said   What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white  What would happen then    Oh  don't worry about it   he said.  We have lasers  we can whiten it out.  But I was still concerned  so I said   You know what  I'm not going to do it.  And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life. This is coming from a Jewish guy  all right  so that means a lot. And he said   Dan  what's wrong with you  Do you enjoy looking non symmetric  Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this  Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently   None of those happened. And this was very surprising to me  because I've gone through many treatments    there were many treatments I decided not to do    and I never got this guilt trip to this extent. But I decided not to have this treatment. And I went to his deputy and asked him   What was going on  Where was this guilt trip coming from   And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already  and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing. Now you probably think that this guy's a schmuck. Right  that's what he seems like. But let me give you a different perspective on the same story. A few years ago  I was running some of my own experiments in the lab. And when we run experiments  we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another. So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high  another group that I thought their performance would be very low  and when I got the results  that's what we got    I was very happy    aside from one person. There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly. And he pulled the whole mean down  destroying my statistical significance of the test. So I looked carefully at this guy. He was    some years older than anybody else in the sample. And I remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy.  Fantastic   I thought.  Let's throw him out. Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample   But a couple of days later  we thought about it with my students  and we said   What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition  What would have happened if he was in the other group  Would we have thrown him out then   We probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all  and if we did look at the data  we'd probably have said   Fantastic  What a smart guy who is performing this low   because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower  giving us even stronger statistical results than we could. So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment. But you know  these stories  and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest  basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me. The first one is that in life we encounter many people who  in some way or another  try to tattoo our faces. They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased. And I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize  and we see that it happens. Maybe we don't recognize it every time  but we understand that it happens. The most difficult thing  of course  is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives. And that's a much  much more difficult lesson to take into account. Because we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us. When I was doing these experiments  in my mind  I was helping science. I was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through. I wasn't doing something bad. In my mind  I was actually a knight trying to help science move along. But this was not the case. I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions. And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us  and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it  but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors  because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances. I do want to leave you with one positive thought. I mean  this is all very depressing  right    people have conflicts of interest  we don't see it  and so on. The positive perspective  I think  of all of this is that  if we do understand when we go wrong  if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail  we can actually hope to fix things. And that  I think  is the hope. Thank you very much. What I want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans. But before doing that  I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know  that our genomes  our genetic material  are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of DNA  which is this famous double helical molecule. And the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters A  T  C and G. And the information is there twice    one on each strand    which is important  because when new cells are formed  these strands come apart  new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process. But nothing  of course  in nature is totally perfect  so sometimes an error is made and a wrong letter is built in. And we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare DNA sequences among us here in the room  for example. If we compare my genome to the genome of you  approximately every              letters will differ between us. And these mutations accumulate approximately as a function of time. So if we add in a chimpanzee here  we will see more differences. Approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee. And if you're then interested in the history of a piece of DNA  or the whole genome  you can reconstruct the history of the DNA with those differences you observe. And generally we depict our ideas about this history in the form of trees like this. In this case  it's very simple. The two human DNA sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently. Farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees. And because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time  you can transform these differences to estimates of time  where the two humans  typically  will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago  and with the chimpanzees  it will be in the order of five million years ago. So what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to see many  many pieces of DNA very quickly. So we can now  in a matter of hours  determine a whole human genome. Each of us  of course  contains two human genomes    one from our mothers and one from our fathers. And they are around three billion such letters long. And we will find that the two genomes in me  or one genome of mine we want to use  will have about three million differences in the order of that. And what you can then also begin to do is to say   How are these genetic differences distributed across the world   And if you do that  you find a certain amount of genetic variation in Africa. And if you look outside Africa  you actually find less genetic variation. This is surprising  of course  because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in Africa than outside Africa. Yet the people inside Africa have more genetic variation. Moreover  almost all these genetic variants we see outside Africa have closely related DNA sequences that you find inside Africa. But if you look in Africa  there is a component of the genetic variation that has no close relatives outside. So a model to explain this is that a part of the African variation  but not all of it   has  gone out and colonized the rest of the world. And together with the methods to date these genetic differences  this has led to the insight that modern humans    humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me    evolved in Africa  quite recently  between     and         years ago. And later  between     and        years ago or so  went out of Africa to colonize the rest of the world. So what I often like to say is that  from a genomic perspective  we are all Africans. We either live inside Africa today  or in quite recent exile. Another consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally distributed widely in the world  in many places  and they tend to vary as gradients  from a bird's eye perspective at least. And since there are many genetic variants  and they have different such gradients  this means that if we determine a DNA sequence    a genome from one individual    we can quite accurately estimate where that person comes from  provided that its parents or grandparents haven't moved around too much. But does this then mean  as many people tend to think  that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people    on different continents  for example  Well we can begin to ask those questions also. There is  for example  a project that's underway to sequence a thousand individuals    their genomes    from different parts of the world. They've sequenced     Africans from two populations in Africa.  They've  sequenced approximately equally  as  many people in Europe and in China. And we can begin to say how much variance do we find  how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences. And it's a lot     million variable positions. But we can then ask  Are there any absolute differences between Africans and non Africans  Perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed. And with absolute difference    and I mean a difference where people inside Africa at a certain position  where all individuals        percent    have one letter  and everybody outside Africa has another letter. And the answer to that  among those millions of differences  is that there is not a single such position. This may be surprising. Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so. So we can relax the criterion a bit and say  How many positions do we find where    percent of people in Africa have one variant     percent another variant  and the number of that is   . So this is very surprising. It means that when we look at people and see a person from Africa and a person from Europe or Asia  we cannot  for a single position in the genome with     percent accuracy  predict what the person would carry. And only for    positions can we hope to be    percent right. This may be surprising  because we can  of course  look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from. So what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see    facial features  skin color  hair structure    are not determined by single genes with big effects  but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world. There is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that I think is worthwhile to consider  and that is that  in a very literal sense  they're really on the surface of our bodies. They are what we just said    facial features  hair structure  skin color. There are also a number of features that vary between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest  or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies. But so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment  in a direct confrontation  if you like. It's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them. But if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don't directly interact with the environment    our kidneys  our livers  our hearts    there is no way to say  by just looking at these organs  where in the world they would come from. So there's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in Africa  and that is that when those humans emerged around         years ago or so  they were not alone on the planet. There were other forms of humans around  most famously perhaps  Neanderthals    these robust forms of humans  compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right    that existed in Western Asia and Europe since several hundreds of thousands of years. So an interesting question is  what happened when we met  What happened to the Neanderthals  And to begin to answer such questions  my research group    since over    years now    works on methods to extract DNA from remains of Neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old. So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA  how you convert it to a form you can sequence. You have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with DNA from yourself. And this then  in conjunction with these methods that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly  allowed us last year to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome  so that any one of you can now look on the Internet  on the Neanderthal genome  or at least on the    percent of it that we've been able to reconstruct so far. And you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today. And one question that you may then want to ask is  what happened when we met  Did we mix or not  And the way to ask that question is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today. So we then look to do this with pairs of individuals  starting with two Africans  looking at the two African genomes  finding places where they differ from each other  and in each case ask  What is a Neanderthal like  Does it match one African or the other African  We would expect there to be no difference  because Neanderthals were never in Africa. They should be equal  have no reason to be closer to one African than another African. And that's indeed the case. Statistically speaking  there is no difference in how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other. But this is different if we now look at the European individual and an African. Then  significantly more often  does a Neanderthal match the European rather than the African. The same is true if we look at a Chinese individual versus an African  the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often. This may also be surprising because the Neanderthals were never in China. So the model we've proposed to explain this is that when modern humans came out of Africa sometime after         years ago  they met Neanderthals. Presumably  they did so first in the Middle East  where there were Neanderthals living. If they then mixed with each other there  then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside Africa carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world. So that today  the people living outside Africa have about two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals. So having now a Neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the DNA  we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world. And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia in the Altai Mountains at a place called Denisova  a cave site in this mountain here  where archeologists in      found a tiny little piece of bone    this is a copy of it    that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human. And it was well enough preserved so we could determine the DNA from this individual  even to a greater extent than for the Neanderthals actually  and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome and to people today. And we found that this individual shared a common origin for his DNA sequences with Neanderthals around         years ago. And further back          years ago is there a common origin with present day humans. So this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with Neanderthals  but far back and then have a long independent history. We call this group of humans  that we then described for the first time from this tiny  tiny little piece of bone  the Denisovans  after this place where they were first described. So we can then ask for Denisovans the same things as for the Neanderthals  Did they mix with ancestors of present day people  If we ask that question  and compare the Denisovan genome to people around the world  we surprisingly find no evidence of Denisovan DNA in any people living even close to Siberia today. But we do find it in Papua New Guinea and in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific. So this presumably means that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past  since we don't think that the ancestors of Melanesians were ever in Siberia. So from studying these genomes of extinct humans  we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of Africa. In the West  there were Neanderthals  in the East  there were Denisovans    maybe other forms of humans too that we've not yet described. We don't know quite where the borders between these people were  but we know that in Southern Siberia  there were both Neanderthals and Denisovans at least at some time in the past. Then modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa  came out of Africa  presumably in the Middle East. They meet Neanderthals  mix with them  continue to spread over the world  and somewhere in Southeast Asia  they meet Denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the Pacific. And then these earlier forms of humans disappear  but they live on a little bit today in some of us    in that people outside of Africa have two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals  and people in Melanesia actually have an additional five percent approximately from the Denisovans. Does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside Africa and inside Africa in that people outside Africa have this old component in their genome from these extinct forms of humans  whereas Africans do not  Well I don't think that is the case. Presumably  modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa. They spread across Africa also  of course  and there were older  earlier forms of humans there. And since we mixed elsewhere  I'm pretty sure that one day  when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in Africa  we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in Africa. So to sum up  what have we learned from studying genomes of present day humans and extinct humans  We learn perhaps many things  but one thing that I find sort of important to mention is that I think the lesson is that we have always mixed. We mixed with these earlier forms of humans  wherever we met them  and we mixed with each other ever since. Thank you for your attention. I'm a filmmaker. For the last   years  I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means. When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States  one question always comes up  Where is the Palestinian Gandhi  Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance  The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers. These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region. Yet  most of you have probably never heard about them. This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful. So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention  the power of your attention  and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank  Gaza and elsewhere    but today  my case study is going to be Palestine. I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence  but for us to start paying attention to those who already are. Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus. About seven years ago  they faced extinction  because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier  and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village. They would lose    percent of their land and be surrounded  so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank. Through inspired local leadership  they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening. Let me show you some brief clips  so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground. Palestinian Woman  We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel. Here in Budrus  we realized the wall would steal our land. Israeli Man  The fence has  in fact  created a solution to terror. Man  Today you're invited to a peaceful march. You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters. Israeli Activist  Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition. Woman  We saw the men trying to push the soldiers  but none of them could do that. But I think the girls could do it. Fatah Party Member  We must empty our minds of traditional thinking. Hamas Party Member  We were in complete harmony  and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine. Chanting  One united nation. Fatah  Hamas and the Popular Front  News Anchor  The clashes over the fence continue. Reporter  Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd. They were allowed to use any force necessary. Man  These are live bullets. It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere. Israeli Activist  I was sure we were all going to die. But there were others around me who weren't even cowering. Israeli Soldier  A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the  unclear . Protester  This is a peaceful march. There is no need to use violence. Chanting  We can do it  We can do it  We can do it  Julia Bacha  When I first heard about the story of Budrus  I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago  in     . What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful. The residents  after    months of peaceful resistance  convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line  which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem. Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories. This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow  or even survive  in Palestine. Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common  they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause. If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue  it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight. The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room. The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit. The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior  since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it. Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children. But that's true for adults too. In fact  the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced  depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention. I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today. In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank  in Gaza and in East Jerusalem  I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation. In a village called Wallajeh  which sits very close to Jerusalem  the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus. They were going to be surrounded  lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access  either to the West Bank or Jerusalem. They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention. So we organized a screening. A week later  they held the most well attended and disciplined demonstration to date. The organizers say that the villagers  upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film  felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing  that people cared. So they kept on going. On the Israeli side  there is a new peace movement called Solidariot  which means solidarity in Hebrew. The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools. They report that Israelis who had never been active before  upon seeing the film  understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities. The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior. Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in  Ni'lin  Wallajeh  in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan    the nonviolent leaders would become more visible  valued and effective in their work. I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts  they are invisible  and it's as if they never happened. But I have seen first hand that if we do  they will multiply. If they multiply  their influence will grow in the overall Israeli Palestinian conflict. And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation. These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus. Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere. Thank you. Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things. I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self assembling  replicating and repairing themselves. So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing  and then compare that to some natural systems. So in the current state of manufacturing  we have skyscrapers    two and a half years  of assembly time           to a million parts  fairly complex  new  exciting technologies in steel  concrete  glass. We have exciting machines that can take us into space    five years  of assembly time    .  million parts. But on the other side  if you look at the natural systems  we have proteins that have two million types  can fold in        nanoseconds  or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour. So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems  but they're extremely efficient  far more efficient than anything we can build  far more complex than anything we can build. They're far more efficient in terms of energy. They hardly ever make mistakes. And they can repair themselves for longevity. So there's something super interesting about natural systems. And if we can translate that into our built environment  then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things. And I think the key to that is self assembly. So if we want to utilize self assembly in our physical environment  I think there's four key factors. The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build    so our buildings and machines. And we need to decode that into simple sequences    basically the DNA of how our buildings work. Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up  or reconfigure. We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate  allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program. And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want. So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self assembling future. The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot. So these projects are large scale reconfigurable robots      ft.     ft. long proteins. They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices  sensors. You decode what you want to fold up into  into a sequence of angles    so negative      negative                 negative        something like that  so a sequence of angles  or turns  and you send that sequence through the string. Each unit takes its message    so negative        it rotates to that  checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor. So these are the brilliant scientists  engineers  designers that worked on this project. And I think it really brings to light  Is this really scalable  I mean  thousands of dollars  lots of man hours made to make this eight foot robot. Can we really scale this up  Can we really embed robotics into every part  The next one questions that and looks at passive nature  or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability. But it goes a step further  and it tries to have actual computation. It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing  the digital logic gate  directly into your parts. So this is a NAND gate. You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing  and you have two input tetrahedrons. One of them is the input from the user  as you're building your bricks. The other one is from the previous brick that was placed. And then it gives you an output in  D space. So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do. It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do. And now it starts moving in three dimensional space    so up or down. So on the left hand side        input equals   output  which goes down. On the right hand side        input is a   output  which goes up. And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build. So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed. So that means that we can have some form of self replication. In this case I call it self guided replication  because your structure contains the exact blueprints. If you have errors  you can replace a part. All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it. So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one. It's directly embedded  there's no external instructions. So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains  and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self assembly systems. So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system. So basically you have a chain of elements. Each element is completely identical  and they're biased. So each chain  or each element  wants to turn right or left. So as you assemble the chain  you're basically programming it. You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left. So when you shake the chain  it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in    so in this case  a spiral  or in this case  two cubes next to each other. So you can basically program any three dimensional shape    or one dimensional  two dimensional    up into this chain completely passively. So what does this tell us about the future  I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self assembly  replication  repair in our physical structures  our buildings  machines. There's new programmability in these parts. And from that you have new possibilities for computing. We'll have spatial computing. Imagine if our buildings  our bridges  machines  all of our bricks could actually compute. That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power  new design possibilities. So it's exciting potential for this. So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future  if we implement these new technologies for a new self assembling world. Thank you. I want to address the issue of compassion. Compassion has many faces. Some of them are fierce  some of them are wrathful  some of them are tender  some of them are wise. A line that the Dalai Lama once said  he said   Love and compassion are necessities. They are not luxuries. Without them  humanity cannot survive.  And I would suggest  it is not only humanity that won't survive  but it is all species on the planet  as we've heard today. It is the big cats  and it's the plankton. Two weeks ago  I was in Bangalore in India. I was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of Bangalore. And early in the morning  I went into the ward. In that hospice  there were    men and women who were actively dying. And I walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly  fragile  obviously in the latter phase of active dying. I looked into her face. I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her  and his face was just riven with grief and confusion. And I remembered a line from the Mahabharata  the great Indian epic   What is the most wondrous thing in the world  Yudhisthira   And Yudhisthira replied   The most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don't realize it can happen to us.  I looked up. Tending those    dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore. I looked into the face of one of these women  and I saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present. I watched her hands as she bathed an old man. My gaze went to another young woman as she wiped the face of another dying person. And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for. Every year or so  I have the privilege of taking clinicians into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever. And on the first day at Simikot in Humla  far west of Nepal  the most impoverished region of Nepal  an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags. And he walked in  and somebody said something to him  we realized he was deaf  and we looked into the rags  and there was this pair of eyes. The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned. Again  the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara. It was the young women  the health aids  who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds. I know those hands and eyes  they touched me as well. They touched me at that time. They have touched me throughout my    years. They touched me when I was four and I lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed. And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me. And that woman did not have sentimental compassion. She had phenomenal strength. And it was really her strength  I believe  that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life. So we can ask  What is compassion comprised of  And there are various facets. And there's referential and non referential compassion. But first  compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering. It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I'm not separate from this suffering. But that is not enough  because compassion  which activates the motor cortex  means that we aspire  we actually aspire to transform suffering. And if we're so blessed  we engage in activities that transform suffering. But compassion has another component  and that component is really essential. That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome. Now I worked with dying people for over    years. I had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security  prison  for six years. And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience  from working with dying people and training caregivers  that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe. And when I worked in the prison system  it was so clear to me  this  that many of us in this room  and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row  the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered. That compassion is actually an inherent human quality. It is there within every human being. But the conditions for compassion to be activated  to be aroused  are particular conditions. I had that condition  to a certain extent  from my own childhood illness. Eve Ensler  whom you'll hear later  has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through. And what is fascinating is that compassion has enemies  and those enemies are things like pity  moral outrage  fear. And you know  we have a society  a world  that is paralyzed by fear. And in that paralysis  of course  our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed. The very word terror is global. The very feeling of terror is global. So our work  in a certain way  is to address this imago  this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe. Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities. For example  A person who is cultivating compassion  when they are in the presence of suffering  they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do. However  they return to baseline a lot sooner. This is called resilience. Many of us think that compassion drains us  but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us. Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration. It hooks up all parts of the brain. Another  which has been discovered by various researchers at Emory and at Davis and so on  is that compassion enhances our immune system. Hey  we live in a very noxious world. Most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho social and physical poisons  of the toxins of our world. But compassion  the generation of compassion  actually mobilizes our immunity. You know  if compassion is so good for us  I have a question. Why don't we train our children in compassion  If compassion is so good for us  why don't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they're supposed to do  which is to really transform suffering  And if compassion is so good for us  why don't we vote on compassion  Why don't we vote for people in our government based on compassion  so that we can have a more caring world  In Buddhism  we say   it takes a strong back and a soft front.  It takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions. And that is the mental quality of equanimity. But it also takes a soft front    the capacity to really be open to the world as it is  to have an undefended heart. And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara  Kuan Yin. It's a female archetype  she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. She stands with        arms  and in every hand  there is an instrument of liberation  and in the palm of every hand  there are eyes  and these are the eyes of wisdom. I say that  for thousands of years  women have lived  exemplified  met in intimacy  the archetype of Avalokitesvara  of Kuan Yin  she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered  unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is. They have infused societies with kindness  and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half. And they have actualized compassion through direct action. Jody Williams called it  It's good to meditate. I'm sorry  you've got to do a little bit of that  Jody. Step back  give your mother a break  okay. But the other side of the equation is you've got to come out of your cave. You have to come into the world like Asanga did  who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha after    years sitting in the cave. He said   I'm out of here.  He's going down the path. He sees something in the path. He looks  it's a dog  he drops to his knees. He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg. The wound is just filled with maggots. He puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots  so as not to harm them. And at that moment  the dog transformed into the Buddha of love and kindness. I believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men    with their fathers  with their sons  with their brothers  with the plumbers  the road builders  the caregivers  the doctors  the lawyers  with our president  and with all beings. The women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire. May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere. Thank you. I didn't always love unintended consequences  but I've really learned to appreciate them. I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress  even when they seem to be terrible. And I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do. Let's go to        years before the present  to the time of the cultural explosion  when music  art  technology  so many of the things that we're enjoying today  so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED were born. And the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation  that if our ancestors        years ago had been able to see what they had done  they wouldn't have really understood it. They were responding to immediate concerns. They were making it possible for us to do what they do  and yet  they didn't really understand how they did it. Now let's advance to        years before the present. And this is when it really gets interesting. What about the domestication of grains  What about the origins of agriculture  What would our ancestors        years ago have said if they really had technology assessment  And I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity  at least in the next few hundred years. It was really bad news. First of all  worse nutrition  maybe shorter life spans. It was simply awful for women. The skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning  noon and night. And politically  it was awful. It was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people. If there had been rational technology assessment then  I think they very well might have said   Let's call the whole thing off.  Even now  our choices are having unintended effects. Historically  for example  chopsticks    according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan    resulted in long term changes in the dentition  in the teeth  of the Japanese public. And we are also changing our teeth right now. There is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time. That's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence. But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal  there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have. So these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand. In the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences  and there was a very healthy sense of caution  reflected in the Tree of Knowledge  in Pandora's Box  and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology. And that's all very true. The physicians of the ancient world    especially the Egyptians  who started medicine as we know it    were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat. And the translations of the surviving texts say   This I will not treat. This I cannot treat.  They were very conscious. So were the followers of Hippocrates. The Hippocratic manuscripts also    repeatedly  according to recent studies    show how important it is not to do harm. More recently  Harvey Cushing  who really developed neurosurgery as we know it  who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook  he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing. But he did his best  and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine. Now if we look forward a bit to the   th century  we find a new style of technology. What we find is  no longer simple tools  but systems. We find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on. And the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid   th century  who were the original hackers. Thomas Edison would have been very  very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today. And these hackers had a word for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems that they called bugs. That was the origin of the word  bug.  This consciousness  though  was a little slow to seep through the general population  even people who were very  very well informed. Samuel Clemens  Mark Twain  was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times    at least until         registered with the U.S. Patent Office. That was the Paige typesetter. The Paige typesetter had        parts. The patent had    pages of text and     figures. It was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type    including returning the type to its place  which was a very difficult thing. And Mark Twain  who knew all about typesetting  really was smitten by this machine. Unfortunately  he was smitten in more ways than one  because it made him bankrupt  and he had to tour the world speaking to recoup his money. And this was an important thing about   th century technology  that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart  even when judged by the most expert people. Now there is something else  though  in the early   th century that made things even more complicated. And that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger. The lesson of the Titanic  for a lot of the contemporaries  was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship. And this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them. However  there was another case  the Eastland  a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in       and it killed     people    that was    more than the passenger toll of the Titanic. The reason for it  in part  was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable. And that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences  it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw. It's really a question of the system  how the ship was loaded  the ballast and many other things. So the   th century  then  saw how much more complex reality was  but it also saw a positive side. It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies. It could benefit from tragedies. And my favorite example of that    which is not really widely known as a technological miracle  but it may be one of the greatest of all times  was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War. Penicillin was discovered in       but even by       no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced. A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it. They were working on it independently  and they weren't getting anywhere. And the Government Research Bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done. And not only did they do it  but within two years  they scaled up penicillin from preparation in one liter flasks to        gallon vats. That was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time. In the Second World War  too  the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain. So there were benefits in calamities    benefits to pure science  as well as to applied science and medicine. Now when we come to the period after the Second World War  unintended consequences get even more interesting. And my favorite example of that occurred beginning in       when it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters  but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating  ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus. Well  technology to the rescue. So chemists got to work  and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems. But something else happened in the early     s  and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States. And IBM  which made them  just didn't know what to do. They commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate  and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts. What happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute traces of tin. And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads. So they reformulated the bactericide. But what's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering  at least indirectly  from a human disease. So it shows that we're really all in this together. In fact  it also shows something interesting  that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically  unfortunately  our ability to model their long term behavior  which has also been increasing  has been increasing only arithmetically. So one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight. One other very positive consequence of   th century technology  though  was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances. There are two historians of business at the University of Maryland  Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch  who have done some extremely interesting work  much of it still unpublished  on the history of major innovations. They have combined the list of major innovations  and they've discovered that the greatest number  the greatest decade  for fundamental innovations  as reflected in all of the lists that others have made    a number of lists that they have merged    was the Great Depression. And nobody knows just why this was so  but one story can reflect something of it. It was the origin of the Xerox copier  which celebrated its   th anniversary last year. And Chester Carlson  the inventor  was a patent attorney. He really was not intending to work in patent research  but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job. So this was the best job he could get. He was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions  and so he started to develop a system of dry photocopying  which he patented in the late     s    and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in     . So we see that sometimes  as a result of these dislocations  as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference  that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity. What does this mean  It means  I think  that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities. Think of the financial world  for example. The mentor of Warren Buffett  Benjamin Graham  developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the      crash. And he published that book in the early     s  and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook. So many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters. Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now    bed bugs  killer bees  spam    and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question. If we think  for example  of Louis Pasteur  who in the     s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry  and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease. So very often  some kind of disaster    sometimes the consequence  for example  of over cultivation of silk worms  which was a problem in Europe at the time    can be the key to something much bigger. So this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences. We need to take a really positive view. We need to see what they can do for us. We need to learn from those figures that I mentioned. We need to learn  for example  from Dr. Cushing  who killed patients in the course of his early operations. He had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes. And he learned meticulously from his mistakes. And as a result  when we say   This isn't brain surgery   that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects. And we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge  to share their knowledge  in the face of an emergency  which they hadn't really been for years and years. They might have been able to do it earlier. The message  then  for me  about unintended consequences is chaos happens  let's make better use of it. Thank you very much. I am the daughter of a forger  not just any forger ... When you hear the word  forger   you often understand  mercenary.  You understand  forged currency    forged pictures.  My father is no such man. For    years of his life  he made false papers    never for himself  always for other people  and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed. Let me introduce him. Here is my father at age   . It all began for him during World War II  when at age    he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop. He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance. And it's not a banal story    after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the '  s. When I was a child I knew nothing about this  of course. This is me in the middle making faces. I grew up in the Paris suburbs and I was the youngest of three children. I had a  normal  dad like everybody else  apart from the fact that he was    years older than ... well  he was basically old enough to be my grandfather. Anyway  he was a photographer and a street educator  and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly. And  of course  he never talked about his past life when he was a forger. There was  however  an incident I'm going to tell you about  that perhaps could have led me suspect something. I was in high school and got a bad grade  a rare event for me  so I decided to hide it from my parents. In order to do that  I set out to forge their signature. I started working on my mother's signature  because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge. So  I got working. I took some sheets of paper and started practicing  practicing  practicing  until I reached what I thought was a steady hand  and went into action. Later  while checking my school bag  my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged. She yelled at me like she never had before. I went to hide in my bedroom  under the blankets  and then I waited for my father to come back from work with  one could say  much apprehension. I heard him come in. I remained under the blankets. He entered my room  sat on the corner of the bed  and he was silent  so I pulled the blanket from my head  and when he saw me he started laughing. He was laughing so hard  he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand. Then he said   But really  Sarah  you could have worked harder  Can't you see it's really too small   Indeed  it's rather small. I was born in Algeria. There I would hear people say my father was a  moudjahid  and that means  fighter.  Later on  in France  I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations  and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life  especially that he had  done  World War II  that he had  done  the Algerian war. And in my head I would be thinking that  doing  a war meant being a soldier. But knowing my father  and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non violent  I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun. And indeed  I was very far from the mark. One day  while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality  I happened to see some documents that caught my attention. These are real  These are mine  I was born an Argentinean. But the document I happened to see that would help us build a case for the authorities was a document from the army that thanked my father for his work on behalf of the secret services. And then  suddenly  I went  wow   My father  a secret agent  It was very James Bond. I wanted to ask him questions  which he didn't answer. And later  I told myself that one day I would have to question him. And then I became a mother and had a son  and finally decided it was time    that he absolutely had to talk to us. I had become a mother and he was celebrating his   th birthday  and suddenly I was very  very afraid. I feared he'd go and take his silences with him  and take his secrets with him. I managed to convince him that it was important for us  but possibly also for other people that he shared his story. He decided to tell it to me and I made a book  from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later. So  his story. My father was born in Argentina. His parents were of Russian descent. The whole family came to settle in France in the '  s. His parents were Jewish  Russian and above all  very poor. So at the age of    my father had to work. And with his only diploma  his primary education certificate  he found himself working at a dyer   dry cleaner. That's where he discovered something totally magical  and when he talks about it  it's fascinating    it's the magic of dyeing chemistry. During that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was   . This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness. All day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn  to accumulate more and more knowledge  and at night  when no one was looking  he'd put his experience to practice. He was mostly interested in ink bleaching. All this to tell you that if my father became a forger  actually  it was almost by accident. His family was Jewish  so they were hounded. Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers. Well  they were out  but they were always in danger. The big  Jew  stamp was still on their papers. It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents. My father had been instilled with such respect for the law that although he was being persecuted  he'd never thought of false papers. But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance. In those times documents had hard covers  they were filled in by hand  and they stated your job. In order to survive  he needed to be working. He asked the man to write  dyer.  Suddenly the man looked very  very interested. As a  dyer   do you know how to bleach ink marks  Of course he knew. And suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem  even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink  called  indelible   the  Waterman  blue ink. And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly how to bleach it. Now  of course  the man was very impressed with this young man of    who could immediately give him the formula  so he recruited him. And actually  without knowing it  my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case  the so called  correction pen.  But it was only the beginning. That's my father. As soon as he got to the lab  even though he was the youngest  he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents. All the movements stopped at falsifying. But demand was ever growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents. He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch. He started a press. He started photoengraving. He started making rubber stamps. He started inventing all kind of things    with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel. Anyway  he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output. He had made a simple calculation  In one hour he could make    forged documents. If he slept one hour     people would die. This sense of responsibility for other people's lives when he was just       and also his guilt for being a survivor  since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not    stayed with him all his life. And this is maybe what explains why  for    years  he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices. I'd like to talk about those sacrifices  because there were many. There were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid. To him  being paid would have meant being a mercenary. If he had accepted payment  he wouldn't be able to say  yes  or  no  depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause. So he was a photographer by day  and a forger by night for    years. He was broke all of the time. Then there were the emotional sacrifices  How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets  How can one explain what one does at night in the lab  every single night  Of course  there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that I understood much later. One day my father introduced me to my sister. He also explained to me that I had a brother  too  and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four  and they were    years older than me. They are both in their sixties now. In order to write the book  I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was  who was the father she had known. She explained that the father that she'd had would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk. They would get all dressed up and wait for him  but he would almost never come. He'd say   I'll call.  He wouldn't call. And then he would not come. Then one day he totally disappeared. Time passed  and they thought he had surely forgotten them  at first. Then as time passed  at the end of almost two years  they thought   Well  perhaps our father has died.  And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful. And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned  orphaned  my father was making false papers. And if he did not tell them  it was of course to protect them. After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel. And then  as he was a staunch anti colonialist  he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war. After the Algerian war  at the heart of the international resistance movements  his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door. In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence  Guinea  Guinea Bissau  Angola. And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti apartheid party. He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans. There was also Latin America. My father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the Dominican Republic  Haiti  and then it was the turn of Brazil  Argentina  Venezuela  El Salvador  Nicaragua  Colombia  Peru  Uruguay  Chile and Mexico. Then there was the Vietnam War. My father made false papers for the American deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese. Europe was not spared either. My father made false papers for the dissidents against Franco in Spain  Salazar in Portugal  against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece  and even in France. There  just once  it happened in May of     . My father watched  benevolently  of course  the demonstrations of the month of May  but his heart was elsewhere  and so was his time because he had over    countries to serve. Once  though  he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize. He was much younger in those days  and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting. He told me that those false papers were the most media relevant and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life. But  he agreed to do it  even though Daniel Cohn Bendit's life was not in danger  just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities  and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders    and that ideas have no borders. All my childhood  while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales  my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles. And those heroes did not need an army behind them. Anyhow  nobody would have followed them  except for a handful  of  men and women of conviction and courage. I understood much later that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep. I asked him whether  considering the sacrifices he had to make  he ever had any regrets. He said no. He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything. He was persuaded  and he's still convinced that another world is possible    a world where no one would ever need a forger. He's still dreaming about it. My father is here in the room today. His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up. Thank you. What I'm going to try and do in the next    minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we're going to make matter come alive. Now this may seem a bit ambitious  but when you look at yourself  you look at your hands  you realize that you're alive. So this is a start. Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth. There's been four billion years of organic  biological life. And as an inorganic chemist  my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic  living world and the inorganic  dead world. And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic  dead matter into living matter  into inorganic biology. Before we do that  I want to kind of put biology in its place. And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology. I love to do synthetic biology. I love things that are alive. I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology. But within that infrastructure  we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution. And evolution  although it was established well over     years ago by Charles Darwin and a vast number of other people  evolution still is a little bit intangible. And when I talk about Darwinian evolution  I mean one thing and one thing only  and that is survival of the fittest. And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way. Think about evolution in terms of offspring competing  and some winning. So bearing that in mind  as a chemist  I wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology  What is the minimal unit of matter that can undergo Darwinian evolution  And this seems quite a profound question. And as a chemist  we're not used to profound questions every day. So when I thought about it  then suddenly I realized that biology gave us the answer. And in fact  the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is  in fact  a single cell    a bacteria. So this raises three really important questions  What is life  Is biology special  Biologists seem to think so. Is matter evolvable  Now if we answer those questions in reverse order  the third question    is matter evolvable     if we can answer that  then we're going to know how special biology is  and maybe  just maybe  we'll have some idea of what life really is. So here's some inorganic life. This is a dead crystal  and I'm going to do something to it  and it's going to become alive. And you can see  it's kind of pollinating  germinating  growing. This is an inorganic tube. And all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago  and they look alive. Of course  they're not alive. It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden. But when I saw this  I was really fascinated  because it seemed lifelike. And as I pause for a few seconds  have a look at the screen. You can see there's architecture growing  filling the void. And this is dead. So I was positive that  if somehow we can make things mimic life  let's go one step further. Let's see if we can actually make life. But there's a problem  because up until maybe a decade ago  we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe. In fact  we were the only people in the universe. Now  that's a bit boring. So as a chemist  I wanted to say   Hang on. What is going on here  Is life that improbable   And this is really the question. I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars. And in fact  let's take that one step further. Let's say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe  maybe the physics of life is as well. And so the problem with chemists    and this is a massive advantage as well    is we like to focus on our elements. In biology  carbon takes center stage. And in a universe where carbon exists and organic biology  then we have all this wonderful diversity of life. In fact  we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate. We're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards. Well what about matter  If we can make matter alive  would we have a matterhazard  So think  this is a serious question. If your pen could replicate  that would be a bit of a problem. So we have to think differently if we're going to make stuff come alive. And we also have to be aware of the issues. But before we can make life  let's think for a second what life really is characterized by. And forgive the complicated diagram. This is just a collection of pathways in the cell. And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing. Synthetic biologists are manipulating it. Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease. And you have all these pathways going on at the same time. You have regulation  information is transcribed  catalysts are made  stuff is happening. But what does a cell do  Well it divides  it competes  it survives. And I think that is where we have to start in terms of thinking about building from our ideas in life. But what else is life characterized by  Well  I like think of it as a flame in a bottle. And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating  metabolizing  burning through chemistries. And so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life  we need to power it somehow. So before we can really start to make life  we have to really think about where it came from. And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere    maybe not in Scotland  maybe in Africa  maybe somewhere else. But the real honest answer is  we just don't know  because there is a problem with the origin. Imagine way back  four and a half billion years ago  there is a vast chemical soup of stuff. And from this stuff we came. So when you think about the improbable nature of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes  just remember  we came from stuff on planet Earth. And we went through a variety of worlds. The RNA people would talk about the RNA world. We somehow got to proteins and DNA. We then got to the last ancestor. Evolution kicked in    and that's the cool bit. And here we are. But there's a roadblock that you can't get past. You can decode the genome  you can look back  you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA  but we can't get further than the last ancestor  the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history. So we don't know how we got here. So there are two options  intelligent design  direct and indirect    so God  or my friend. Now talking about E.T. putting us there  or some other life  just pushes the problem further on. I'm not a politician  I'm a scientist. The other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity. This seems most likely. So we have some kind of primordial soup. And this one happens to be a good source of all    amino acids. And somehow these amino acids are combined  and life begins. But life begins  what does that mean  What is life  What is this stuff of life  So in the     s  Miller Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment  where they did the equivalent in the chemical world. They took the basic ingredients  put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through. And they had a look at what was in the soup  and they found amino acids  but nothing came out  there was no cell. So the whole area's been stuck for a while  and it got reignited in the '  s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on. In my own laboratory  the way we're trying to create inorganic life is by using many different reaction formats. So what we're trying to do is do reactions    not in one flask  but in tens of flasks  and connect them together  as you can see with this flow system  all these pipes. We can do it microfluidically  we can do it lithographically  we can do it in a  D printer  we can do it in droplets for colleagues. And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away. But that's probably going to end in failure  so we need to be a bit more focused. And the answer  of course  lies with mice. This is how I remember what I need as a chemist. I say   Well I want molecules.  But I need a metabolism  I need some energy. I need some information  and I need a container. Because if I want evolution  I need containers to compete. So if you have a container  it's like getting in your car.  This is my car  and I'm going to drive around and show off my car.  And I imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life. So these things together give us evolution  perhaps. And the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal. So what we're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules. And so forgive the molecules on the screen  but these are a very simple kit. There's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present. And we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano molecular molecules the same size of DNA and proteins  but there's no carbon in sight. Carbon is banned. And so with this Lego kit  we have the diversity required for complex information storage without DNA. But we need to make some containers. And just a few months ago in my lab  we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them. And you can see on the screen a cell being made. And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell. And all I wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in membranes  in real cells  and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism  a molecular survival of the fittest. And this movie here shows this competition between molecules. Molecules are competing for stuff. They're all made of the same stuff  but they want their shape to win. They want their shape to persist. And that is the key. If we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete  they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete. If we manage to do that  forget the molecular detail. Let's zoom out to what that could mean. So we have this special theory of evolution that applies only to organic biology  to us. If we could get evolution into the material world  then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution. And that's really worth thinking about. Does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe  Is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete  So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution. So you imagine  if we're able to create a self sustaining artificial life form  not only will this tell us about the origin of life    that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive  it can use anything    we can then take  it  one step further and develop new technologies  because we can then use software control for evolution to code in. So imagine we make a little cell. We want to put it out in the environment  and we want it to be powered by the Sun. What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on. And we don't use design anymore. We find what works. We should take our inspiration from biology. Biology doesn't care about the design unless it works. So this will reorganize the way we design things. But not only just that  we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology. Wouldn't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with  The real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything  because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution. Evolution cannot be cut apart. You need to somehow find the fitness function. And the profound realization for me is that  if this works  the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level  and we really start talking about selfish matter. And what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff  You're sitting on chairs. They're inanimate  they're not alive. But you are made of stuff  and you are using stuff  and you enslave stuff. So using evolution in biology  and in inorganic biology  for me is quite appealing  quite exciting. And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive. And again  when you're thinking about how improbable this is  remember  five billion years ago  we were not here  and there was no life. So what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life  But perhaps  for me as a chemist  I want to keep away from general terms  I want to think about specifics. So what does it mean about defining life  We really struggle to do this. And I think  if we can make inorganic biology  and we can make matter become evolvable  that will in fact define life. I propose to you that matter that can evolve is alive  and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Just a quick question on timeline. You believe you're going to be successful in this project  When  Lee Cronin  So many people think that life took millions of years to kick in. We're proposing to do it in just a few hours  once we've set up the right chemistry. CA  And when do you think that will happen  LC  Hopefully within the next two years. CA  That would be a big story. In your own mind  what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is non carbon based life  walking or oozing or something  LC  I think it's     percent. Because the thing is  we are so chauvinistic to biology  if you take away carbon  there's other things that can happen. So the other thing that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon  maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for. Don't go and look for carbon  go and look for evolvable stuff. CA  Lee Cronin  good luck.  LC  Thank you very much.  Hi everyone. I'm an artist and a dad    second time around. Thank you. And I want to share with you my latest art project. It's a children's book for the iPad. It's a little quirky and silly. It's called  Pop It   And it's about the things little kids do with their parents. So this is about potty training    as most of you  I hope  know. You can tickle the rug. You can make the baby poop. You can do all those fun things. You can burst bubbles. You can draw  as everyone should. But you know  I have a problem with children's books  I think they're full of propaganda. At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope  forget it. It's not the way I was brought up. So I said   I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda.  If you notice carefully  it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child. You don't like it  Shake it  and you have a lesbian couple. Shake it  and you have a heterosexual couple. You know  I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family. I have to tell you about my childhood. I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns  fathers  brothers  sisters. Basically  I was brought up to be a good Samaritan  and I am. And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house  which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood. Basically  I celebrated every religious function. In fact  when there was a wedding in our neighborhood  all of us would paint our houses for the wedding. I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani. We all had to fast during Ramadan. It was a very beautiful time. But I must say  I'll never forget  when I was    years old  this happened. Babri Masjid    one of the most beautiful mosques in India  built by King Babur  I think  in the   th century    was demolished by Hindu activists. This caused major riots in my city. And for the first time  I was affected by this communal unrest. My little five year old kid neighbor comes running in  and he says   Rags  Rags. You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful.  I'm like   Dude  I'm Hindu.  He's like   Huh   You know  my work is inspired by events such as this. Even in my gallery shows  I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid  distill only its emotional residue and image my own life. Imagine history being taught differently. Remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change  I have another idea. It's a children's book about Indian independence    very patriotic. But when you shake it  you get Pakistan's perspective. Shake it again  and you get the British perspective. You have to separate fact from bias  right. Even my books on children have cute  fuzzy animals. But they're playing geopolitics. They're playing out Israel Palestine  India Pakistan. You know  I'm making a very important argument. And my argument  is  that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage. After all  children's books are manuals on parenting  so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives. And conversely  only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy. You know  I can't promise my child a life without bias    we're all biased    but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. Thank you very much. My topic is economic growth in China and India. And the question I want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth. You may say this is not fair  because I'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy. Actually  exactly the opposite is what I'm going to do. I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy  rather than against democracy. The first question there is why China has grown so much faster than India. Over the last    years  in terms of the GDP growth rates  China has grown at twice the rate of India. In the last five years  the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth. But over the last    years  China undoubtedly has done much better than India. One simple answer is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai. Look at the skyline of Shanghai. This is the Pudong area. The picture on India is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai in India. The idea there behind these two pictures is that the Chinese government can act above rule of law. It can plan for the long term benefits of the country and in the process  evict millions of people    that's just a small technical issue. Whereas in India  you cannot do that  because you have to listen to the public. You're being constrained by the public's opinion. Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agrees with that view. In an interview printed in the financial press of India  He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai. This is an Oxford trained economist steeped in humanistic values  and yet he agrees with the high pressure tactics of Shanghai. So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth  that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic development  infrastructures  airports  highways  bridges  things like that. And you need a strong government to do that  because you cannot respect private property rights. You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion. You need also state ownership  especially of land assets  in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly. The implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth  rather than a facilitator of economic growth. Here's the key question. Just how important are infrastructures for economic growth  This is a key issue. If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth  then you would argue a strong government is necessary to promote growth. If you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe  then you will put less emphasis on strong government. So to illustrate that question  let me give you two countries. And for the sake of brevity  I'll call one country Country   and the other country Country  . Country   has a systematic advantage over Country   in infrastructures. Country   has more telephones  and Country   has a longer system of railways. So if I were to ask you   Which is China and which is India  and which country has grown faster   if you believe in the infrastructure view  then you will say   Country   must be China. They must have done better  in terms of economic growth. And Country   is possibly India.  Actually the country with more telephones is the Soviet Union  and the data referred to     . After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones  the country collapsed. That's not too good. The picture there is Khrushchev. I know that in      he no longer ruled the Soviet Union  but that's the best picture that I can find. Telephones  infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth. Country    that has fewer telephones  is China. Since       the country has performed at a double digit rate every year for the last    years. If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union other than the fact about their telephones  you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades. Country    that has a longer system of railways  is actually India. And Country   is China. This is a very little known fact about the two countries. Yes  today China has a huge infrastructure advantage over India. But for many years  until the late     s  China had an infrastructure disadvantage vis a vis India. In developing countries  the most common mode of transportation is the railways  and the British built a lot of railways in India. India is the smaller of the two countries  and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late     s. So clearly  infrastructure doesn't explain why China did better before the late     s  as compared with India. In fact  if you look at the evidence worldwide  the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth. The economy grows  government accumulates more resources  and the government can invest in infrastructure    rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth. And this is clearly the story of the Chinese economic growth. Let me look at this question more directly. Is democracy bad for economic growth  Now let's turn to two countries  Country A and Country B. Country A  in       had about      per capita GDP as compared with Country B  which had      in per capita GDP. By       Country A has surpassed Country B with      per capita GDP as compared with      per capita GDP. Both countries are in Asia. If I were to ask you   Which are the two Asian countries  And which one is a democracy   you may argue   Well  maybe Country A is China and Country B is India.  In fact  Country A is democratic India  and Country B is Pakistan    the country that has a long period of military rule. And it's very common that we compare India with China. That's because the two countries have about the same population size. But the more natural comparison is actually between India and Pakistan. Those two countries are geographically similar. They have a complicated  but shared common history. By that comparison  democracy looks very  very good in terms of economic growth. So why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments  One reason is the East Asian Model. In East Asia  we have had successful economic growth stories such as Korea  Taiwan  Hong Kong and Singapore. Some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the   s and   s and     s. The problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries   Have you won the lottery   And they all tell you   Yes  we have won the lottery.  And then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are     percent. The reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn't end up winning the prize. For each of these successful authoritarian governments in East Asia  there's a matched failure. Korea succeeded  North Korea didn't. Taiwan succeeded  China under Mao Zedong didn't. Burma didn't succeed. The Philippines didn't succeed. If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide  there's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth. So the East Asian model has this massive selection bias    it is known as selecting on a dependent variable  something we always tell our students to avoid. So exactly why did China grow so much faster  I will take you to the Cultural Revolution  when China went mad  and compare that country's performance with India under Indira Gandhi. The question there is  Which country did better  China or India  China was during the Cultural Revolution. It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution  China out perfomed India in terms of GDP growth by an average of about  .  percent every year in terms of per capita GDP. So that's when China was mad. The whole country went mad. It must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the Cultural Revolution. The advantage the country had was human capital    nothing else but human capital. This is the world development index indicator data in the early     s. And this is the earliest data that I can find. The adult literacy rate in China is    percent as compared with    percent in India. The contrast in literacy rates is especially sharp between Chinese women and Indian women. I haven't told you about the definition of literacy. In China  the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write       Chinese characters. In India  the definition of literacy  operating definition of literacy  is the ability  the grand ability  to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak. The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated. If you go to other sources of data such as Human Development Index  that data series  go back to the early     s  you see exactly the same contrast. China held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis a vis India. Life expectancies  as early as       China had a huge advantage in life expectancy. On average  as a Chinese in       you lived    years more than an average Indian. So if you have a choice between being a Chinese and being an Indian  you would want to become a Chinese in order to live    years longer. If you made that decision in       the down side of that is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution. So you have to always think carefully about these decisions. If you cannot chose your nationality  then you will want to become an Indian man. Because  as an Indian man  you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis a vis Indian women. This is an extremely strange fact. It's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern. It shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the Indian society against women. The good news is  by       India has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy. Today  Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over Indian men. So India is reverting to the normal. But India still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality. These are the two pictures taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province and garment factories in India. In China  it's all women.    to    percent of the workforce in China is women in the coastal part of the country  whereas in India  it's all men. Financial Times printed this picture of an Indian textile factory with the title   India Poised to Overtake China in Textile.  By looking at these two pictures  I say no  it won't overtake China for a while. If you look at other East Asian countries  women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take off    in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with East Asia. India still has a long way to go to catch up with China. Then the issue is  what about the Chinese political system  You talk about human capital  you talk about education and public health. What about the political system  Isn't it true that the one party political system has facilitated economic growth in China  Actually  the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that. It depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system. Statically  China is a one party system  authoritarian    there's no question about it. Dynamically  it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic. When you explain change    for example  economic growth  economic growth is about change    when you explain change  you use other things that have changed to explain change  rather than using the constant to explain change. Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change  but a fixed effect only explains changes in interaction with the things that change. In terms of the political changes  they have introduced village elections. They have increased the security of proprietors. And they have increased the security with long term land leases. There are also financial reforms in rural China. There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China. To me  the pace of political changes is too slow  too gradual. And my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges  because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms. But nevertheless  the system has moved in a more liberal direction  moved in a more democratic direction. You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India. In fact  when India was growing at a Hindu rate of growth    about one percent  two percent a year    that was when India was least democratic. Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in     . The Indian government owned and operated all the TV stations. A little known fact about India in the     s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms  the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self rule  privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts. So the dynamic perspective fits both with China and in India in terms of the direction. Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster  One reason is they are always comparing India with China. But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth. If you are a NBA player and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan  you're going to look not so impressive. But that doesn't mean that you're a bad basketball player. Comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark. In fact  if you compare India with the average developing country  even before the more recent period of acceleration of Indian growth    now India is growing between eight and nine percent    even before this period  India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies. This is a very impressive record indeed. Let's think about the future  the dragon vis a vis the elephant. Which country has the growth momentum  China  I believe  still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals    mostly the social capital  the public health  the sense of egalitarianism that you don't find in India. But I believe that India has the momentum. It has the improving fundamentals. The government has invested in basic education  has invested in basic health. I believe the government should do more  but nevertheless  the direction it is moving in is the right direction. India has the right institutional conditions for economic growth  whereas China is still struggling with political reforms. I believe that the political reforms are a must for China to maintain its growth. And it's very important to have political reforms  to have widely shared benefits of economic growth. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not  but I'm an optimist. Hopefully  five years from now  I'm going to report to TEDGlobal that political reforms will happen in China. Thank you very much. Now this is a very un TED like thing to do  but let's kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor. Anonymous  Dear Fox News  it has come to our unfortunate attention that both the name and nature of Anonymous has been ravaged. We are everyone. We are no one. We are anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. We are but the base of chaos. Misha Glenny  Anonymous  ladies and gentlemen    a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in     . And they're pretty scary. You never know when they're going to attack next  who or what the consequences will be. But interestingly  they have a sense of humor. These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account to announce President Obama's assassination. Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at Fox.  What do we do now  Put on a black armband  or crack open the champagne   And of course  who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. being a victim of hacking for a change. Sometimes you turn on the news and you say   Is there anyone left to hack   Sony Playstation Network    done  the government of Turkey    tick  Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency    a breeze  the CIA    falling off a log. In fact  a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world  those that know they've been hacked  and those that don't. I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked. Is nothing sacred anymore  for heaven's sake  Anyway  this mysterious group Anonymous    and they would say this themselves    they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data. But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous    they are ideologically driven. They claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy. They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it  and that they  Anonymous  are the authentic voice of resistance    be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships  against global media corporations  or against intelligence agencies  or whoever it is. And their politics are not entirely unattractive. Okay  they're a little inchoate. There's a strong whiff of half baked anarchism about them. But one thing is true  we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the Internet. The Web links everything  and very soon it will mediate most human activity. Because the Internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom. Now this is a very complicated struggle. And unfortunately  for mortals like you and me  we probably can't understand it very well. Nonetheless  in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago  I decided I would try and do that. And I sort of get it. These were the various things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it. But in order to try and explain the whole thing  I would need another    minutes or so to do it  so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion  and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other  but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around. So there you are. And as you see  in the middle  there is our old friend  the hacker. The hacker is absolutely central to many of the political  social and economic issues affecting the Net. And so I thought to myself   Well  these are the guys who I want to talk to.  And what do you know  nobody else does talk to the hackers. They're completely anonymous  as it were. So despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions  hundreds of billions of dollars  into cybersecurity    for the most extraordinary technical solutions    no one wants to talk to these guys  the hackers  who are doing everything. Instead  we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions  which cost a huge amount of money. And so nothing is going into the hackers. Well  I say nothing  but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in Turin  Italy called the Hackers Profiling Project. And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics  into the abilities and the socialization of hackers. But because they're a U.N. operation  maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them. Because it's a U.N. operation  of course  it lacks funding. But I think they're doing very important work. Because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry  we have a definite lack of    call me old fashioned    human intelligence. Now  so far I've mentioned the hackers Anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group. Of course  the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals. But interestingly  Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain. But what about the real cybercriminals  Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about    years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website  which led to the industrialization of cybercrime. Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet. This is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net. Now CarderPlanet was very interesting. Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details  to exchange information about new malware that was out there. And remember  this is a time when we're seeing for the first time so called off the shelf malware. This is ready for use  out of the box stuff  which you can deploy even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker. And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals. And its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial  because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals. And that challenge is  How do you do business  how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal  It's axiomatic that they're dodgy  and they're going to want to try and rip you off. So the family  as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known  came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system. They appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser. The vendor  say  had stolen credit card details  the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them. The purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally  and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details. And the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked. And if they did  he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser. And it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web. And after that  it just went wild. We had a champagne decade for people who we know as Carders. Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we'll call RedBrigade    although that wasn't even his proper nickname    but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was. And he explained to me how in      and      he would go on sprees in New York  taking out         from an ATM here          from an ATM there  using cloned credit cards. He was making  on average a week              tax free of course. And he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper East side apartment at one point that he just didn't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression. But that's a slightly different story  which I won't go into now. Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade is that he wasn't an advanced hacker. He sort of understood the technology  and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a Carder  but he didn't spend his days and nights bent over a computer  eating pizza  drinking coke and that sort of thing. He was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life. And this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise. And often they're the most vulnerable element of all. And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research. Dimitry Golubov  aka SCRIPT    born in Odessa  Ukraine in     . Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the     s. This was a sink or swim environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive. As an accomplished computer user  what Dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the Worldwide Web. And he did a great job in it. You have to understand though that from his ninth birthday  the only environment he knew was gangsterism. He knew no other way of making a living and making money. Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam  aka JiLsi    founder of DarkMarket  born in Colombo  Sri Lanka. As an eight year old  he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city  looking for Tamils like Renu to murder. At     he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military  accused of being a terrorist  and his parents sent him on his own to Britain as a refugee seeking political asylum. At     with only little English and being bullied at school  he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability  but he was soon being seduced by people on the Internet. He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud  and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London in     . Matrix     who was an administrator at DarkMarket. Born in Southern Germany to a stable and well respected middle class family  his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking. And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated. His slide into criminality was incremental. And when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications  he was already in too deep. Max Vision  aka ICEMAN    mastermind of CardersMarket. Born in Meridian  Idaho. Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of Santa Clara  California in the late   s for private companies and voluntarily for the FBI. Now in the late     s  he discovered a vulnerability on all U.S. government networks  and he went in and patched it up    because this included nuclear research facilities    sparing the American government a huge security embarrassment. But also  because he was an inveterate hacker  he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl. But this was spotted by an eagle eye investigator  and he was convicted. At his open prison  he came under the influence of financial fraudsters  and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release. And this man with a planetary sized brain is now serving a    year sentence in California. Adewale Taiwo  aka FreddyBB    master bank account cracker from Abuja in Nigeria. He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup  bankfrauds yahoo.co.uk before arriving in Britain in      to take a Masters in chemical engineering at Manchester University. He impressed in the private sector  developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in     . And then finally  Cagatay Evyapan  aka Cha     one of the most remarkable hackers ever  from Ankara in Turkey. He combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal. One of the smartest people I've ever met. He also had the most effective virtual private network security arrangement the police have ever encountered amongst global cybercriminals. Now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments. They are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid teens. They are all people who demonstrate advanced ability in maths and the sciences. Remember that  when they developed those hacking skills  their moral compass had not yet developed. And most of them  with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha   they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world    only on the Web. And the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with Asperger's syndrome. Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron Cohen who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge. And he has done path breaking work on autism and confirmed  also for the authorities here  that Gary McKinnon    who is wanted by the United States for hacking into the Pentagon    suffers from Asperger's and a secondary condition of depression. And Baron Cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills  and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped. Now I think we're missing a trick here  because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail. And let me be blunt about this. In China  in Russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber offensive capabilities  this is exactly what they are doing. They are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities    are mobilizing them on behalf of the state. We need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people  because they are a remarkable breed. And if we rely  as we do at the moment  solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences  we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame. Thank you very much for listening. Chris Anderson  So your idea worth spreading is hire hackers. How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole  MG  I think to an extent  you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that. They're just relentless and obsessive about what they do. But all of the people who I've spoken to who have fallen foul of the law  they have all said   Please  please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry. We just never knew how to get there  what we were doing. We want to work with you.  Chris Anderson  Okay  well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha. My name is Kate Hartman. And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate. So I'm specifically interested in how we  as humans  relate to ourselves  each other and the world around us. So just to give you a bit of context  as June said  I'm an artist  a technologist and an educator. I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics. And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form. And so anytime I talk about what I do  I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter. And it's pretty simple. Everybody's got one    all of you. I can guarantee  everyone in this room  all of you over there  the people in the cushy seats  the people up top with the laptops    we all have bodies. Don't be ashamed. It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world. And so when working as an interaction designer  or as an artist who deals with participation    creating things that live on  in or around the human form    it's really a powerful space to work within. So within my own work  I use a broad range of materials and tools. So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing. And to tell you a bit about the things that I make  the easiest place to start the story is with a hat. And so it all started several years ago  late one night when I was sitting on the subway  riding home  and I was thinking. And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little. And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises    like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head    if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else. And so I went home  and I made a prototype of this hat. And I called it the Muttering Hat  because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you  but you could detach them and share them with somebody else. So I make other hats as well. This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat. It's fairly self explanatory. It physically carves out conversation space for one. And when you speak out loud  the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears. And so when I make these things  it's really not so much about the object itself  but rather the negative space around the object. So what happens when a person puts this thing on  What kind of an experience do they have  And how are they transformed by wearing it  So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves. So this particular device is called the Gut Listener. And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards. And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication. And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves. So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions. So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst. And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences. So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments. And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange  but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered. And in the end  some of these things just act as invitations. So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say. So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people  I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us. And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back  I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them. And I thought   Well  hey  Maybe if I want to better relate to walls  maybe I need to be more wall like myself.  So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack. And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me. And so jumping off of that  thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world  I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls    which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols. So when a plant is thirsty  it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter. And so this really shifts the human plant dynamic  because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time. And so kind of thinking about scale  my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers    of course. And so glaciers are these magnificent beings  and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them  but what I'm particularly interested in is in human glacier relations. Because there seems to be an issue. The glaciers are actually leaving us. They're both shrinking and retreating    and some of them have disappeared altogether. And so I actually live in Canada now  so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers. And this one's particularly interesting  because  of all the glaciers in North America  it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year. They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier. And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter. When I meet a glacier for the very first time  what do I do  There's no kind of social protocol for this. I really just don't even know how to say hello. Do I carve a message in the snow  Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes    ice cube Morse code. Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool  like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice. But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening  which is what we need in any good relationship. And I was really struck by how much it affected me. This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier. And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days  I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit. And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice. And once again  it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug. So  yea  this is actually just the beginning. These are initial musings for this project. And just as with the wall  how I wanted to be more wall like  with this project  I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace. And so my intent is to actually just take the next    years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines    artists  technologists  scientists    to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human glacier relations. So beyond that  in closing  I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation  and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy  but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen  I present to you the human genome. Chromosome one  top left. Bottom right are the sex chromosomes. Women have two copies of that big X chromosome  men have the X and  of course  that small copy of the Y. Sorry boys  but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different. So if you zoom in on this genome  then what you see  of course  is this double helix structure    the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters  or we call them bases  right  A  C  G and T. How many are there in the human genome  Three billion. Is that a big number  Well  everybody can throw around big numbers. But in fact  if I were to place one base on each pixel of this      by     resolution screen  we would need       screens to take a look at the genome. So it's really quite big. And perhaps because of its size  a group of people    all  by the way  with Y chromosomes    decided they would want to sequence it. And so    years  actually  and about four billion dollars later  the genome was sequenced and published. In       the final version was published  and they keep working on it. That was all done on a machine that looks like this. It costs about a dollar for each base    a very slow way of doing it. Well folks  I'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it. So now what we do is we take a genome  we make maybe    copies of it  we cut all those copies up into little    base reads  and then we sequence them  massively parallel. And then we bring that into software  and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is. And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like  the Human Genome Project    gigabases  right. One run on one of these machines      gigabases in a week. And that     is going to change to     this summer  and there's no sign of this pace slowing. So the price of a base  to sequence a base  has fallen     million times. That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in       waiting until       and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice. World population  PC placements  the archive of all the medical literature  Moore's law  the old way of sequencing  and here's all the new stuff. Guys  this is a log scale  you don't typically see lines that go up like that. So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like        to         human genomes this year. And we know this based on the machines that are being placed. This is expected to double  triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future. In fact  there's one lab in particular that represents    percent of all that capacity. It's called the Beijing Genomics Institute. The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon  by the way. What does this mean for medicine  So a woman is age   . She presents with stage   estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. She is treated with surgery  chemotherapy and radiation. She goes home. Two years later  she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer. Unfortunately  treated again with surgery and chemotherapy. She comes back three years later at age    with more ovarian cancer  more chemotherapy. Six months later  she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia. She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later. So first  the way in which this woman was treated  in as little as    years  will look like bloodletting. And it's because of people like my colleague  Rick Wilson  at the Genome Institute at Washington University  who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem. And he sequenced  he took skin cells  healthy skin  and cancerous bone marrow  and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks  no big deal. And then he compared those two genomes in software  and what he found  among other things  was a deletion  a       base deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called TP  . If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene  you're    percent likely to get cancer in your life. So unfortunately  this doesn't help this woman  but it does have severe  profound if you will  implications to her family. I mean  if they have the same mutation  and they get this genetic test  and they understand it  then they can go and get regular screens  and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life. Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins  diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two. Their mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe that the symptoms weren't matching up  and through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching  she was able to convince the medical community that  in fact  they had something else. What they had was dopa responsive dystonia. And so they were given L Dopa  and their symptoms did improve  but they weren't totally asymptomatic. Significant problems remained. Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery  who was lucky enough to be the CIO of a company called Life Technologies. They're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools. And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced. And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR  which is responsible for producing serotonin  among other things. So on top of L Dopa  they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug  and they're effectively normal now. Guys  this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing. And at the time    this was a few years ago    it cost         . Today it's        . Next year it's       . The year after it's       give or take a year. That's how fast this is moving. So here's little Nick    likes Batman and squirt guns. And it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim. And it's not that he's not eating  it's that when he eats  his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut. So a hundred surgeries later  he looks at his mom and says   Mom  please pray for me. I'm in so much pain.  His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on  but he says   Let's get this kid's genome sequenced.  And what they find is a single point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death. So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction to what's going on to the food essentially  and that's a natural reaction  which causes some programmed cell death. But the gene that regulates that down is broken. And so this informs  among other things  of course  a treatment for bone marrow transplant  which he undertakes. And after nine months of grueling recovery  he's now eating steak with A  sauce. The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today. Today  it's here. And what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five         years just because of this one thing. Which is a fantastic story  unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production. So it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn  wheat  soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought  of flood  of pests and pesticides. Now look  as long as we continue to increase the population  we're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods  and that's the only position that I'll take today. Unless there's anybody in the audience that would like to volunteer to stop eating  None  not one. This is a typewriter  a staple of every desktop for decades. And in fact  the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing. And then more general versions of word processors came about. But ultimately  it was a disruption on top of a disruption. It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything. And suddenly we had Netscape  and we had Yahoo and we had  indeed  the entire dotcom bubble. Not to worry though  that was quickly rescued by the iPod  Facebook and  indeed  angry birds. Look  this is where we are today. This is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are. So what I'd like you to consider is  What does it mean when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome  but they connect to genomes all across the planet  So I just recently had to buy life insurance. And I was required to answer  A. I have never had a genetic test  B. I've had one  here you go  and C. I've had one and I'm not telling. Thankfully  I was able to answer A  and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening. But what would have happened if I had said C  Consumer applications for genomics  they will flourish. Do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend  Sure. DNA sequencing on your iPhone  There's an app for that. Personalized genomic massage anyone  There's already a lab today that tests for allele     of the AVPR  gene  the so called cheating gene. So anybody who's here today with your significant other  just turn over to them and swab their mouth  send it to the lab and you'll know for sure. Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy  Now think of it  it's      and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns  but also her personal genome. And it looks really good. And then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same. Do you think that's not going to happen  Do you think it would have helped John McCain  How many people in the audience have the last name Resnick like me  Raise your hand. Anybody  Nobody. Typically  there's one or two. So my father's father was one of    Resnick brothers. They all hated each other. And they all moved to different parts of the planet. So it's likely that I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet  but I don't know. But imagine if my genome were deidentified  sitting in software  and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there  and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations. Not hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now. And so imagine one more thing  that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consents   Would you be willing to meet your third cousin   And if we both say yes  voila  Welcome to chromosomally LinkedIn. Now this is probably a good thing  right  You have bigger clan gatherings and so on. But maybe it's a bad thing as well. How many fathers in the room  Raise your hands. Okay  so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child. Look    These genomes  these    chromosomes  they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society    at least not yet. And like any new technology  it's really in humanity's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind  or not. And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you. Thank you. I want to say that really and truly  after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread  I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television. So most everyone watches TV. We like it. We like some parts of it. Here in America  people actually love TV. The average American watches TV for almost   hours a day. Okay  Now I happen to make my living these days in television  so for me  that's a good thing. But a lot of people don't love it so much. They  in fact  berate it. They call it stupid  and worse  believe me. My mother  growing up  she called it the  idiot box.  But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV  my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience. So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral  political  social and emotional need states of our nation    that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system. So all these things are uniquely human  and they all add up to our idea of conscience. Now today  we're not talking about good and bad TV. We're talking about popular TV. We're talking about top    Nielsen rated shows over the course of    years. How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about  which is the idea of our social  collective unconscious  but how do these top    Nielsen rated shows over    years reflect the idea of our social conscience  How does television evolve over time  and what does this say about our society  Now speaking of evolution  from basic biology  you probably remember that the animal kingdom  including humans  have four basic primal instincts. You have hunger  you have sex  you have power  and you have the urge for acquisitiveness. As humans  what's important to remember is that we've developed  we've evolved over time to temper  or tame  these basic animal instincts. We have the capacity to laugh and cry. We feel awe  we feel pity. That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom. The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained. We love to watch TV. This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom. Animals might love to play  but they don't love to watch. So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious. Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has  I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders. Is television literally functioning as our conscience  tempting us and rewarding us at the same time  So to begin to answer these questions  we did a research study. We went back    years to the           television season. We surveyed the top    Nielsen shows every year for    years    a thousand shows. We talked to over       individuals    almost          aged    to     and we asked them how they felt emotionally. How did you feel watching every single one of these shows  Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity  Did you feel outrage  Did you laugh  What did this mean for you  So to our global TED audiences  I want to say that this was a U.S. sample. But as you can see  these emotional need states are truly universal. And on a factual basis  over    percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows are exported around the world. So I really hope our global audiences can relate. Two acknowledgments before our first data slide  For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis  I thank legendary rabbi  Jack Stern. And for the way in which I'm going to present the data  I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling  who you may have just seen. Okay  here we go. So here you see  from      to       the    years of our study. Two things we're going to start with    the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state  which  for this purpose  we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me  that make me feel much more positive about the world. Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong. As we start  you see in      inspiration is holding steady. That's what we're watching TV for. Moral ambiguity starts to climb. Right at the end of the   s  moral ambiguity is going up  inspiration is kind of on the wane. Why  The Cuban Missile Crisis  JFK is shot  the Civil Rights movement  race riots  the Vietnam War  MLK is shot  Bobby Kennedy is shot  Watergate. Look what happens. In       inspiration plummets. Moral ambiguity takes off. They cross  but Ronald Reagan  a telegenic president  is in office. It's trying to recover. But look  it can't  AIDS  Iran Contra  the Challenger disaster  Chernobyl. Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from      for the next    years. Take a look at this. This chart is going to document a very similar trend. But in this case  we have comfort    the bubble in red    social commentary and irreverence in blue and green. Now this time on TV you have  Bonanza   don't forget  you have  Gunsmoke   you have  Andy Griffith   you have domestic shows all about comfort. This is rising. Comfort stays whole. Irreverence starts to rise. Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up. You get to       and look what happens. You have comfort  irreverence  and social commentary  not only battling it out in our society  but you literally have two establishment shows     Gunsmoke  and  Gomer Pyle     in      are the number two  and number three rated television shows. What's number one  The socially irreverent hippie show   Rowan and Martin's Laugh In.  They're all living together  right. Viewers had responded dramatically. Look at this green spike in      to a bellwether show. When you guys hear this industry term  a breakout hit  what does that mean  It means in the      television season  The  Smothers Brothers  came out of nowhere. This was the first show that allowed viewers to say   My God  I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War  about the presidency  through television   That's what we mean by a breakout show. So then  just like the last chart  look what happens. In       the dam bursts. The dam bursts. Comfort is no longer why we watch television. Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the   s. Now look at this. The   s means who  Norman Lear. You have  All in the Family    Sanford and Son   and the dominant show    in the top    for the entire   s     MAS H.  In the entire    years of television that we studied  seven of    shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War  five of the top    during the Nixon administration. Only one generation     years in  and we discovered  Wow  TV can do that  It can make me feel this  It can change us  So to this very  very savvy crowd  I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive. Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us    years ago. This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute  fantasy and imagination  which are shows defined as   takes me out of my everyday realm  and  makes me feel better.  That's mapped against the red dot  unemployment  which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic. You'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise  it maps to a spike in unemployment. Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed  No. In the   s you have the bellwether show  The Bionic Woman  that rocketed into the top    in       followed by the  Six Million Dollar Man  and  Charlie's Angels.  Another spike in the     s    another spike in shows about control and power. What were those shows  Glamorous and rich.  Dallas    Fantasy Island.  Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts  unemployment. So here you are  in my favorite chart  because this is our last    years. Whether or not you're in my business  you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV. Well  as we say in the business  X marks the spot. The   s    the big bubbles of humor    we're watching  Friends    Frasier    Cheers  and  Seinfeld.  Everything's good  low unemployment. But look  X marks the spot. In       the September      television season  humor succumbs to judgment once and for all. Why not  We had a      presidential election decided by the Supreme Court. We had the bursting of the tech bubble. We had     . Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon. Look what happens when we keep going. At the turn of the century  the Internet takes off  reality television has taken hold. What do people want in their TV then  I would have thought revenge or nostalgia. Give me some comfort  my world is falling apart. No  they want judgment. I can vote you off the island. I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing. I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired. That's all great  right  So as dramatically different as these television shows  pure entertainment  have been over the last    years    what did I start with     one basic instinct remains. We're animals  we need our moms. There has not been a decade of television without a definitive  dominant TV mom. The     s  June Cleever in the original comfort show   Leave it to Beaver.  Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the   s. Maude Findlay  the epitome of the irreverent     s  who tackled abortion  divorce  even menopause on TV. The     s  our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington. Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood. This era's mom  Bree Van de Kamp. Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience  sitting on television's shoulders  but I do know that I absolutely love this image. So to you all  the women of TEDWomen  the men of TEDWomen  the global audiences of TEDWomen  thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television. But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television. They give it life on television  for sure  but it's you as viewers  through your collective social consciences  that give it life  longevity  power or not. So thanks very much. Let's talk about billions. Let's talk about past and future billions. We know that about     billion people have ever lived. And we know that most of them are dead. And we also know that most of them live or lived in Asia. And we also know that most of them were or are very poor    did not live for very long. Let's talk about billions. Let's talk about the         billion dollars of wealth in the world today. We know that most of that wealth was made after the year     . And we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call Westerners  Europeans  North Americans  Australasians.    percent of the world's population today  Westerners own two thirds of its wealth. Economic historians call this  The Great Divergence.  And this slide here is the best simplification of the Great Divergence story I can offer you. It's basically two ratios of per capita GDP  per capita gross domestic product  so average income. One  the red line  is the ratio of British to Indian per capita income. And the blue line is the ratio of American to Chinese. And this chart goes back to     . And you can see here that there's an exponential Great Divergence. They start off pretty close together. In fact  in       the average Chinese was richer than the average North American. When you get to the     s  which is where this chart ends  the average Briton is more than    times richer than the average Indian. And that's allowing for differences in the cost of living. It's based on purchasing power parity. The average American is nearly    times richer than the average Chinese by the     s. So why  This wasn't just an economic story. If you take the    countries that went on to become the Western empires  in      they were really quite tiny    five percent of the world's land surface     percent of its population  maybe    percent of its income. By       these    countries  plus the United States  controlled vast global empires       percent of the world's territory  about the same percentage of its population  and a really huge  nearly three quarters share of global economic output. And notice  most of that went to the motherland  to the imperial metropoles  not to their colonial possessions. Now you can't just blame this on imperialism    though many people have tried to do so    for two reasons. One  empire was the least original thing that the West did after     . Everybody did empire. They beat preexisting Oriental empires like the Mughals and the Ottomans. So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation for the Great Divergence. In any case  as you may remember  the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the     s  some considerable time after decolonization. This is not a new question. Samuel Johnson  the great lexicographer   posed  it through his character Rasselas in his novel  Rasselas  Prince of Abissinia   published in     .  By what means are the Europeans thus powerful  or why  since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa for trade or conquest  cannot the Asiaticks and Africans invade their coasts  plant colonies in their ports  and give laws to their natural princes  The same wind that carries them back would bring us thither   That's a great question. And you know what  it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the Resterners    by the people in the rest of the world    like Ibrahim Muteferrika  an Ottoman official  the man who introduced printing  very belatedly  to the Ottoman Empire    who said in a book published in        Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with Muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies   Unlike Rasselas  Muteferrika had an answer to that question  which was correct. He said it was  because they have laws and rules invented by reason.  It's not geography. You may think we can explain the Great Divergence in terms of geography. We know that's wrong  because we conducted two great natural experiments in the   th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions. We took all the Germans  we divided them roughly in two  and we gave the ones in the East communism  and you see the result. Within an incredibly short period of time  people living in the German Democratic Republic produced Trabants  the Trabbi  one of the world's worst ever cars  while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz. If you still don't believe me  we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula. And we decided we'd take Koreans in roughly the same geographical place with  notice  the same basic traditional culture  and we divided them in two  and we gave the Northerners communism. And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany. Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly  but in almost every other respect  it's a huge divergence. Which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character  popular explanations for this kind of thing  are really significant. It's the ideas. It's the institutions. This must be true because a Scotsman said it. And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED. So let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman. He was Adam Smith    not Billy Connolly  not Sean Connery    though he is very smart indeed. Smith    and I want you to go and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile  it's a wonderful statue    Smith  in the  Wealth of Nations  published in         that's the most important thing that happened that year ... You bet. There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies  but ...  China seems to have been long stationary  and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much inferior to what  with other laws and institutions  the nature of its soil  climate  and situation might admit of.  That is so right and so cool. And he said it such a long time ago. But you know  this is a TED audience  and if I keep talking about institutions  you're going to turn off. So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand. Let's call them the killer apps. I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the West apart from the rest. And they're kind of like the apps on your phone  in the sense that they look quite simple. They're just icons  you click on them. But behind the icon  there's complex code. It's the same with institutions. There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence. One  competition. Two  the scientific revolution. Three  property rights. Four  modern medicine. Five  the consumer society. And six  the work ethic. You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at  or try and boil it down to just four  but you'll lose. Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this  synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process. Competition means  not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in       but within each of these units  there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns. The ancestor of the modern corporation  the City of London Corporation  existed in the   th century. Nothing like this existed in China  where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity  and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination  which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters and very complex Confucian essay writing. The scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world in a number of crucial ways  the most important being that  through the experimental method  it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before. Example  Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application of Newtonian physics to ballistics. Once you do that  your artillery becomes accurate. Think of what that means. That really was a killer application. Meanwhile  there's no scientific revolution anywhere else. The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe  but there's no scientific revolution there. In fact  they demolish Taqi al Din's observatory  because it's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of God. Property rights  It's not the democracy  folks  it's having the rule of law based on private property rights. That's what makes the difference between North America and South America. You could turn up in North America having signed a deed of indenture saying   I'll work for nothing for five years. You just have to feed me.  But at the end of it  you've got a hundred acres of land. That's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide. That's not possible in Latin America where land is held onto by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors. And you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between North and South. Most people in rural North America owned some land by     . Hardly anyone in South America did. That's another killer app. Modern medicine in the late   th century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people. And this was another killer app    the very opposite of a killer  because it doubled  and then more than doubled  human life expectancy. It even did that in the European empires. Even in places like Senegal  beginning in the early   th century  there were major breakthroughs in public health  and life expectancy began to rise. It doesn't rise any faster after these countries become independent. The empires weren't all bad. The consumer society is what you need for the Industrial Revolution to have a point. You need people to want to wear tons of clothes. You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month  I guarantee it. That's the consumer society  and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself. Japan was the first non Western society to embrace it. The alternative  which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi  was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent. Very few Indians today wish that India had gone down Mahatma Gandhi's road. Finally  the work ethic. Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant. He was wrong. Any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work. We know this because today the work ethic is no longer a Protestant  Western phenomenon. In fact  the West has lost its work ethic. Today  the average Korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average German    a thousand. And this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon  and that is the end of the Great Divergence. Who's got the work ethic now  Take a look at mathematical attainment by    year olds. At the top of the international league table according to the latest PISA study  is the Shanghai district of China. The gap between Shanghai and the United Kingdom and the United States is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S. and Albania and Tunisia. You probably assume that because the iPhone was designed in California but assembled in China that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation. You're wrong. In terms of patents  there's no question that the East is ahead. Not only has Japan been ahead for some time  South Korea has gone into third place  and China is just about to overtake Germany. Why  Because the killer apps can be downloaded. It's open source. Any society can adopt these institutions  and when they do  they achieve what the West achieved after         only faster. This is the Great Reconvergence  and it's the biggest story of your lifetime. Because it's on your watch that this is happening. It's our generation that is witnessing the end of Western predominance. The average American used to be more than    times richer than the average Chinese. Now it's just five times  and soon it will be  .  times. So I want to end with three questions for the future billions  just ahead of       when the United States will lose its place as number one economy to China. The first is  can you delete these apps  and are we in the process of doing so in the Western world  The second question is  does the sequencing of the download matter  And could Africa get that sequencing wrong  One obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure private property rights. Warning  that may not work. And third  can China do without killer app number three  That's the one that John Locke systematized when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law. That's the basis for the Western model of representative government. Now this picture shows the demolition of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio in Shanghai earlier this year. He's now free again  having been detained  as you know  for some time. But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt. Winston Churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of     . And I think these words really nail it   It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians. It means that violence  the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs  the conditions of camps and warfare  of riot and tyranny  give place to parliaments where laws are made  and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained. That is civilization    and in its soil grow continually freedom  comfort and culture   what all TEDsters care about most.  When civilization reigns in any country  a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people.  That's so true. I don't think the decline of Western civilization is inevitable  because I don't think history operates in this kind of life cycle model  beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's  Course of Empire  paintings. That's not the way history works. That's not the way the West rose  and I don't think it's the way the West will fall. The West may collapse very suddenly. Complex civilizations do that  because they operate  most of the time  on the edge of chaos. That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations. No  we may hang on  despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated  despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo. But one thing is for sure  the Great Divergence is over  folks. Thanks very much. Bruno Giussani  Niall  I am just curious about your take on the other region of the world that's booming  which is Latin America. What's your view on that  Niall Ferguson  Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East  I'm talking about the rise of the Rest  and that includes South America. I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard   Hey  is South America part of the West   He was an expert in Latin American history. He said   I don't know  I'll have to think about that.  That tells you something really important. I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular  but also Chile  which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life  there's a very bright future indeed. So my story really is as much about that convergence in the Americas as it's a convergence story in Eurasia. BG  And there is this impression that North America and Europe are not really paying attention to these trends. Mostly they're worried about each other. The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow. The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow. And that's all we seem to be caring about recently. NF  I think the fiscal crisis that we see in the developed World right now    both sides of the Atlantic    is essentially the same thing taking different forms in terms of political culture. And it's a crisis that has its structural facet    it's partly to do with demographics. But it's also  of course  to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage  excessive borrowing in the private sector. That crisis  which has been the focus of so much attention  including by me  I think is an epiphenomenon. The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon  which has just accelerated this huge shift  which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy. I think that's its real importance. BG  Niall  thank you.  NF  Thank you very much  Bruno.  Erez Lieberman Aiden  Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true. So we assembled a team of experts  spanning Harvard  MIT  The American Heritage Dictionary  The Encyclopedia Britannica and even our proud sponsors  the Google. And we cogitated about this for about four years. And we came to a startling conclusion. Ladies and gentlemen  a picture is not worth a thousand words. In fact  we found some pictures that are worth     billion words. Jean Baptiste Michel  So how did we get to this conclusion  So Erez and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history  change over time. So many books actually have been written over the years. So we were thinking  well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books. Now of course  if there's a scale for how awesome that is  that has to rank extremely  extremely high. Now the problem is there's an X axis for that  which is the practical axis. This is very  very low. Now people tend to use an alternative approach  which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully. This is extremely practical  but not so awesome. What you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space. So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach. They have digitized millions of books. So what that means is  one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button. That's very practical and extremely awesome. ELA  Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from. Since time immemorial  there have been authors. These authors have been striving to write books. And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago. Since then  the authors have won on     million distinct occasions  publishing books. Now if those books are not lost to history  then they are somewhere in a library  and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google  which has scanned    million books to date. Now when Google digitizes a book  they put it into a really nice format. Now we've got the data  plus we have metadata. We have information about things like where was it published  who was the author  when was it published. And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data. What we're left with is a collection of five million books      billion words  a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome    a text which  when written out  would stretch from here to the Moon and back    times over    a veritable shard of our cultural genome. Of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ... was what any self respecting researchers would have done. We took a page out of XKCD  and we said   Stand back. We're going to try science.  JM  Now of course  we were thinking  well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it. Now we're thinking  what data can we release  Well of course  you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books. Now Google  and Jon Orwant in particular  told us a little equation that we should learn. So you have five million  that is  five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit. So  although that would be really  really awesome  again  that's extremely  extremely impractical. Now again  we kind of caved in  and we did the very practical approach  which was a bit less awesome. We said  well instead of releasing the full text  we're going to release statistics about the books. So take for instance  A gleam of happiness.  It's four words  we call that a four gram. We're going to tell you how many times a particular four gram appeared in books in                   all the way up to     . That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time. We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books  and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing. ELA  So those two billion lines  we call them two billion n grams. What do they tell us  Well the individual n grams measure cultural trends. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose that I am thriving  then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did. And so I might say   Yesterday  I throve.  Alternatively  I could say   Yesterday  I thrived.  Well which one should I use  How to know  As of about six months ago  the state of the art in this field is that you would  for instance  go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair  and you'd say   Steve  you're an expert on the irregular verbs. What should I do   And he'd tell you   Well most people say thrived  but some people say throve.  And you also knew  more or less  that if you were to go back in time     years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair   Tom  what should I say   He'd say   Well  in my day  most people throve  but some thrived.  So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data. Two rows from this table of two billion entries. What you're seeing is year by year frequency of  thrived  and  throve  over time. Now this is just two out of two billion rows. So the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide. JM  Now there are many other pictures that are worth     billion words. For instance  this one. If you just take influenza  you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe. ELA  If you were not yet convinced  sea levels are rising  so is atmospheric CO  and global temperature. JM  You might also want to have a look at this particular n gram  and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead  although you might agree that he might need a better publicist. ELA  You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing. For instance  let me tell you the history of the year     . Pretty much for the vast majority of history  no one gave a damn about     . In       in       in       no one cared. Through the   s and   s  no one cared. Suddenly  in the mid   s  there started to be a buzz. People realized that      was going to happen  and it could be big. But nothing got people interested in      like the year     . People were walking around obsessed. They couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in       all the things they were planning to do in       all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in     . In fact       was so fascinating that for years thereafter  people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened  in '    '    '  . Finally in       someone woke up and realized that      had gotten somewhat pass . And just like that  the bubble burst. And the story of      is the story of every year that we have on record  with a little twist  because now we've got these nice charts. And because we have these nice charts  we can measure things. We can say   Well how fast does the bubble burst   And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely. Equations were derived  graphs were produced  and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year. We are losing interest in the past more rapidly. JM  Now a little piece of career advice. So for those of you who seek to be famous  we can learn from the    most famous political figures  authors  actors and so on. So if you want to become famous early on  you should be an actor  because then fame starts rising by the end of your   s    you're still young  it's really great. Now if you can wait a little bit  you should be an author  because then you rise to very great heights  like Mark Twain  for instance  extremely famous. But if you want to reach the very top  you should delay gratification and  of course  become a politician. So here you will become famous by the end of your   s  and become very  very famous afterward. So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older. Like for instance  biologists and physics tend to be almost as famous as actors. One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician. If you do that  you might think   Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my   s.  But guess what  nobody will really care. ELA  There are more sobering notes among the n grams. For instance  here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall  an artist born in     . And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person. He gets more and more and more famous  except if you look in German. If you look in German  you see something completely bizarre  something you pretty much never see  which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets  going through a nadir between      and       before rebounding afterward. And of course  what we're seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany. Now these signals are actually so strong that we don't need to know that someone was censored. We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing. Here's a simple way to do it. Well  a reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after. So that's sort of what we expect. And we compare that to the fame that we observe. And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index. If the suppression index is very  very  very small  then you very well might be being suppressed. If it's very large  maybe you're benefiting from propaganda. JM  Now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations. So for instance  here    this suppression index is for       people picked in English books where there's no known suppression    it would be like this  basically tightly centered on one. What you expect is basically what you observe. This is distribution as seen in Germany    very different  it's shifted to the left. People talked about it twice less as it should have been. But much more importantly  the distribution is much wider. There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about    times fewer than they should have been. But then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda. This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record. ELA  So culturomics is what we call this method. It's kind of like genomics. Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome. Culturomics is similar. It's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture. Here  instead of through the lens of a genome  through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record. The great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it. Why can everyone do it  Everyone can do it because three guys  Jon Orwant  Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google  saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer  and they said   This is so fun. We have to make this available for people.  So in two weeks flat    the two weeks before our paper came out    they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public. And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its n gram immediately    also browse examples of all the various books in which your n gram appears. JM  Now this was used over a million times on the first day  and this is really the best of all the queries. So people want to be their best  put their best foot forward. But it turns out in the   th century  people didn't really care about that at all. They didn't want to be their best  they wanted to be their beft. So what happened is  of course  this is just a mistake. It's not that strove for mediocrity  it's just that the S used to be written differently  kind of like an F. Now of course  Google didn't pick this up at the time  so we reported this in the science article that we wrote. But it turns out this is just a reminder that  although this is a lot of fun  when you interpret these graphs  you have to be very careful  and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences. ELA  People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes. Actually  we're not going to have to talk  we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent. This person was interested in the history of frustration. There's various types of frustration. If you stub your toe  that's a one A  argh.  If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass  that's an eight A  aaaaaaaargh.  This person studies all the  arghs   from one through eight A's. And it turns out that the less frequent  arghs  are  of course  the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating    except  oddly  in the early   s. We think that might have something to do with Reagan. JM  There are many usages of this data  but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized. Google has started to digitize    million books. That's    percent of all the books that have ever been published. It's a sizable chunk of human culture. There's much more in culture  there's manuscripts  there newspapers  there's things that are not text  like art and paintings. These all happen to be on our computers  on computers across the world. And when that happens  that will transform the way we have to understand our past  our present and human culture. Thank you very much. I am a reformed marketer  and I now work in international development. In October  I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo  which is the  second  largest country in Africa. In fact  it's as large as Western Europe  but it only has     miles of paved roads. The DRC is a dangerous place. In the past    years  five million people have died due to a war in the east. But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC. There are many health issues as well. In fact  the HIV prevalence rate is  .  percent among adults. This might not sound like a large number  but in a country with    million people  it means there are         that are infected. And due to the poor infrastructure  only    percent of those are receiving the life saving drugs that they need. Which is why  in part  donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost. And so while I was in the DRC  I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms  including Damien. Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa. It's a hotel that's only open until midnight  so it's not a place that you stay. But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come. Now Damien knows all about condoms  but he doesn't sell them. He said there's just not in demand. It's not surprising  because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms. Joseph and Christine  who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms  said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost  and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them  their customers don't buy the branded versions. They like the generics. And as a marketer  I found that curious. And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like. And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms  fear  financing and fidelity. They name the condoms things like Vive   to live  or Trust. They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV  put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them  show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently. Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom. What is it that you think about just before you get a condom  Sex  And the private companies that sell condoms in these places  they understand this. Their marketing is slightly different. The name might not be much different  but the imagery sure is. Some brands are aspirational  and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing  understanding who's the audience. And for donor agencies  unfortunately  the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working  in . It's people back home  people that support their work  people like these. But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV  we need to think about the customer  the people whose behavior needs to change    the couples  the young women  the young men    whose lives depend on it. And so the lesson is this  it doesn't really matter what you're selling  you just have to think about who is your customer  and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior. It might just save their lives. Thank you. Everyone's familiar with cancer  but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease. The Tasmanian devil has shown us that  not only can cancer be a contagious disease  but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction. So first of all  what is a Tasmanian devil  Many of you might be familiar with Taz  the cartoon character  the one that spins around and around and around. But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil  and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial. A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo. The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes. The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger  and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.  The  Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania  which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia. And despite their ferocious appearance  Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals. In fact  growing up in Tasmania  it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a Tasmanian devil in the wild. But the Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline. And in fact  there's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within    to    years. And the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease  a contagious cancer. The story begins in      when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face. At the time  this was thought to be a one off. Animals  just like humans  sometimes get strange tumors. However  we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease  which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania. The disease was first sighted in the northeast of Tasmania in      and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave. Now there's only a small part of the population  which remains unaffected. This disease appears first as tumors  usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors  such as these ones here. And the next image I'm going to show is quite gruesome. But inevitably  these tumors progress towards being enormous  ulcerating tumors like this one here. This one in particular sticks in my mind  because this is the first case of this disease that I saw myself. And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating  foul smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw. She hadn't eaten for days. Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms. Her body was riddled with secondary tumors. And yet  she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils in her pouch. Of course  they died along with the mother. They were too young to survive without their mother. In fact  in the area where she comes from  more than    percent of the Tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease. Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer  this infectious cancer  that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population. And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women  which is spread by a virus  and to the AIDS epidemic  which is associated with a number of different types of cancer. All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus. However  we now know    and I'll tell you right now    that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus. In fact  the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister  and something that we hadn't really thought of before. But in order for me to explain what that is  I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself. Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year. One in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives. I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only   . Cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself. Paradoxically  once established  natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer. Natural selection is survival of the fittest. And when you have a population of fast dividing cancer cells  if one of them acquires new mutations  which allow them to grow more quickly  acquire nutrients more successfully  invade the body  they'll be selected for by evolution. That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat. It evolves. Throw a drug at it  and resistant cells will grow back. An amazing fact is that  given the right environment and the right nutrients  a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever. However cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies  and its continued growth  its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues  leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself. So cancer could be thought of as a strange  short lived  self destructive life form    an evolutionary dead end. But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation. And the answer came from studying the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA. This was work from many people  but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that I did a few years ago. The next slide is going to be gruesome. This is Jonas. He's a Tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face. And being a geneticist  I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations. So I took this opportunity to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body. I took these back to the lab. I extracted DNA from them. And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA  and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor to that of the rest of his body  I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile. In fact  Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you. What this told us was that Jonas' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body. In fact  more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil    and Jonas was clearly a male. So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on Jonas' face  Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania. We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA. Think about that for a minute. That means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil  that have broken free of that first devil's body and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population. But how can a cancer spread in a population  Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild. They tend to bite each other  often quite ferociously and usually on the face. We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor  get into the saliva. When the devil bites another devil  it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil  so the tumor continues to grow. So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer. It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it. It spreads through the population  has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system  and it's the only cancer that we know of that's threatening an entire species with extinction. But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils  why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans  Well the answer is  it has. This is Kimbo. He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya. Last year  his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region. She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting. And if you're squeamish  please look away now. He discovered this  a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kimbo's penis. The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor  a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs. And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells  so is this dog cancer. But this dog cancer is quite remarkable  because it spread all around the world. And in fact  these same cells that are affecting Kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in New York City  in mountain villages in the Himalayas and in Outback Australia. We also believe this cancer might be very old. In fact  genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old  which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals. This cancer is remarkable. It's the oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of. It's a living relic of the distant past. So we've seen that this can happen in animals. Could cancers be contagious between people  Well this is a question which fascinated Chester Southam  a cancer doctor in the     s. Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else. And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in      injecting cancer into a volunteer  who in this case was an inmate in Ohio State Penitentiary. Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells. But a small number of them did  and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill    whose immune systems were probably compromised. What this tells us  ethical issues aside  is that ... it's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people. However  under some circumstances  it can happen. And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future. So just finally  cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments. But that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer. In fact  I believe  given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth  we can defeat cancer. My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer. Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer. Thank you. So I just want to tell you my story. I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace. And naturally  I encounter a lot of resistance  because it's considered to be anti intellectual and counter to serious learning. But I have a problem with that belief  because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems. So I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is. So I discovered some very interesting things. For example  there's no such thing as a flattering definition of a doodle. In the   th century  a doodle was a simpleton or a fool    as in Yankee Doodle. In the   th century  it became a verb  and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone. In the   th century  it was a corrupt politician. And today  we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition  at least to me  which is the following  To doodle officially means to dawdle  to dilly dally  to monkey around  to make meaningless marks  to do something of little value  substance or import  and    my personal favorite    to do nothing. No wonder people are averse to doodling at work. Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work  it's totally inappropriate. Additionally  I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them  of course  for doodling in classrooms. And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom. There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something. And unfortunately  the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene    of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like    they typically use words like  discovered  or  caught  or  found out   as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed. And additionally  there is a psychological aversion to doodling    thank you  Freud. In the     s  Freud told us all that you could analyze people's psyches based on their doodles. This is not accurate  but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos Forum in       when his doodles were  of course   discovered  and he was labeled the following things. Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle. And Bill  if you're here  nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal. But that does contribute to people not wanting to share their doodles. And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe. I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling. And I'm not comfortable with that. And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst  I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth. And here's the truth  doodling is an incredibly powerful tool  and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re learn. So here's a new definition for doodling. And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary  because I want to talk to you later. Here's the real definition  Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think. That is why millions of people doodle. Here's another interesting truth about the doodle  People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non doodling counterparts. We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus  but in reality  it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus. Additionally  it has a profound effect on creative problem solving and deep information processing. There are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions. They are visual  auditory  reading and writing and kinesthetic. Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it  we have to engage at least two of those modalities  or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience. The incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience. That is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing. This is so nerdy  but this made me cry when I discovered this. So they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children  and they found that  across space and time  all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow. In other words  they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order. And I think that is incredible. I think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct. And finally  a lot a people aren't privy to this  but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets. This is but one  this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi. So here is my point  Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room. On the contrary  doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high. And I will go you one further. Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form  it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy. My friends  the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought. In reality  it is one of its greatest allies. Thank you. A few months ago  a    year old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live  and she was brought in confused. Her blood pressure was an alarming     over    . Within a few minutes  she went into cardiac collapse. She was resuscitated  stabilized  whisked over to a CAT scan suite right next to the emergency room  because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung. And the CAT scan revealed no blood clots in the lung  but it showed bilateral  visible  palpable breast masses  breast tumors  that had metastasized widely all over the body. And the real tragedy was  if you look through her records  she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years. Four or five opportunities to see the breast masses  touch the breast mass  intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her. Ladies and gentlemen  that is not an unusual story. Unfortunately  it happens all the time. I joke  but I only half joke  that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb  no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan  MRI or orthopedic consult. I am not a Luddite. I teach at Stanford. I'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology. But I'd like to make the case to you in the next    minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam  when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient  we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable  early stage  but we're losing much more than that. We're losing a ritual. We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative  transcendent  and is at the heart of the patient physician relationship. This may actually be heresy to say this at TED  but I'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation  I think  in medicine to come in the next    years  and that is the power of the human hand    to touch  to comfort  to diagnose and to bring about treatment. I'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize. This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Since we're in Edinburgh  I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle. You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh  and his character  Sherlock Holmes  was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell. Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts. And Conan Doyle  writing about Bell  described the following exchange between Bell and his students. So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department  students all around him  patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in. And a woman comes in with a child  and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange. The woman says   Good Morning.  Bell says   What sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from Burntisland   She says   It was good.  And he says   What did you do with the other child   She says   I left him with my sister at Leith.  And he says   And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row to get here to the infirmary   She says   I did.  And he says   Would you still be working at the linoleum factory   And she says   I am.  And Bell then goes on to explain to the students. He says   You see  when she said  'Good morning ' I picked up her Fife accent. And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland. And so she must have taken the ferry over. You notice that the coat she's carrying is too small for the child who is with her  and therefore  she started out the journey with two children  but dropped one off along the way. You notice the clay on the soles of her feet. Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh  except in the botanical gardens. And therefore  she took a short cut down Inverleith Row to arrive here. And finally  she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand  a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland.  And when Bell actually strips the patient  begins to examine the patient  you can only imagine how much more he would discern. And as a teacher of medicine  as a student myself  I was so inspired by that story. But you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way  using our senses  is quite recent. The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger who  in the late     s  discovered percussion. And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger was the son of an innkeeper. And his father used to go down into the basement to tap on the sides of casks of wine to determine how much wine was left and whether to reorder. And so when Auenbrugger became a physician  he began to do the same thing. He began to tap on the chests of his patients  on their abdomens. And basically everything we know about percussion  which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day    organ enlargement  fluid around the heart  fluid in the lungs  abdominal changes    all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript  Inventum Novum    New Invention   which would have disappeared into obscurity  except for the fact that this physician  Corvisart  a famous French physician    famous only because he was physician to this gentleman    Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work. And it was followed a year or two later by Laennec discovering the stethoscope. Laennec  it is said  was walking in the streets of Paris and saw two children playing with a stick. One was scratching at the end of the stick  another child listened at the other end. And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called  the cylinder.  Later he renamed it the stethoscope. And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born. So within a few years  in the late     s  early     s  all of a sudden  the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis. If you'll recall  prior to that time  no matter what ailed you  you went to see the barber surgeon who wound up cupping you  bleeding you  purging you. And  oh yes  if you wanted  he would give you a haircut    short on the sides  long in the back    and pull your tooth while he was at it. He made no attempt at diagnosis. In fact  some of you might well know that the barber pole  the red and white stripes  represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon  and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected. But the arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change  a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body. And this particular painting  I think  represents the pinnacle  the peak  of that clinical era. This is a very famous painting   The Doctor  by Luke Fildes. Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate  who then established the Tate Gallery. And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting of social importance. And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic. Fildes' oldest son  Philip  died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve after a brief illness. And Fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two  three nights  that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time    almost a tribute to this physician. And hence the painting  The Doctor   a very famous painting. It's been on calendars  postage stamps in many different countries. I've often wondered  what would Fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era  in the year       Would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient  I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer. I call it the iPatient. The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America. The real patient often wonders  where is everyone  When are they going to come by and explain things to me  Who's in charge  There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care. I want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like when I was in training. The focus was around the patient. We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge. Too often these days  rounds look very much like this  where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient. The discussion is all about images on the computer  data. And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient. Now I've been influenced in this thinking by two anecdotes that I want to share with you. One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer  had a small breast cancer detected    had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived. This is when I was in Texas. And she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care. And she found the place and decided to go there  went there. Which is why I was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town  getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist. And I pressed her  and I asked her   Why did you come back and get your care here   And she was reluctant to tell me. She said   The cancer center was wonderful. It had a beautiful facility  giant atrium  valet parking  a piano that played itself  a concierge that took you around from here to there. But   she said   but they did not touch my breasts.  Now you and I could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts. They had her scanned inside out. They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level  they had no need to touch her breasts. But to her  it mattered deeply. It was enough for her to make the decision to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist who  every time she went  examined both breasts including the axillary tail  examined her axilla carefully  examined her cervical region  her inguinal region  did a thorough exam. And to her  that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed. I was very influenced by that anecdote. I was also influenced by another experience that I had  again  when I was in Texas  before I moved to Stanford. I had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue. This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy. I say that because these are difficult patients. They have often been rejected by their families  have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who's about to disappoint them. And I learned very early on with my first patient that I could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of    minutes. There was just no way. And if I tried  I'd disappoint them. And so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit  and I tried not to interrupt them. We know the average American physician interrupts their patient in    seconds. And if I ever get to heaven  it will be because I held my piece for    minutes and did not interrupt my patient. I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence  and when the patient came for the physical  I was able to do a thorough physical  because I had nothing else to do. I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam  but because the whole visit was now about the physical  I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam. And I remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit. And I began my ritual. I always begin with the pulse  then I examine the hands  then I look at the nail beds  then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node  and I was into my ritual. And when my ritual began  this very voluble patient began to quiet down. And I remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and I had slipped back into a primitive ritual in which I had a role and the patient had a role. And when I was done  the patient said to me with some awe   I have never been examined like this before.  Now if that were true  it's a true condemnation of our health care system  because they had been seen in other places. I then proceeded to tell the patient  once the patient was dressed  the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions  which is   This is not in your head. This is real. The good news  it's not cancer  it's not tuberculosis  it's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection. The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this  but here's what you should do  here's what we should do.  And I would lay out all the standard treatment options that the patient had heard elsewhere. And I always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor  the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness  it was because I had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination. Something of importance had transpired in the exchange. I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story. And they immediately said to me   Well you are describing a classic ritual.  And they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation. We marry  for example  with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss. I'm not sure why you're laughing. That was the original intent  was it not  We signal transitions of power with rituals. We signal the passage of a life with rituals. Rituals are terribly important. They're all about transformation. Well I would submit to you that the ritual of one individual coming to another and telling them things that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi  and then  incredibly on top of that  disrobing and allowing touch    I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance. And if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient  by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown  by not doing a complete exam  you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient physician relationship. I am a writer  and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote that has to do very much with this scene. I'm an infectious disease physician  and in the early days of HIV  before we had our medications  I presided over so many scenes like this. I remember  every time I went to a patient's deathbed  whether in the hospital or at home  I remember my sense of failure    the feeling of I don't know what I have to say  I don't know what I can say  I don't know what I'm supposed to do. And out of that sense of failure  I remember  I would always examine the patient. I would pull down the eyelids. I would look at the tongue. I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart. I would feel the abdomen. I remember so many patients  their names still vivid on my tongue  their faces still so clear. I remember so many huge  hollowed out  haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual. And then the next day  I would come  and I would do it again. And I wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient.  I recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin  unable to speak  his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications. When he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth  his hands moved as if in slow motion. And as I wondered what he was up to  his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt  fumbling with his buttons. I realized that he was wanting to expose his wicker basket chest to me. It was an offering  an invitation. I did not decline. I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest. I think he surely must have known by then that it was vital for me just as it was necessary for him. Neither of us could skip this ritual  which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung  or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure. No  this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients. Although  God knows  of late  in our hubris  we seem to have drifted away. We seem to have forgotten    as though  with the explosion of knowledge  the whole human genome mapped out at our feet  we are lulled into inattention  forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician  necessary for the patient    forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient. And the message  which I didn't fully understand then  even as I delivered it  and which I understand better now is this  I will always  always  always be there. I will see you through this. I will never abandon you. I will be with you through the end.  Thank you very much. What I want to talk about today is one idea. It's an idea for a new kind of school  which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work. And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon. Where it comes from is an organization called the Young Foundation  which  over many decades  has come up with many innovations in education  like the Open University and things like Extended Schools  Schools for Social Entrepreneurs  Summer Universities and the School of Everything. And about five years ago  we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the U.K. And we felt the most important priority was to bring together two sets of problems. One was large numbers of bored teenagers who just didn't like school  couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school and future jobs. And employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work  didn't have the right attitudes and experience. And so we try to ask  What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in  not fighting to stay out  And after hundreds of conversations with teenagers and teachers and parents and employers and schools from Paraguay to Australia  and looking at some of the academic research  which showed the importance of what's now called non cognitive skills    the skills of motivation  resilience    and that these are as important as the cognitive skills    formal academic skills    we came up with an answer  a very simple answer in a way  which we called the Studio School. And we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance where work and learning are integrated. You work by learning  and you learn by working. And the design we came up with had the following characteristics. First of all  we wanted small schools    about          pupils       to    year olds  and critically  about    percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms  but through real life  practical projects  working on commission to businesses  NGO's and others. That every pupil would have a coach  as well as teachers  who would have timetables much more like a work environment in a business. And all of this will be done within the public system  funded by public money  but independently run. And all at no extra cost  no selection  and allowing the pupils the route into university  even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have manual jobs as well. Underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things  they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real    all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does. Now that was a nice idea  so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase. We tried it out  first in Luton    famous for its airport and not much else  I fear    and in Blackpool    famous for its beaches and leisure. And what we found    and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then improved them    but we found that the young people loved it. They found it much more motivational  much more exciting than traditional education. And perhaps most important of all  two years later when the exam results came through  the pupils who had been put on these field trials who were in the lowest performing groups had jumped right to the top    in fact  pretty much at the top decile of performance in terms of GCSE's  which is the British marking system. Now not surprisingly  that influenced some people to think we were onto something. The minister of education down south in London described himself as a  big fan.  And the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real life work today. And indeed  the head of the Chambers of Commerce is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust and helping it  not just with big businesses  but small businesses all over the country. We started with two schools. That's grown this year to about   . And next year  we're expecting about    schools open across England  and another    areas want to have their own schools opening    a pretty rapid spread of this idea. Interestingly  it's happened almost entirely without media coverage. It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it. It spread almost entirely through word of mouth  virally  across teachers  parents  people involved in education. And it spread because of the power of an idea    so the very  very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal  things like working in teams  doing practical projects  and putting them right at the heart of learning  rather than on the edges. Now there's a whole set of new schools opening up this autumn. This is one from Yorkshire where  in fact  my nephew  I hope  will be able to attend it. And this one is focused on creative and media industries. Other ones have a focus on health care  tourism  engineering and other fields. We think we're onto something. It's not perfect yet  but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands  possibly millions  of teenagers who are really bored by schooling. It doesn't animate them. They're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour. They want to do things  they want to get their hands dirty  they want education to be for real. And my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us. We feel we're on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the Studio School idea into something which is present  not as a universal answer for every child  but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world. And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen. Thank you very much. I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana  West Africa. Ghana felt safe to me as a child. I was free  I was happy. The early   s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana. But then by the end of the decade  the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement. In       I witnessed my first military coup. We the children had gathered at a friend's house. It was a dimly lit shack. There was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background  and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole. The firing squad aimed  fired    the general was dead. Now this was being broadcast live. And shortly after  we left the country  and we returned to Switzerland. Now Europe came as a shock to me  and I think I started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in. I wanted to blend in like a chameleon. I think it was a tactic of survival. And it worked  or so I believed. So here I was in      wondering where I was in my life. And I felt I was being typecast as an actor. I was always playing the exotic African. I was playing the violent African  the African terrorist. And I was thinking  how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself  And I had become ashamed of the other  the African in me. And fortunately I decided in      to return to Ghana  after    years of absence. I wanted to document on film the      presidential elections. And there  I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood. And before I even knew it  I was suddenly on a stage surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political rally. And I realized that  when I'd left the country  free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream. And now that I'd returned  that dream had become reality  though a fragile reality. And I was thinking  was Ghana searching for its identity like I was looking for my identity  Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me  And it was as if through the standards of my Western life  I hadn't lived up to my full potential. I mean  nor had Ghana  even though we had been trying very hard. Now in       Ghana was the first sub Saharan country to gain its independence. In the late   s  Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP. I mean  today  Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not. But maybe it was time to prove to myself  yes  it's important to understand the past  it is important to look at it in a different light  but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present. So here I was  December  th      . The polling stations opened to the voters at      AM  but voters  eager to take their own political fate into their hands  were starting to line up at      AM in the morning. And they had traveled from near  they had traveled from far  because they wanted to make their voices heard. And I asked one of the voters  I said   Whom are you going to vote for   And he said   I'm sorry  I can't tell you.  He said that his vote was in his heart. And I understood  this was their election  and they weren't going to let anyone take it away from them. Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner    so nobody had achieved the absolute majority    so voting went into a second round three weeks later. The candidates were back on the road  they were campaigning. The rhetoric of the candidates  of course  changed. The heat was on. And then the cliche came to haunt us. There were claims of intimidation at the polling stations  of ballot boxes being stolen. Inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control. We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets. People were being beaten brutally. The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling. It was complete chaos. And my heart sank  because I thought  here we are again. Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself. And not only that  I am documenting it    documenting my own cultural shortcomings. So when the echo of the gunshots had lingered  it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob  and I didn't believe what I was hearing. They were chanting   We want peace. We want peace.  And I realized it had to come from the people. After all  they decide  and they did. So the sounds that were before distorted and loud  were suddenly a melody. The sounds of the voices were harmonious. So it could happen. A democracy could be upheld peacefully. It could be  by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace. Now here's an interesting comparison. We in the West  we preach the values  the golden light of democracy  that we are the shining example of how it's done. But when it comes down to it  Ghana found itself in the same place in which the U.S. election stalled in the      presidential elections    Bush versus Gore. But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide  Ghana honored democracy and its people. It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide  the people did. Now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either. I mean  it was so incredibly close. The electoral commissioner declared  with the consent of the parties  to run an unprecedented second re run. So the people went back to the polls to determine their own president  not the legal system. And guess what  it worked. The defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle. I mean  at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy  they did not abuse their power. The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep  proving that the African is capable of governing himself. Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over  but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists  and that we must not take it for granted. Now I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa  and I'm still searching for my identity  but I saw Ghana create democracy better. Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently. And yes  we Africans can. Thank you. So I'm a doctor  but I kind of slipped sideways into research  and now I'm an epidemiologist. And nobody really knows what epidemiology is. Epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you. And it's best understood through example as the science of those crazy  wacky newspaper headlines. And these are just some of the examples. These are from the Daily Mail. Every country in the world has a newspaper like this. It has this bizarre  ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer. So here are some of the things they said cause cancer recently  divorce  Wi Fi  toiletries and coffee. Here are some of the things they say prevents cancer  crusts  red pepper  licorice and coffee. So already you can see there are contradictions. Coffee both causes and prevents cancer. And as you start to read on  you can see that maybe there's some kind of political valence behind some of this. So for women  housework prevents breast cancer  but for men  shopping could make you impotent. So we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this. And what I hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims  unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims  isn't a kind of nasty carping activity  it's socially useful  but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool. Because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else's position. That's what happens in academic journals. That's what happens at academic conferences. The Q A session after a post op presents data is often a blood bath. And nobody minds that. We actively welcome it. It's like a consenting intellectual S M activity. So what I'm going to show you is all of the main things  all of the main features of my discipline    evidence based medicine. And I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work  exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong. So we'll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man  and that is authority. In science  we don't care how many letters you have after your name. In science  we want to know what your reasons are for believing something. How do you know that something is good for us or bad for us  But we're also unimpressed by authority  because it's so easy to contrive. This is somebody called Dr. Gillian McKeith Ph.D  or  to give her full medical title  Gillian McKeith. Again  every country has somebody like this. She is our TV diet guru. She has massive five series of prime time television  giving out very lavish and exotic health advice. She  it turns out  has a non accredited correspondence course Ph.D. from somewhere in America. She also boasts that she's a certified professional member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants  which sounds very glamorous and exciting. You get a certificate and everything. This one belongs to my dead cat Hetti. She was a horrible cat. You just go to the website  fill out the form  give them      and it arrives in the post. Now that's not the only reason that we think this person is an idiot. She also goes and says things like  you should eat lots of dark green leaves  because they contain lots of chlorophyll  and that will really oxygenate your blood. And anybody who's done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight  and it's quite dark in your bowels after you've eaten spinach. Next  we need proper science  proper evidence. So   Red wine can help prevent breast cancer.  This is a headline from the Daily Telegraph in the U.K.  A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer.  So you go and find this paper  and what you find is it is a real piece of science. It is a description of the changes in one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere. And that's a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper  but on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer if you drink red wine  it tells you absolutely bugger all. Actually  it turns out that your risk of breast cancer actually increases slightly with every amount of alcohol that you drink. So what we want is studies in real human people. And here's another example. This is from Britain's leading diet and nutritionist in the Daily Mirror  which is our second biggest selling newspaper.  An Australian study in      found that olive oil in combination with fruits  vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings.  And then they give you advice   If you eat olive oil and vegetables  you'll have fewer skin wrinkles.  And they very helpfully tell you how to go and find the paper. So you go and find the paper  and what you find is an observational study. Obviously nobody has been able to go back to       get all the people born in one maternity unit  and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil  and then half of them eat McDonald's  and then we see how many wrinkles you've got later. You have to take a snapshot of how people are now. And what you find is  of course  people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles. But that's because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil  they're freaks  they're not normal  they're like you  they come to events like this. They are posh  they're wealthy  they're less likely to have outdoor jobs  they're less likely to do manual labor  they have better social support  they're less likely to smoke    so for a whole host of fascinating  interlocking social  political and cultural reasons  they are less likely to have skin wrinkles. That doesn't mean that it's the vegetables or the olive oil. So ideally what you want to do is a trial. And everybody thinks they're very familiar with the idea of a trial. Trials are very old. The first trial was in the Bible    Daniel     . It's very straightforward    you take a bunch of people  you split them in half  you treat one group one way  you treat the other group the other way  and a little while later  you follow them up and see what happened to each of them. So I'm going to tell you about one trial  which is probably the most well reported trial in the U.K. news media over the past decade. And this is the trial of fish oil pills. And the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children. And they said   We've done a trial. All the previous trials were positive  and we know this one's gonna be too.  That should always ring alarm bells. Because if you already know the answer to your trial  you shouldn't be doing one. Either you've rigged it by design  or you've got enough data so there's no need to randomize people anymore. So this is what they were going to do in their trial. They were taking       children  they were going to give them all these huge fish oil pills  six of them a day  and then a year later  they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare their school exam performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn't had the pills. Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design  And no professors of clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question. So there's no control  there's no control group. But that sounds really techie. That's a technical term. The kids got the pills  and then their performance improved. What else could it possibly be if it wasn't the pills  They got older. We all develop over time. And of course  also there's the placebo effect. The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine. It's not just about taking a pill  and your performance and your pain getting better. It's about our beliefs and expectations. It's about the cultural meaning of a treatment. And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another. So we know  for example  that two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment for getting rid of gastric ulcers than one sugar pill. Two sugar pills a day beats one sugar pill a day. And that's an outrageous and ridiculous finding  but it's true. We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill  taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it    not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body  but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention. So we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated  which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo    where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo. But that's not enough. What I've just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes. What I find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices  but slightly more sophisticated versions of them  in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients  and which we use to make vitally important decisions. So firstly  trials against placebo  everybody thinks they know that a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo. But actually in a lot of situations that's wrong. Because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available  so we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing. We want to know that it's better than the best currently available treatment that we have. And yet  repeatedly  you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo. And you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it's better than nothing  which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision. But that's not the only way you can rig your data. You can also rig your data by making the thing you compare your new drug against really rubbish. You can give the competing drug in too low a dose  so that people aren't properly treated. You can give the competing drug in too high a dose  so that people get side effects. And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.    years ago  a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects. So people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs  but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses       milligrams a day of haloperidol. And it's a foregone conclusion  if you give a drug at that high a dose  that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better.    years ago  history repeated itself  interestingly  when risperidone  which was the first of the new generation antipscyhotic drugs  came off copyright  so anybody could make copies. Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone  so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day. Again  not an insane dose  not an illegal dose  but very much at the high end of normal. And so you're bound to make your new drug look better. And so it's no surprise that overall  industry funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials. But    and it's a big but    it turns out  when you look at the methods used by industry funded trials  that they're actually better than independently sponsored trials. And yet  they always manage to to get the result that they want. So how does this work  How can we explain this strange phenomenon  Well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action  it's withheld from doctors and patients. And this is the most important aspect of the whole story. It's at the top of the pyramid of evidence. We need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective. And there are two different ways that you can spot whether some data has gone missing in action. You can use statistics  or you can use stories. I personally prefer statistics  so that's what I'm going to do first. This is something called funnel plot. And a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared  have gone missing in action. So this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment. And as you go up towards the top of the graph  what you see is each dot is a trial. And as you go up  those are the bigger trials  so they've got less error in them. So they're less likely to be randomly false positives  randomly false negatives. So they all cluster together. The big trials are closer to the true answer. Then as you go further down at the bottom  what you can see is  over on this side  the spurious false negatives  and over on this side  the spurious false positives. If there is publication bias  if small negative trials have gone missing in action  you can see it on one of these graphs. So you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared. This is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias. And I think that's the funniest epidemiology joke that you will ever hear. That's how you can prove it statistically  but what about stories  Well they're heinous  they really are. This is a drug called reboxetine. This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients. And I'm a very nerdy doctor. I hope I try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature. I read the trials on this. They were all positive. They were all well conducted. I found no flaw. Unfortunately  it turned out  that many of these trials were withheld. In fact     percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients. Now if you think about it  if I tossed a coin a hundred times  and I'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times  then I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads. If we remove half of the data  we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is. And this is not an isolated story. Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld  but it goes way beyond that. The Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together. The Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown. And they need to have access to all of the trial data. But the companies withheld that data from them  and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years. This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution. And to show how big it goes  this is a drug called Tamiflu  which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on. And they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will reduce the rate of complications with flu. We already have the data showing that it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours. But I don't really care about that. Governments don't care about that. I'm very sorry if you have the flu  I know it's horrible  but we're not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day. We prescribe these drugs  we stockpile them for emergencies on the understanding that they will reduce the number of complications  which means pneumonia and which means death. The infectious diseases Cochrane Group  which are based in Italy  has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not  and they've not been able to get that information. This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today. We cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information. So it's a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclusion. But I would say this  I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant. All of these things are happening in plain sight  and they're all protected by a force field of tediousness. And I think  with all of the problems in science  one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid  finger around in the mechanics and peer in. Thank you very much. What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure  wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in     . The musicians played off a three dimensional graph of weather data like this. Every single bead  every single colored band  represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note. I find weather extremely fascinating. Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us. So I use sculpture and music to make it  not just visible  but also tactile and audible. All of my work begins very simple. I extract information from a specific environment using very low tech data collecting devices    generally anything I can find in the hardware store. I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet    satellite images  weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys. That's both historical as well as real data. And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here. These clipboards are filled with numbers. And from all of these numbers  I start with only two or three variables. That begins my translation process. My translation medium is a very simple basket. A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements. When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements  I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form. I use natural reed  because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control. That means that it is the numbers that control the form  not me. What I come up with are forms like these. These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data. Every colored bead  every colored string  represents a weather element. And together  these elements  not only construct the form  but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two dimensional graph. When you step closer  you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers. The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day. So all the way around  you have a    hour timeline. But it's also used to assign a temperature range. On that grid  I can then weave the high tide readings  water temperature  air temperature and Moon phases. I also translate weather data into musical scores. And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it. So all of these scores are made up of weather data. Every single color  dot  every single line  is a weather element. And together  these variables construct a score. I use these scores to collaborate with musicians. This is the      Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum. Meanwhile  I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this  that function still in the sense of being a three dimensional weather visualization  but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score  so it can actually be read as a musical score. What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art  versus science. This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it. You place it in an art museum  it becomes a sculpture. You place it in a science museum  it becomes a three dimensional visualization of data. You place it in a music hall  it all of a sudden becomes a musical score. And I really like that  because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music. The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science. And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science. So for me  that was my way into it. Thank you. You all know the truth of what I'm going to say. I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution. What's changed is we now can look at the evidence  we can compare societies  more and less equal societies  and see what inequality does. I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist. But first  see what a miserable lot we are. I want to start though with a paradox. This shows you life expectancy against gross national income    how rich countries are on average. And you see the countries on the right  like Norway and the USA  are twice as rich as Israel  Greece  Portugal on the left. And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all. There's no suggestion of a relationship there. But if we look within our societies  there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society. This  again  is life expectancy. These are small areas of England and Wales    the poorest on the right  the richest on the left. A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us. Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top. So income means something very important within our societies  and nothing between them. The explanation of that paradox is that  within our societies  we're looking at relative income or social position  social status    where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us. And as soon as you've got that idea  you should immediately wonder  what happens if we widen the differences  or compress them  make the income differences bigger or smaller  And that's what I'm going to show you. I'm not using any hypothetical data. I'm taking data from the U.N.    it's the same as the World Bank has    on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies. The measure we've used  because it's easy to understand and you can download it  is how much richer the top    percent than the bottom    percent in each country. And you see in the more equal countries on the left    Japan  Finland  Norway  Sweden    the top    percent are about three and a half  four times as rich as the bottom    percent. But on the more unequal end    U.K.  Portugal  USA  Singapore    the differences are twice as big. On that measure  we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies. Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies. We collected data on problems with social gradients  the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder. Internationally comparable data on life expectancy  on kids' maths and literacy scores  on infant mortality rates  homicide rates  proportion of the population in prison  teenage birthrates  levels of trust  obesity  mental illness    which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction    and social mobility. We put them all in one index. They're all weighted equally. Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things. And there  you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you  which I shall use over and over again in the data. The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems. It's an extraordinarily close correlation. But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita  gross national income  there's nothing there  no correlation anymore. We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence  so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well being. It has    different components put together by other people. It contains whether kids can talk to their parents  whether they have books at home  what immunization rates are like  whether there's bullying at school. Everything goes into it. Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality. Kids do worse in the more unequal societies. Highly significant relationship. But once again  if you look at that measure of child well being  in relation to national income per person  there's no relationship  no suggestion of a relationship. What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing. The average well being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth. That's very important in poorer countries  but not in the rich developed world. But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much. I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index. Here  for instance  is trust. It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted. It comes from the World Values Survey. You see  at the more unequal end  it's about    percent of the population who feel they can trust others. But in the more equal societies  it rises to    or    percent. And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital  very similar relationships closely related to inequality. I may say  we did all this work twice. We did it first on these rich  developed countries  and then as a separate test bed  we repeated it all on the    American states    asking just the same question  do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures  So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality. Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust. Same thing is going on. Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the    states in that separate test bed. We're not just talking about a fluke. This is mental illness. WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society. This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year. And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that    whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others. And again  closely related to inequality. This is violence. These red dots are American states  and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces. But look at the scale of the differences. It goes from    homicides per million up to    . This is the proportion of the population in prison. There's a about a tenfold difference there  log scale up the side. But it goes from about    to     people in prison. That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime. In some places  that's part of it. But most of it is about more punitive sentencing  harsher sentencing. And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty. Here we have children dropping out of high school. Again  quite big differences. Extraordinarily damaging  if you're talking about using the talents of the population. This is social mobility. It's actually a measure of mobility based on income. Basically  it's asking  do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons  or is there no relationship between the two  And at the more unequal end  fathers' income is much more important    in the U.K.  USA. And in Scandinavian countries  fathers' income is much less important. There's more social mobility. And as we like to say    and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here    if Americans want to live the American dream  they should go to Denmark. I've shown you just a few things in italics here. I could have shown a number of other problems. They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient. But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries    not just a little bit worse  but anything from twice as common to    times as common. Think of the expense  the human cost of that. I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points. One is that  in graph after graph  we find the countries that do worse  whatever the outcome  seem to be the more unequal ones  and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan. So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality. It's not just one or two things that go wrong  it's most things. The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that  if you look at the bottom  Sweden and Japan  they're very different countries in all sorts of ways. The position of women  how closely they keep to the nuclear family  are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world. But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality. Sweden has huge differences in earnings  and it narrows the gap through taxation  general welfare state  generous benefits and so on. Japan is rather different though. It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax. It has lower taxes. It has a smaller welfare state. And in our analysis of the American states  we find rather the same contrast. There are some states that do well through redistribution  some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax. So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality  as long as you get there somehow. I am not talking about perfect equality  I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies. Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality. There seems to be some truth in John Donne's  No man is an island.  And in a number of studies  it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy. This is just one example. It's infant mortality. Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification. And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations  so single parents go on their own. But then where it says  low social class   that's unskilled manual occupations. It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle  then the junior non manual  going up high to the professional occupations    doctors  lawyers  directors of larger companies. You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy. The biggest differences are at the bottom of society. But even at the top  there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society. We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally. And that seems to be the general picture    that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom  but has some benefits even at the top. But I should say a few words about what's going on. I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality. More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority  of being valued and devalued  respected and disrespected. And of course  those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society. It also leads to status insecurity. We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others  whether we're regarded as attractive  clever  all that kind of thing. The social evaluative judgments increase  the fear of those social evaluative judgments. Interestingly  some parallel work going on in social psychology  some people reviewed     different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones  their responses to doing stressful tasks  measured. And in the review  what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol  the central stress hormone. And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social evaluative threat    threats to self esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance. Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress. Now we have been criticized. Of course  there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising. I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data  we never pick and choose data. We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at  it goes into the analysis. Our data source decides whether it's reliable data  we don't. Otherwise that would introduce bias. What about other countries  There are     studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer reviewed journals. This isn't confined to these countries here  hiding a very simple demonstration. The same countries  the same measure of inequality  one problem after another. Why don't we control for other factors  Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference. And of course  others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on. What about causality  Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality. We spend a good bit of time. And indeed  people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes. The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system  the cardiovascular system. Or for instance  the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on. I should say that to deal with this  we've got to deal with the post tax things and the pre tax things. We've got to constrain income  the bonus culture incomes at the top. I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can. I think the take home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us. Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well being of whole societies  and that's exciting. Thank you. Thank you. It's a real pleasure to be here. I last did a TED Talk I think about seven years ago or so. I talked about spaghetti sauce. And so many people  I guess  watch those videos. People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce  which is a wonderful thing in the short term    but it's proven to be less than ideal over seven years. And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me. The theme of this morning's session is Things We Make. And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era. And the man's name is Carl Norden. Carl Norden was born in     . And he was Swiss. And of course  the Swiss can be divided into two general categories  those who make small  exquisite  expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small  exquisite  expensive objects. And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp. He's an engineer. He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich. In fact  one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin who would go on to break small  expensive  exquisite objects. And he's a Swiss engineer  Carl. And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word. He wears three piece suits  and he has a very  very small  important mustache  and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego  and he works    hour days  and he has very strong feelings about alternating current  and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness  and he drinks lots of coffee  and he does his best work sitting in his mother's kitchen in Zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule. In any case  Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan. And he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane. Now if you think about it  in the age before GPS and radar  that was obviously a really difficult problem. It's a complicated physics problem. You've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air  going at hundreds of miles an hour  and you're trying to drop an object  a bomb  towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments. And all sorts of people  moving up to the First World War and between the wars  tried to solve this problem  and nearly everybody came up short. The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude. But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code. And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device. It weighs about    lbs. It's called the Norden Mark    bombsight. And it has all kinds of levers and ball bearings and gadgets and gauges. And he makes this complicated thing. And what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object  visually sight the target  because they're in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber  and then they plug in the altitude of the plane  the speed of the plane  the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target. And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb. And as Norden famously says   Before that bombsight came along  bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more.  But he said  with the Mark    Norden bombsight  he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at        ft. Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight. It was like manna from heaven. Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War  where millions of men fought each other in the trenches  getting nowhere  making no progress  and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy. And the U.S. military spends  .  billion dollars    billion dollars in      dollars    developing the Norden bombsight. And to put that in perspective  the total cost of the Manhattan project was three billion dollars. Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military industrial project of the modern era. And there were people  strategists  within the U.S. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the Nazis and against the Japanese. And for Norden as well  this device had incredible moral importance  because Norden was a committed Christian. In fact  he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention  because in his eyes  only God could invent things. He was simply the instrument of God's will. And what was God's will  Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible. And what did the Norden bombsight do  Well it allowed you to do that. It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb. So in the years leading up to the Second World War  the U.S. military buys        of these Norden bombsights at a cost of         each    again  in      dollars  that's a lot of money. And they trained        bombardiers on how to use them    long extensive  months long training sessions    because these things are essentially analog computers  they're not easy to use. And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath  to swear that if they're ever captured  they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy  because it's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology. And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane  it's escorted there by a series of armed guards. And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it. And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards. It's never allowed to be photographed. And there's a little incendiary device inside of it  so that  if the plane ever crashes  it will be destroyed and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it. The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail. So what happens during the Second World War  Well  it turns out it's not the Holy Grail. In practice  the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at        ft.  but that's under perfect conditions. And of course  in wartime  conditions aren't perfect. First of all  it's really hard to use    really hard to use. And not all of the people who are of those        men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer. Secondly  it breaks down a lot. It's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball bearings  and they don't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle. Thirdly  when Norden was making his calculations  he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes. Well in a real war  you can't do that  you'll get shot down. So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds. And the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well under those conditions. But most of all  the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target. But of course  what happens in real life  There are clouds  right. It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate. Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between      and       Not a lot. And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was  there was a famous case in      where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna  Germany. And the chemical plant comprised     acres. And over the course of    bombing missions  the Allies dropped        bombs on this     acre chemical plant  using the Norden bombsight. Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the     acre perimeter of the plant     percent.    percent. And of those    percent that landed     percent didn't even go off  they were duds. The Leuna chemical plant  after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war  was up and running within weeks. And by the way  all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis  Well it turns out that Carl Norden  as a proper Swiss  was very enamored of German engineers. So in the     s  he hired a whole bunch of them  including a man named Hermann Long who  in       gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis. So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war    which also  by the way  didn't work very well. So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight  Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights. We live in a time where there are all kinds of really  really smart people running around  saying that they've invented gadgets that will forever change our world. They've invented websites that will allow people to be free. They've invented some kind of this thing  or this thing  or this thing that will make our world forever better. If you go into the military  you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well. If you go to the Pentagon  they will say   You know what  now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at        ft.  And you know what  it's true  they actually can do that now. But we need to be very clear about how little that means. In the Iraq War  at the beginning of the first Iraq War  the U.S. military  the air force  sent two squadrons of F   E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor. And their mission was to find and to destroy    remember the Scud missile launchers  those surface to air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis  The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers. And so they flew missions day and night  and they dropped thousands of bombs  and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge. And after the war was over  there was an audit done    as the army always does  the air force always does    and they asked the question  how many Scuds did we actually destroy  You know what the answer was  Zero  not a single one. Now why is that  Is it because their weapons weren't accurate  Oh no  they were brilliantly accurate. They could have destroyed this little thing right here from        ft. The issue was they didn't know where the Scud launchers were. The problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel  it's knowing how to find the pickle barrel. That's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars. Or take the battle in Afghanistan. What is the signature weapon of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan  It's the drone. What is the drone  Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark    bombsight. It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision. And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan  the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles  and it's used those drones to kill       suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants. Now what is the accuracy of those drones  Well it's extraordinary. We think we're now at    percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes.    percent of the people we kill need to be killed  right  That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare. But do you know what the crucial thing is  In that exact same period that we've been using these drones with devastating accuracy  the number of attacks  of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks  against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold. As we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them  they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us. I have not described to you a success story. I've described to you the opposite of a success story. And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make. We think the things we make can solve our problems  but our problems are much more complex than that. The issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have  it's how you use the bombs you have  and more importantly  whether you ought to use bombs at all. There's a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight. And that is  on August          a B    bomber called the Enola Gay flew over Japan and  using a Norden bombsight  dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of Hiroshima. And as was typical with the Norden bombsight  the bomb actually missed its target by     ft. But of course  it didn't matter. And that's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight. the air force's  .  billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb  which didn't need a bombsight at all. Meanwhile  back in New York  no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima. He was a committed Christian. He thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war. It would have broken his heart. I moved to Boston    years ago  from Chicago  with an interest in cancer and in chemistry. You might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules    or to my taste  new drugs for cancer. And you might also know that  for science and medicine  Boston is a bit of a candy store. You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge without hitting a graduate student. The bar is called the Miracle of Science. The billboards say  Lab Space Available.  And it's fair to say that in these    years  we've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution    that of genome medicine. We know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before. And we're able  finally  to answer the question that's been so pressing for so many years  why do I have cancer  This information is also pretty staggering. You might know that  so far in just the dawn of this revolution  we know that there are perhaps        unique mutations affecting more than        genes  and that there are     of these genes that are bona fide drivers  causes of cancer. Yet comparatively  we have about a dozen targeted medications. And this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We didn't fly him to Boston. We didn't sequence his genome. It's been known for decades what causes this malignancy. It's three proteins    Ras  Myc and P  . This is old information we've known since about the   s  yet there's no medicine I can prescribe to a patient with this or any of the numerous solid tumors caused by these three horsemen of the apocalypse that is cancer. There's no Ras  no Myc  no P   drug. And you might fairly ask  why is that  And the very unsatisfying  yet scientific  answer is it's too hard. That for whatever reason  these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that's called the undruggable genome    which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the Moon unwalkable. It's a horrible term of trade. But what it means is that we fail to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins  into which we  like molecular locksmiths  can fashion an active  small  organic molecule or drug substance. Now as I was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation  what we had instead  cascading through the regulatory network at the FDA  were these substances    arsenic  thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas. And this is the   st century. And so  I guess you'd say  dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines  I went back to school in chemistry with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open source  the crowd source  the collaborative network that we have access to within academia  that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies to our patients. And so please consider this a work in progress  but I'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma  about the protein target  the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer  called BRD   and about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana Farber Cancer Institute called JQ   which we affectionately named for Jun Qi  the chemist that made this molecule. Now BRD  is an interesting protein. You might ask yourself  with all the things cancer's trying to do to kill our patient  how does it remember it's cancer  When it winds up its genome  divides into two cells and unwinds again  why does it not turn into an eye  into a liver  as it has all the genes necessary to do this  It remembers that it's cancer. And the reason is that cancer  like every cell in the body  places little molecular bookmarks  little Post it notes  that remind the cell  I'm cancer  I should keep growing.  And those Post it notes involve this and other proteins of its class    so called bromodomains. So we developed an idea  a rationale  that perhaps  if we made a molecule that prevented the Post it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein  then maybe we could convince cancer cells  certainly those addicted to this BRD  protein  that they're not cancer. And so we started to work on this problem. We developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called JQ . Now not being a drug company  we could do certain things  we had certain flexibilities  that I respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn't have. We just started mailing it to our friends. I have a small lab. We thought we'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves. And we sent it to Oxford  England where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture  which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent for this protein target. It's what we call a perfect fit of shape complimentarity  or hand in glove. Now this is a very rare cancer  this BRD  addicted cancer. And so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at Brigham Women's Hospital. And as we treated these cells with this molecule  we observed something really striking. The cancer cells  small  round and rapidly dividing  grew these arms and extensions. They were changing shape. In effect  the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell. This got us very excited. The next step would be to put this molecule into mice. The only problem was there's no mouse model of this rare cancer. And so at the time that we were doing this research  I was caring for a    year old firefighter from Connecticut who was very much at the end of life with this incurable cancer. This BRD  addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung  and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris. And every nursing shift we would throw this material out. And so we approached this patient and asked if he would collaborate with us. Could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial and stage it with a prototype drug  Well that would be impossible and  rightly  illegal to do in humans. And he obliged us. At the Lurie Family Center for Animal Imaging  my colleague  Andrew Kung  grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic. And you can see this PET scan of a mouse    what we call a pet PET. The cancer is growing as this red  huge mass in the hind limb of this animal. And as we treat it with our compound  this addiction to sugar  this rapid growth  faded. And on the animal on the right  you see that the cancer was responding. We've completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease. And every time  we see the same thing. The mice with this cancer that get the drug live  and the ones that don't rapidly perish. So we started to wonder  what would a drug company do at this point  Well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn a prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance. And so we did just the opposite. We published a paper that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage. We gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule  typically a secret in our discipline. We told people exactly how to make it. We gave them our email address  suggesting that  if they write us  we'll send them a free molecule. We basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible. And this was  unfortunately  successful. Because now when we've shared this molecule  just since December of last year  with    laboratories in the United States and    more in Europe    many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space  to target this rare cancer that  thankfully right now  is quite desirable to study in that industry. But the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own. Leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells. Mice with multiple myeloma  an incurable malignancy of the bone marrow  respond dramatically to the treatment with this drug. You might know that fat has memory. Nice to be able to demonstrate that for you. And in fact  this molecule prevents this adipocyte  this fat stem cell  from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet  like the folks in my hometown of Chicago  fail to develop fatty liver  which is a major medical problem. What this research taught us    not just my lab  but our institute  and Harvard Medical School more generally    is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery    that our center that has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other  never made one of its own. For all the reasons you see listed here  we think there's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest  conceptually tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery. So what next  We have this molecule  but it's not a pill yet. It's not orally available. We need to fix it  so that we can deliver it to our patients. And everyone in the lab  especially following the interaction with these patients  feels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance based on this molecule. It's here where I have to say that we could use your help and your insights  your collaborative participation. Unlike a drug company  we don't have a pipeline that we can deposit these molecules into. We don't have a team of salespeople and marketeers that can tell us how to position this drug against the other. What we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent  motivated  enthusiastic  hopefully well funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide. This molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called Tensha Therapeutics. And really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery  two of which    a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin  an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma    will actually come to the bedside for first clinical trial in July of this year. For us  a major and exciting milestone. I want to leave you with just two ideas. The first is if anything is unique about this research  it's less the science than the strategy    that this for us was a social experiment  an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be. This string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses that can be texted  I suppose  or Twittered worldwide  is the chemical identity of our pro compound. It's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies  the information on how these early prototype drugs might work. Yet this information is largely a secret. And so we seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles  that of opensource and that of crowdsourcing to quickly  responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer. Now the business model involves all of you. This research is funded by the public. It's funded by foundations. And one thing I've learned in Boston is that you people will do anything for cancer    and I love that. You bike across the state. You walk up and down the river. I've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research. And so I want to thank you for your participation  your collaboration and most of all for your confidence in our ideas. I am a papercutter. I cut stories. So my process is very straightforward. I take a piece of paper  I visualize my story  sometimes I sketch  sometimes I don't. And as my image is already inside the paper  I just have to remove what's not from that story. So I didn't come to papercutting in a straight line. In fact  I see it more as a spiral. I was not born with a blade in my hand. And I don't remember papercutting as a child. As a teenager  I was sketching  drawing  and I wanted to be an artist. But I was also a rebel. And I left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs. So among them  I have been a shepherdess  a truck driver  a factory worker  a cleaning lady. I worked in tourism for one year in Mexico  one year in Egypt. I moved for two years in Taiwan. And then I settled in New York where I became a tour guide. And I still worked as a tour leader  traveled back and forth in China  Tibet and Central Asia. So of course  it took time  and I was nearly     and I decided it's time to start as an artist. I chose papercutting because paper is cheap  it's light  and you can use it in a lot of different ways. And I chose the language of silhouette because graphically it's very efficient. And it's also just getting to the essential of things. So the word  silhouette  comes from a minister of finance  Etienne de Silhouette. And he slashed so many budgets that people said they couldn't afford paintings anymore  and they needed to have their portrait  a la silhouette.  So I made series of images  cuttings  and I assembled them in portfolios. And people told me    like these    views of the Empire State building    they told me   You're making artist books.  So artist books have a lot of definitions. They come in a lot of different shapes. But to me  they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story. They can be with words or without words. And I have a passion for images and for words. I love pun and the relation to the unconscious. I love oddities of languages. And everywhere I lived  I learned the languages  but never mastered them. So I'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages. So as you can guess  my mother tongue is French. And my daily language is English. So I did a series of work where it was identical words in French and in English. So one of these works is the  Spelling Spider.  So the Spelling Spider is a cousin of the spelling bee. But it's much more connected to the Web. And this spider spins a bilingual alphabet. So you can read  architecture active  or  active architecture.  So this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives. So if you don't know one of these languages  it's instant learning. And one ancient form of the book is scrolls. So scrolls are very convenient  because you can create a large image on a very small table. So the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image  so it makes a very freestyle architecture. And I'm making all those kinds of windows. So it's to look beyond the surface. It's to have a look at different worlds. And very often I've been an outsider. So I want to see how things work and what's happening. So each window is an image and is a world that I often revisit. And I revisit this world thinking about the image or clich  about what we want to do  and what are the words  colloquialisms  that we have with the expressions. It's all if. So what if we were living in balloon houses  It would make a very uplifting world. And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet. It would be so light. So sometimes I view from the inside  like EgoCentriCity and the inner circles. Sometimes it's a global view  to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams. And we can use them also as a safety net. And my inspirations are very eclectic. I'm influenced by everything I read  everything I see. I have some stories that are humorous  like  Dead Beats.  Other ones are historical. Here it's  CandyCity.  It's a non sugar coated history of sugar. It goes from slave trade to over consumption of sugar with some sweet moments in between. And sometimes I have an emotional response to news  such as the      Haitian earthquake. Other times  it's not even my stories. People tell me their lives  their memories  their aspirations  and I create a mindscape. I channel their history  so that  they have a place to go back to look at their life and its possibilities. I call them Freudian cities. I cannot speak for all my images  so I'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title.  ModiCity.   ElectriCity.   MAD Growth on Columbus Circle.   ReefCity.   A Web of Time.   Chaos City.   Daily Battles.   FeliCity.   Floating Islands.  And at one point  I had to do  The Whole Nine Yards.  So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long. So in life and in papercutting  everything is connected. One story leads to another. I was also interested in the physicality of this format  because you have to walk to see it. And parallel to my cutting is my running. I started with small images  I started with a few miles. Larger images  I started to run marathons. Then I went to run   K  then   K. Then I ran    miles    ultramarathons. And I still feel I'm running  it's just the training to become a long distance papercutter. And running gives me a lot of energy. Here is a three week papercutting marathon at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. The result is  Hells and Heavens.  It's two panels    ft. high. They were installed in the museum on two floors  but in fact  it's a continuous image. And I call it  Hells and Heavens  because it's daily hells and daily heavens. There is no border in between. Some people are born in hells  and against all odds  they make it to heavens. Other people make the opposite trip. That's the border. You have sweatshops in hells. You have people renting their wings in the heavens. And then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we even have the same action  and the result puts you in hells or in heavens. So the whole  Hells and Heavens  is about free will and determinism. And in papercutting  you have the drawing as the structure itself. So you can take it off the wall. Here it's an artist book installation called  Identity Project.  It's not autobiographical identities. They are more our social identities. And then you can just walk behind them and try them on. So it's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity. That's another artist book project. In fact  in the picture  you have two of them. It's one I'm wearing and one that's on exhibition at the Center for Books Arts in New York City. Why do I call it a book  It's called  Fashion Statement   and there are quotes about fashion  so you can read it  and also  because the definition of artist book is very generous. So artist books  you take them off the wall. You take them for a walk. You can also install them as public art. Here it's in Scottsdale  Arizona  and it's called  Floating Memories.  So it's regional memories  and they are just randomly moved by the wind. I love public art. And I entered competitions for a long time. After eight years of rejection  I was thrilled to get my first commission with the Percent for Art in New York City. It was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen. I made an artist book that's in stainless steel instead of paper. I called it  Working in the Same Direction.  But I added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions. With public art  I could also make cut glass. Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx. And each time I make public art  I want something that's really relevant to the place it's installed. So for the subway in New York  I saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading. It is travel in time  travel on time. And Bronx literature  it's all about Bronx writers and their stories. Another glass project is in a public library in San Jose  California. So I made a vegetable point of view of the growth of San Jose. So I started in the center with the acorn for the Ohlone Indian civilization. Then I have the fruit from Europe for the ranchers. And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today. And it's still growing. So the technique  it's cut  sandblasted  etched and printed glass into architectural glass. And outside the library  I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind. I took library material that had fruit in their title and I used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge. I also planted the bibliotree. So it's a tree  and in its trunk you have the roots of languages. And it's all about international writing systems. And on the branches you have library material growing. You can also have function and form with public art. So in Aurora  Colorado it's a bench. But you have a bonus with this bench. Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts  you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs. Another functional work  it's in the south side of Chicago for a subway station. And it's called  Seeds of the Future are Planted Today.  It's a story about transformation and connections. So it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter  and not to have objects falling on the rails. To be able to change fences and window guards into flowers  it's fantastic. And here I've been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low income buildings and affordable housing. So each building has its own personality. And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood  like in Morrisania  about the jazz history. And for other projects  like in Paris  it's about the name of the street. It's called Rue des Prairies    Prairie Street. So I brought back the rabbit  the dragonfly  to stay in that street. And in       I was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in New York City for a year. So that was a very captive audience. And I wanted to give them an escape. I created  All Around Town.  It is a papercutting  and then after  I added color on the computer. So I can call it techno crafted. And along the way  I'm kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques. But the result is always to have stories. So the stories  they have a lot of possibilities. They have a lot of scenarios. I don't know the stories. I take images from our global imagination  from clich   from things we are thinking about  from history. And everybody's a narrator  because everybody has a story to tell. But more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world. And in all these universes  it's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with  but the destination is our minds and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic. And it's what story cutting is all about. Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist. And usually when I tell people I'm an artist  they just look at me and say   Do you paint   or  What kind of medium do you work in   Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique. So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving. And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago. So let me show you a little of that. So it started over here. And this is the Detroit airport in June   th of     . I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas. And as I was coming back  well I was taken by the FBI  met by an FBI agent  and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions     Where were you  What were you doing  Who were you talking with  Why were you there  Who pays for your trips      all these little details. And then literally just out of nowhere  the guy asks me   Where were you September   th   And when most of us get asked   Where were you September   th   or any date for that fact  it's like   I don't exactly remember  but I can look it up for you.  So I pulled out my little PDA  and I said   Okay  let's look up my appointments for September   th.  I had September   th    from       a.m. to       a.m.  I paid my storage bill. From       a.m. to       p.m.  I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time. From       p.m. to      p.m.  I taught my intro class       p.m. to      p.m.  I taught my advanced class.  Where were you the   th    Where were you the   th    Where were you the   th  the   th    Where were you October  th   We read about six months of my calendar. And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did. But good thing I did  because I don't look good in orange. So he asked me     So this storage unit that you paid the rent on  what did you have in it   This was in Tampa  Florida  so I was like   Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida. Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment. Just assorted garage sale junk  because I'm a pack rat.  And he looks at me really confused and says   No explosives   I was like   No  no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives. And if there were  I would have remembered that one.  And he's still a little confused  but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat. And so we're sitting there  and eventually after about an hour  hour and a half of just going back and forth  he says   Okay  I have enough information here. I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this. They'll follow up with you  and we'll take care of it.  I was like   Great.  So I got home and the phone rings  and a man introduced himself. Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life    back and forth  not six months continuously. By the way  you folks know that in the United States  you can't take photographs of federal buildings  but Google can do it for you. So to the folks from Google  thank you. So I spent a lot of time in this building. Questions like   Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation   And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this. You're basically face to face with someone that essentially decides life or death. Or questions such as    actually  during the polygraph  which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them    one of the polygraph questions was ... well the first one was   Is your name Hasan    Yes.   Are we in Florida    Yes.   Is today Tuesday    Yes.  Because you have to base it on a yes or no. Then  of course  the next question is   Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States   I work at a university. So I was like   Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly.  But they said   Okay  aside from what we had discussed  do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States   I was like   No.  So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs  they said   Hey  everything's fine.  I was like   I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along. I know everything's fine.  So they're looking at me really odd. And it's like   Guys  I travel a lot.  This is with the FBI. And I was like   All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo  and here we go all over again.  And there was a sincere concern there. And he was like   You know  if you get into trouble  give us a call    we'll take care of it.  So ever since then  before I would go anywhere  I would call the FBI. I would tell them   Hey guys  this is where I'm going. This is my flight. Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March   th  or whatever. A couple weeks later  I'd call again  let them know. It wasn't that I had to  but I chose to. Just wanted to say   Hey guys. Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves.   I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee. Just letting you know. Heads up.  And so I just kept doing this over and over and over. And then the phone calls turned into emails  and the emails got longer and longer and longer ... with pictures  with travel tips. Then I'd make websites. And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here. So I actually designed this back in     . So this kind of tracks me at any given moment. I wrote some code for my mobile phone. Basically  what I decided is okay guys  you want to watch me  that's cool. But I'll watch myself. It's okay. You don't have to waste your energy or your resources. And I'll help you out. So in the process  I start thinking  well what else might they know about me  Well they probably have all my flight records  so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online. So you can see  Delta      going from Kansas City to Atlanta. And then you see  these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes. This was on Delta     going from JFK to San Francisco. See that  They won't let me on a plane with that  but they'll give it to me on the plane. These are the airports that I hang out in  because I like airports. That's Kennedy airport  May   th  Tuesday. This is in Warsaw. Singapore. You can see  they're kind of empty. These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone. But if you can cross reference this with the other data  then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together. And when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence  you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner. At the time that this was going on  the last thing on my mind was  art project.  I was certainly not thinking  hey  I got new work here. But after going through this  after realizing  well what just happened  And after piecing together this  this and this  this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this  and it actually became this project. So these are the stores that I shop in    some of them    because they need to know. This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch    in Daly City on Sunday  November   th. At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi. And I bought some crabs too right around there  and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville. And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland    East Oakland  sorry. And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route    in East Brunswick. Now if you go to my bank records  it'll actually show something from there  so you know that  on May  th  that I bought    .   in fuel from Safeway Vallejo. So not only that I'm giving this information here and there  but now there's a third party  an independent third party  my bank  that's verifying that  yes indeed  I was there at this time. So there's points  and these points are actually being cross referenced. And there's a verification taking place. Sometimes they're really small purchases. So    cents foreign transaction fee. All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts  and everything pops up right away. Sometimes there's a lot of information. This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was. And then sometimes you get this. Sometimes you just get this  just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City  January   nd. And I can tell you exactly who I was with  where I was  because this is what I had to do with the FBI. I had to tell them every little detail of everything. I spend a lot of time on the road. This is a parking lot in Elko  Nevada off of Route    at      p.m. on August   th. I spend a lot of time in gas stations too    empty train stations. So there's multiple databases. And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images. There's actually        images right now on my site  and the FBI has seen all of them    at least I trust they've seen all of them. And then sometimes you don't get much information at all  you just get this empty bed. And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information. So you get something like this. This  by the way  is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California    Vietnamese sandwich. So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations  empty gas stations. These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home. So how do you know these are meals eaten at home  Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times. So again  you have to do some detective work here. So sometimes the databases get so specific. These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth. At       a.m. was this one. At      p.m. was this one. At      p.m. was this one. So I time stamp my life every few moments. Every few moments I shoot the image. Now it's all done on my iPhone  and it all goes straight up to my server  and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together. They need to know where I'm doing my business  because they want to know about my business. So on December  th  I went here. And on Sunday  June   th at         this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan  Maine    this was my apartment there. So what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information. If you go to my site  there's tons of things. And really  it's not the most user friendly interface. It's actually quite user unfriendly. And one of the reasons  also being part of the user unfriendliness  is that everything is there  but you have to really work through it. So by me putting all this information out there  what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything. But in this barrage of noise that I'm putting out  I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life. And you know very little about me actually. And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy  particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded  there's no need to delete information anymore. So what do you do when everything is out there  Well you have to take control over it. And if I give you this information directly  it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces. The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies    and it doesn't matter who they are    they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information  or restricted access to information. And the reason their information has any value is  well  because no one else has access to it. And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you  the information that the FBI has has no value  so thus devaluing their currency. And I understand that  on an individual level  it's purely symbolic. But if     million people in the U.S. started doing this  we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up. Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. And we're getting to that. When I first started this project  people were looking at me and saying   Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing  where you're at  Why are you posting these photos   This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and     million people were posting status messages or poking people. So in a way  I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete. I'm still doing this project  but it is obsolete  because you're all doing it. This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis  whether we're aware of it or not. So we're creating our own archives and so on. And you know  some of my friends have always said   Hey  you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this  Because no one's really watching. No one's really going to bother you.  So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully. Because it's about surveillance. I'm watching who's watching me. And I came up with these. So these are some of my sample logs. And just little bits and pieces  and you can see some of the things there. And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see. So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by    Department of Homeland Security. You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by. I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now. Central Intelligence Agency. Executive Office of the President. Not really sure why they show up  but they do. I think they kind of like to look at art. And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields. So thank you very much. I appreciate it. Bruno Giussani  Hasan  just curious. You said   Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone   but actually you do take the pictures and put on information. So how many hours of the day does that take  HE  Almost none. It's no different than sending a text. It's no different than checking an email. It's one of those things  we got by just fine before we had to do any of those. So it's just become another day. I mean  when we update a status message  we don't really think about how long that's going to take. So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks  send  and then it's done. And everything's automated at the other end. BG  On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage  the FBI gets crazy  HE  Well it goes to the last point that I was at. So it holds onto the very last point. So if I'm on a    hour flight  you'll see the last airport that I departed from. BG  Hasan  thank you very much.  HE  Thank you.  The night before I was heading for Scotland  I was invited to host the final of  China's Got Talent  show in Shanghai with the        live audience in the stadium. Guess who was the performing guest  Susan Boyle. And I told her   I'm going to Scotland the next day.  She sang beautifully  and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese      So it's not like  hello  or  thank you   that ordinary stuff. It means  green onion for free.  Why did she say that  Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle    a    some year old woman  a vegetable vendor in Shanghai  who loves singing Western opera  but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian  so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese. And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was  green onion for free.  So  as  Susan Boyle was saying that         live audience sang together. That was hilarious. So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness. They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment  yet their courage and talent brought them through. And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams. Well  being different is not that difficult. We are all different from different perspectives. But I think being different is good  because you present a different point of view. You may have the chance to make a difference. My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past        years. I remember that in the year of       when I was graduating from college  I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five star hotel in Beijing  Great Wall Sheraton    it's still there. So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour  he finally said   So  Miss Yang  do you have any questions to ask me   I summoned my courage and poise and said   Yes  but could you let me know  what actually do you sell   I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five star hotel. That was the first day I set my foot in a five star hotel. Around the same time  I was going through an audition    the first ever open audition by national television in China    with another thousand college girls. The producer told us they were looking for some sweet  innocent and beautiful fresh face. So when it was my turn  I stood up and said   Why  do  women's personalities on television always have to be beautiful  sweet  innocent and  you know  supportive  Why can't they have their own ideas and their own voice   I thought I kind of offended them. But actually  they were impressed by my words. And so I was in the second round of competition  and then the third and the fourth. After seven rounds of competition  I was the last one to survive it. So I was on a national television prime time show. And believe it or not  that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script. And my weekly audience at that time was between     to     million people. Well after a few years  I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies  and then started my own media company  which was unthought of during the years that I started my career. So we do a lot of things. I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past. And sometimes I have young people approaching me say   Lan  you changed my life   and I feel proud of that. But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country. I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games. I was representing the Shanghai Expo. I saw China embracing the world and vice versa. But then sometimes I'm thinking  what are today's young generation up to  How are they different  and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China  or at large  the world  So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media. First of all  who are they   What  do they look like  Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei       years old  beautiful. She showed off her expensive bags  clothes and car on her microblog  which is the Chinese version of Twitter. And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce. She didn't realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning  almost a turmoil  against the credibility of Red Cross. The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it  and the investigation is going on. So far  as of today  we know that she herself made up that title    probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity. All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend  who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce. It's very complicated to explain. But anyway  the public still doesn't buy it. It is still boiling. It shows us a general mistrust of government or government backed institutions  which lacked transparency in the past. And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog. Microblog boomed in the year of       with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled. Sina.com  a major news portal  alone has more than     million microbloggers. On Tencent      million. The most popular blogger    it's not me    it's a movie star  and she has more than  .  million followers  or fans. About    percent of those microbloggers are young people  under    years old. And because  as you know  the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government  social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit. But because you don't have many other openings  the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong  active and even violent. So through microblogging  we are able to understand Chinese youth even better. So how are they different  First of all  most of them were born in the   s and   s  under the one child policy. And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls  now we have ended up with    million more young men than women. That could pose a potential danger to the society  but who knows  we're in a globalized world  so they can look for girlfriends from other countries. Most of them have fairly good education. The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent. In cities     percent of kids go to college. But they are facing an aging China with a population above    years old coming up with seven point some percent this year  and about to be    percent by the year of     . And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially  and taking care of them when they're sick. So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of    years old. So making a living is not that easy for young people. College graduates are not in short supply. In urban areas  college graduates find the starting salary is about     U.S. dollars a month  while the average rent is above     . So what do they do  They have to share space    squeezed in very limited space to save money    and they call themselves  tribe of ants.  And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment  they figured out they have to work for    to    years to afford their first apartment. That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn  but in China it's    to    years with the skyrocketing real estate price. Among the     million migrant workers     percent of them are young people. They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas. Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside  but they don't have the sense of belonging. They work for longer hours with less income  less social welfare. And they're more vulnerable to job losses  subject to inflation  tightening loans from banks  appreciation of the renminbi  or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce. Last year  though  an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China     young workers in their late teens and early   s committed suicide  just one by one like causing a contagious disease. But they died because of all different personal reasons. But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation  both physical and mental  of these migrant workers. For those who do return back to the countryside  they find themselves very welcome locally  because with the knowledge  skills and networks they have learned in the cities  with the assistance of the Internet  they're able to create more jobs  upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market. So for the past few years  the coastal areas  they found themselves in a shortage of labor. These diagrams show a more general social background. The first one is the Engels coefficient  which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade  in terms of family income  to about    some percent. But then in the last two years  it goes up again to    percent  indicating a rising living cost. The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of  . . Now it's  .     even worse than that in America    showing us the income inequality. And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility. And also  the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread. So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest. So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging  we can see what young people care most about. Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand. For the past decade or so  a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property. And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation. Sometimes people get killed  and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest. So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet  people cry for the government to take actions to stop this. So the good news is that earlier this year  the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court. Similarly  many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet. We heard about polluted air  polluted water  poisoned food. And guess what  we have faked beef. They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish  and it turns it to look like beef. And then lately  people are very concerned about cooking oil  because thousands of people have been found  refining  cooking oil from restaurant slop. So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet. And fortunately  we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns. While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy making  but sometimes they're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life. China is soon to pass the U.S. as the number one market for luxury brands    that's not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere. But you know what  half of those consumers are earning a salary below       U.S. dollars. They're not rich at all. They're taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status. And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle. But of course  we do have young people who would still prefer to smile  whether in a BMW or  on  a bicycle. So in the next picture  you see a very popular phenomenon called  naked  wedding  or  naked  marriage. It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding  but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house  without a car  without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet  to show their commitment to true love. And also  people are doing good through social media. And the first picture showed us that a truck caging     homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging. People were donating money  dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck. And after hours of negotiation      dogs were rescued. And here also people are helping to find missing children. A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet. After thousands of resends in relay  the child was found  and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging. So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years. Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values  but also  it's about the environment. People are thinking about the following questions  Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP  How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth  to keep sustainability and stability  And also  how capable is the system of self correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time  I guess these are the questions people are going to answer. And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves. Thank you very much. So I have a strange career. I know it because people come up to me  like colleagues  and say   Chris  you have a strange career.  And I can see their point  because I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist. And I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions  and I was only    years old. No  no  I wasn't    years old. But after that  I actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department  and I wasn't doing any neuroscience. Later  I would work on evolutionary genetics  and I would work on systems biology. But I'm going to tell you about something else today. I'm going to tell you about how I learned something about life. And I was actually a rocket scientist. I wasn't really a rocket scientist  but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in sunny California where it's warm  whereas now I'm in the mid West  and it's cold. But it was an exciting experience. One day a NASA manager comes into my office  sits down and says   Can you please tell us  how do we look for life outside Earth   And that came as a surprise to me  because I was actually hired to work on quantum computation. Yet  I had a very good answer. I said   I have no idea.  And he told me   Biosignatures  we need to look for a biosignature.  And I said   What is that   And he said   It's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life.  And I said   Really  Because isn't that easy  I mean  we have life. Can't you apply a definition  like for example  a Supreme Court like definition of life   And then I thought about it a little bit  and I said   Well  is it really that easy  Because  yes  if you see something like this  then all right  fine  I'm going to call it life    no doubt about it. But here's something.  And he goes   Right  that's life too. I know that.  Except  if you think life is also defined by things that die  you're not in luck with this thing  because that's actually a very strange organism. It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase  and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again  and then actually grows back up  and back down and back up    sort of yo yo    and it never dies. So it's actually life  but it's actually not as we thought life would be. And then you see something like that. And he was like   My God  what kind of a life form is that   Anyone know  It's actually not life  it's a crystal. So once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things    so this particular person wrote a whole article and said   Hey  these are bacteria.  Except  if you look a little bit closer  you see  in fact  that this thing is way too small to be anything like that. So he was convinced  but  in fact  most people aren't. And then  of course  NASA also had a big announcement  and President Clinton gave a press conference  about this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite. Except that nowadays  it's heavily disputed. If you take the lesson of all these pictures  then you realize  well actually maybe it's not that easy. Maybe I do need a definition of life in order to make that kind of distinction. So can life be defined  Well how would you go about it  Well of course  you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L. No  of course you don't do that  you put it somewhere in Google. And then you might get something. And what you might get    and anything that actually refers to things that we are used to  you throw away. And then you might come up with something like this. And it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts. Who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane  Oh  it's actually a really  really  important set of concepts. So I'm highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to  but in fact on processes only. And if you take a look at that  this was actually in a book that I wrote that deals with artificial life. And that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with. Because the idea was that  with concepts like that  maybe we can actually manufacture a form of life. And so if you go and ask yourself   What on Earth is artificial life    let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about. And it started out quite a while ago when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses. And for those of you who aren't old enough  you have no idea how this infection was working    namely  through these floppy disks. But the interesting thing about these computer virus infections was that  if you look at the rate at which the infection worked  they show this spiky behavior that you're used to from a flu virus. And it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth. And the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses  a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we're used to  at least on the viral level. So is that life  Not as far as I'm concerned. Why  Because these things don't evolve by themselves. In fact  they have hackers writing them. But the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further when a scientist working at the Scientific Institute decided   Why don't we try to package these little viruses in artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve   And this was Steen Rasmussen. And he designed this system  but it really didn't work  because his viruses were constantly destroying each other. But there was another scientist who had been watching this  an ecologist. And he went home and says   I know how to fix this.  And he wrote the Tierra system  and  in my book  is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems    except for the fact that these programs didn't really grow in complexity. So having seen this work  worked a little bit on this  this is where I came in. And I decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see the evolution of complexity  more and more complex problems constantly evolving. And of course  since I really don't know how to write code  I had help in this. I had two undergraduate students at California Institute of Technology that worked with me. That's Charles Offria on the left  Titus Brown on the right. They are now actually respectable professors at Michigan State University  but I can assure you  back in the day  we were not a respectable team. And I'm really happy that no photo survives of the three of us anywhere close together. But what is this system like  Well I can't really go into the details  but what you see here is some of the entrails. But what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure. There's about        programs sitting here. And all different strains are colored in different colors. And as you see here  there are groups that are growing on top of each other  because they are spreading. Any time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world  due to whatever mutation it has acquired  it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction. So I'm going to show you a movie where you're going to see that kind of dynamic. And these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves. We write our own stuff  replicate it  and are very proud of ourselves. And we put them in  and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation. By the way  this is highly accelerated  so it's like a thousand generations a second. But immediately the system goes like   What kind of dumb piece of code was this  This can be improved upon in so many ways so quickly.  So you see waves of new types taking over the other types. And this type of activity goes on for quite awhile  until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs. And then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation  like this one  which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before  until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved. And this process goes on and on and on. So what we see here is a system that lives in very much the way we're used to life  going.  But what the NASA people had asked me really was   Do these guys have a biosignature  Can we measure this type of life  Because if we can  maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids.  So I said   Well  perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process. In fact  it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be.  And the thing I came up with    I have to first give you an introduction about the idea  and maybe that would be a meaning detector  rather than a life detector. And the way we would do that    I would like to find out how I can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys  as opposed to text that  is  in our books. And I would like to do it in such a way that I don't actually have to be able to read the language  because I'm sure I won't be able to. As long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet. So here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the    letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys. And obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent. But if you now look at the same distribution in English texts  it looks like that. And I'm telling you  this is very robust across English texts. And if I look at French texts  it looks a little bit different  or Italian or German. They all have their own type of frequency distribution  but it's robust. It doesn't matter whether it writes about politics or about science. It doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text. It's a robust signature  and it's very stable. As long as our books are written in English    because people are rewriting them and recopying them    it's going to be there. So that inspired me to think about  well  what if I try to use this idea in order  not to detect random texts from texts with meaning  but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life. But first I have to ask  what are these building blocks  like the alphabet  elements that I showed you  Well it turns out  we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks. We could use amino acids  we could use nucleic acids  carboxylic acids  fatty acids. In fact  chemistry's extremely rich  and our body uses a lot of them. So that we actually  to test this idea  first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids. And here's the result. Here is  in fact  what you get if you  for example  look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar space or  in fact  in a laboratory  where you made very sure that in your primordial soup that there is not living stuff in there. What you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there's some trace elements of the other ones. That is also very robust    what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids  but there is no life. But suppose you take some dirt and dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers  because there's bacteria all over the place  or you take water anywhere on Earth  because it's teaming with life  and you make the same analysis  the spectrum looks completely different. Of course  there is still glycine and alanine  but in fact  there are these heavy elements  these heavy amino acids  that are being produced because these are valuable to the organism. And some other ones that are not used in the set of     they will not appear at all in any type of concentration. So this also turns out to be extremely robust. It doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up  whether it's bacteria or any other plants or animals. Anywhere there's life  you're going to have this distribution  as opposed to that distribution. And it is detectable not just in amino acids. Now you could ask  well  what about these Avidians  The Avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity. So this is the distribution that you get if  in fact  there is no life. They have about    of these instructions. And if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other  it's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter. Each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency. But if you now take a set of replicating guys like in the video that you saw  it looks like this. So there are some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms  and their frequency is going to be high. And there's actually some instructions that you only use once  if ever. So they are either poisonous or really should be used at less of a level than random. In this case  the frequency is lower. And so now we can see  is that really a robust signature  I can tell you indeed it is  because this type of spectrum  just like what you've seen in books  and just like what you've seen in amino acids  it doesn't really matter how you change the environment  it's very robust  it's going to reflect the environment. So I'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did. And I have to explain to you  the top of this graph shows you that frequency distribution that I talked about. Here  in fact  that's the lifeless environment where each instruction occurs at an equal frequency. And below there  I show  in fact  the mutation rate in the environment. And I'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that  even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world  if you drop it in  it gets mutated to death immediately. So there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate. But then I'm going to slowly turn down the heat  so to speak  and then there's this viability threshold where now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live. And indeed  we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time. So let's see what that looks like. So first  nothing  nothing  nothing. Too hot  too hot. Now the viability threshold is reached  and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and  in fact  stabilizes. And now what I did there is  I was being nasty  I just turned up the heat again and again. And of course  it reaches the viability threshold. And I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice. You hit the viability threshold. The distribution changes to  alive   And then  once you hit the threshold where the mutation rate is so high that you cannot self reproduce  you cannot copy the information forward to your offspring without making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes. And then that signature is lost. What do we learn from that  Well  I think we learn a number of things from that. One of them is  if we are able to think about life in abstract terms    and we're not talking about things like plants  and we're not talking about amino acids  and we're not talking about bacteria  but we think in terms of processes    then we could start to think about life  not as something that is so special to Earth  but that  in fact  could exist anywhere. Because it really only has to do with these concepts of information  of storing information within physical substrates    anything  bits  nucleic acids  anything that's an alphabet    and make sure that there's some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect the time scales for the deterioration of information. And if you can do that  then you have life. So the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone  without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear  as far as the type of life on Earth is. And that in a sense removes us again  like all of our scientific discoveries  or many of them    it's this continuous dethroning of man    of how we think we're special because we're alive. Well we can make life. We can make life in the computer. Granted  it's limited  but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it. And once we have that  then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say  if we understand the fundamental processes that do not refer to any particular substrate  then we can go out and try other worlds  figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be  figure enough about the normal chemistry  the geochemistry of the planet  so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life  and then look for large deviations from this    this thing sticking out  which says   This chemical really shouldn't be there.  Now we don't know that there's life then  but we could say   Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from.  And that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it. And so that's really the only take home message that I have for you. Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets. And if we remove the mystery of life  then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live  and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are. And I'm going to leave you with that. And thank you very much. What's in the box  Whatever it is must be pretty important  because I've traveled with it  moved it  from apartment to apartment to apartment. Sound familiar  Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did    years ago  Three times. So you'd think  with all this extra space  we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff. Nope. There's a new industry in town  a    billion dollar   .  billion sq. ft. industry  that of personal storage. So we've got triple the space  but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space. So where does this lead  Lots of credit card debt  huge environmental footprints  and perhaps not coincidentally  our happiness levels flat lined over the same    years. Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way  that less might actually equal more. I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less  college    in your dorm  traveling    in a hotel room  camping    rig up basically nothing  maybe a boat. Whatever it was for you  I bet that  among other things  this gave you a little more freedom  a little more time. So I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint. It's actually a great way to save you some money. And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area. First up  crowd sourcing my     sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com. I wanted it all    home office  sit down dinner for     room for guests  and all my kite surfing gear. With over     entries from around the world  I got it  my own little jewel box. By buying a space that was     sq. ft. instead of      immediately I'm saving     grand. Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities    save some more money there  but also a smaller footprint. And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions    my favorite stuff    and really designed for me  I'm really excited to be there. So how can you live little  Three main approaches. First of all  you have to edit ruthlessly. We've got to clear the arteries of our lives. And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years  It's time for me to let it go. We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives  and we've got to learn to stem the inflow. We need to think before we buy. Ask ourselves   Is that really going to make me happier  Truly   By all means  we should buy and own some great stuff. But we want stuff that we're going to love for years  not just stuff. Secondly  our new mantra  small is sexy. We want space efficiency. We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time  not that rare event. Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three  So we want things that nest  we want things that stack  and we want it digitized. You can take paperwork  books  movies  and you can make it disappear    it's magic. Finally  we want multifunctional spaces and housewares    a sink combined with a toilet  a dining table becomes a bed    same space  a little side table stretches out to seat   . In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here  we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space. Look at the coffee table    it grows in height and width to seat   . My office folds away  easily hidden. My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers. Guests  Move the moving wall  have some fold down guest beds. And of course  my own movie theater. So I'm not saying that we all need to live in     sq. ft. But consider the benefits of an edited life. Go from       to        from       to      . Most of us  maybe all of us  are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags  maybe a small space  a hotel room. So when you go home and you walk through your front door  take a second and ask yourselves   Could I do with a little life editing  Would that give me a little more freedom  Maybe a little more time   What's in the box  It doesn't really matter. I know I don't need it. What's in yours  Maybe  just maybe  less might equal more. So let's make room for the good stuff. Thank you. I'm a garbage man. And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man  because I absolutely hate waste. I hope  within the next    minutes  to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life. And I'd like to start at the very beginning. Think back when you were just a kid. How did look at the stuff in your life  Perhaps it was like these toddler rules  It's my stuff if I saw it first. The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something. The more stuff that's mine  the better. And of course  it's your stuff if it's broken. Well after spending about    years in the recycling industry  it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults. And let me tell you why I have that perspective. Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff. Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff  but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world    well less than one percent. In fact  the United Nations estimates that there's about    billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year    and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream. And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth  that number well more than doubles. And of course  the more developed the country  the bigger these mountains. Now when you see these mountains  most people think of garbage. We see above ground mines. And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place. And it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams. Because as we've heard all week at TED  the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff. And of course  they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted. And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day  It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals. And the metals  we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world. And the plastics  we get from oil  which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract. And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today. The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end of life stuff and starting to recycle our end of life stuff  particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner. Most of what's extracted from our end of life stuff  if it makes it to a recycler  are the metals. To put that in perspective    and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals  because it's the most common metal    if your stuff makes it to a recycler  probably over    percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose. Plastics are a whole other story  well less than    percent are recovered. In fact  it's more like five percent. Most of it's incinerated or landfilled. Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw away material  have very little value. But actually  plastics are several times more valuable than steel. And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel. So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material  Well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another. They have very different densities. They have different electrical and magnetic properties. And they even have different colors. So it's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials. Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range. They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties. And any plastic can be any color  as you probably well know. So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics. Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world    and sadly to say  particularly from the United States  where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe    finds its way to developing countries for low cost recycling. People  for as little as a dollar a day  pick through our stuff. They extract what they can  which is mostly the metals    circuit boards and so forth    and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover  which is  again  mostly the plastics. Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here. And they extract the metals by hand. Now while this may be the low economic cost solution  this is certainly not the low environmental or human health and safety solution. I call this environmental arbitrage. And it's not fair  it's not safe and it's not sustainable. Now because the plastics are so plentiful    and by the way  those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics  obviously    but people do try to recover the plastics. This is just one example. This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai  India. They store the plastics on the roofs. They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these  and people try very hard to separate the plastics  by color  by shape  by feel  by any technique they can. And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the  burn and sniff  technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic. None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way. And by the way  please don't try this technique at home. So what are we to do about this space age material  at least what we used to call a space aged material  these plastics  Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke. So about    years ago  I literally started in my garage tinkering around  trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other  and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends  in the mining world actually  and in the plastics world  and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world. Because after all  we're doing above ground mining. And we eventually broke the code. This is the last frontier of recycling. It's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth. And we finally figured out how to do it. And in the process  we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics. The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals. You breakdown the molecules  you recombine them in very specific ways  to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day. We said  there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics. And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint  sustainable from an economic standpoint as well. Well a good place to start is with waste. It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil  and it's plentiful  as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs. And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them  we're using a mining approach to extract the materials. We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment. We have enormous energy savings. I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save    to    percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way. And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life  our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them. And we make a drop in replacement for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals. Our customers get to enjoy huge CO  savings. They get to close the loop with their products. And they get to make more sustainable products. In the short time period I have  I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this. It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits. They recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue    it's their waste    a very complex mixture of materials  but predominantly plastics. We take out the things that aren't plastics  such as the metals they missed  carpeting  foam  rubber  wood  glass  paper  you name it. Even an occasional dead animal  unfortunately. And it goes in the first part of our process here  which is more like traditional recycling. We're sieving the material  we're using magnets  we're using air classification. It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point. At the end of this process  we have a mixed plastic composite  many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics. This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process  and the really hard work  multi step separation process begins. We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail. We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics  not only by type  but by grade. And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic  one type  one grade. We then use optical sorting to color sort this material. We blend it in        lb. blending silos. We push that material to extruders where we melt it  push it through small die holes  make spaghetti like plastic strands. And we chop those strands into what are called pellets. And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry. This is the same material that you would get from oil. And today  we're producing it from your old stuff  and it's going right back into your new stuff. So now  instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke  you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products  in your office  or back at work in your home. And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic  replacing virgin plastic  to make their new products. So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life. We took our clues from mother nature. Mother nature wastes very little  reuses practically everything. And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer    that's a label I've always hated my entire life    and think of yourself as just using resources in one form  until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time. And finally  I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to   If it's broken  it's my stuff.  Thank you for your time. I am a conductor  and I'm here today to talk to you about trust. My job depends upon it. There has to be  between me and the orchestra  an unshakable bond of trust  born out of mutual respect  through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in. Now in the old days  conducting  music making  was less about trust and more  frankly  about coercion. Up to and around about the Second World War  conductors were invariably dictators    these tyrannical figures who would rehearse  not just the orchestra as a whole  but individuals within it  within an inch of their lives. But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on  music has moved on with it. We now have a more democratic view and way of making music    a two way street. I  as the conductor  have to come to the rehearsal with a cast iron sense of the outer architecture of that music  within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine. For myself  of course  I have to completely trust my body language. That's all I have at the point of sale. It's silent gesture. I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing. Ladies and gentlemen  the Scottish Ensemble. So in order for all this to work  obviously I have got to be in a position of trust. I have to trust the orchestra  and  even more crucially  I have to trust myself. Think about it  when you're in a position of not trusting  what do you do  You overcompensate. And in my game  that means you overgesticulate. You end up like some kind of rabid windmill. And the bigger your gesture gets  the more ill defined  blurry and  frankly  useless it is to the orchestra. You become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore  only ridicule. And I remember at the beginning of my career  again and again  on these dismal outings with orchestras  I would be going completely insane on the podium  trying to engender a small scale crescendo really  just a little upsurge in volume. Bugger me  they wouldn't give it to me. I spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms. And how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis who said   Conducting  Charles  is like holding a small bird in your hand. If you hold it too tightly  you crush it. If you hold it too loosely  it flies away.  I have to say  in those days  I couldn't really even find the bird. Now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me  in terms of music  has been my adventures in South Africa  the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view  but a country which  through its musical culture  has taught me one fundamental lesson  that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life giving trust. Back in       I had the opportunity to go to South Africa to form a new opera company. So I went out there  and I auditioned  mainly in rural township locations  right around the country. I heard about       singers and pulled together a company of    of the most jaw droppingly amazing young performers  the majority of whom were black  but there were a handful of white performers. Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period that one of those white performers had  in his previous incarnation  been a member of the South African police force. And in the last years of the old regime  he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community. Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room  the general atmosphere. Let's be under no illusions. In South Africa  the relationship most devoid of trust is that between a white policeman and the black community. So how do we recover from that  ladies and gentlemen  Simply through singing. We sang  we sang  we sang  and amazingly new trust grew  and indeed friendship blossomed. And that showed me such a fundamental truth  that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot. So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally. One of them was  Carmen.  We then thought we'd make a movie of  Carmen   which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha. The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa  which is a beautifully musical language  if you don't know it. It's called  U Carmen e Khayelitsha     literally  Carmen of Khayelitsha.  I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making. Something which I find utterly enchanting about South African music making is that it's so free. South Africans just make music really freely. And I think  in no small way  that's due to one fundamental fact  they're not bound to a system of notation. They don't read music. They trust their ears. You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat. And then  as if by magic  they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune because they can. Now those of us that live in the West  if I can use that term  I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music    that somehow it's all about skill and systems. Therefore it's the exclusive preserve of an elite  talented body. And yet  ladies and gentlemen  every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis. And if I can broaden this out for a second  I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity  with total confidence  about movies  probably about literature. But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music  Why is this  And what I'm going to say to you now is I'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self confidence  to take the plunge  to believe that you can trust your ears  you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue  fiber  DNA  what makes a great piece of music great. I've got a little experiment I want to try with you. Did you know that TED is a tune  A very simple tune based on three notes    T  E  D. Now hang on a minute. I know you're going to say to me   T doesn't exist in music.  Well ladies and gentlemen  there's a time honored system  which composers have been using for hundreds of years  which proves actually that it does. If I sing you a musical scale  A  B  C  D  E  F  G    and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet  same scale  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T    there you go. T  see it's the same as F in music. So T is F. So T  E  D is the same as F  E  D. Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme  which is TED. Have a listen. Do you hear it  Or do I smell some doubt in the room  Okay  we'll play it for you again now  and we're going to highlight  we're going to poke out the T  E  D. If you'll pardon the expression. Oh my goodness me  there it was loud and clear  surely. I think we should make this even more explicit. Ladies and gentlemen  it's nearly time for tea. Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea  I think  I think we need to sing for our tea. We're going to sing those three wonderful notes  T  E  D. Will you have a go for me  Audience  T  E  D. Charles Hazlewood  Yeah  you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings. Shall we try that one again  And look  if you're adventurous  you go up the octave. T  E  D. Audience  T  E  D. CH  Once more with vim.  Audience  T  E  D.  There I am like a bloody windmill again  you see. Now we're going to put that in the context of the music. The music will start  and then at a signal from me  you will sing that. One more time  with feeling  ladies and gentlemen. You won't make the key otherwise. Well done  ladies and gentlemen. It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir  not a bad debut at all. Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment that I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you  because it is all about changing perceptions  and  indeed  building a new level of trust. The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy  which as you can imagine  if you don't have an experience of it yourself  is quite a big thing to take on board. But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me  aside from her very existence  is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden  the community of disabled people. And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting achievement. Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth  which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust  to really believe that disability and sports can go together in a convincing and interesting fashion. So I find myself asking  where is music in all of this  You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people  in the U.K. alone  with massive musical potential. So I decided to create a platform for that potential. It's going to be Britain's first ever national disabled orchestra. It's called Paraorchestra. I'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had. It was a really extraordinary moment. Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians. Normally when you improvise    and I do it all the time around the world    there's this initial period of horror  like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring  an awful pregnant silence. Then suddenly  as if by magic  bang  We're all in there and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything. No one's listening. No one's trusting. No one's responding to each other. Now in this room with these four disabled musicians  within five minutes a rapt listening  a rapt response and some really insanely beautiful music. Nicholas   My name's Nicholas McCarthy. I'm     and I'm a left handed pianist. And I was born without my left hand    right hand. Can I do that one again  Lyn  When I'm making music  I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane. I become alive. Clarence  I would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk. There's so much joy and things I could get from playing an instrument and performing. It's removed some of my paralysis. CH  I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today  so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are. Paraorchestra is the name of that project. If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point  please let me know. Now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn  wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the   th century    spent the bulk of his life in the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy  along with his orchestra. Now this prince loved his music  but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time  which is just on the Austro Hungarian border  a place called Esterhazy    a long way from the big city of Vienna. Now one day in       the prince decreed that the musicians' families  the orchestral musicians' families  were no longer welcome in the castle. They weren't allowed to stay there anymore  they had to be returned to Vienna    as I say  an unfeasibly long way away in those days. You can imagine  the musicians were disconsolate. Haydn remonstrated with the prince  but to no avail. So given the prince loved his music  Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point. And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now. And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt. I'm pleased to say  the prince did take the tip from the orchestral performance  and the musicians were reunited with their families. But I think it sums up my talk rather well  this  that where there is trust  there is music    by extension life. Where there is no trust  the music quite simply withers away. What is going on in this baby's mind  If you'd asked people this    years ago  most people  including psychologists  would have said that this baby was irrational  illogical  egocentric    that he couldn't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect. In the last    years  developmental science has completely overturned that picture. So in some ways  we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists. Let me give you just one example of this. One thing that this baby could be thinking about  that could be going on in his mind  is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby. After all  one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling. And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel. Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get. We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people. Now the question is  How could we ask them  Babies  after all  can't talk  and if you ask a three year old to tell you what he thinks  what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that. So how do we actually ask them the question  Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli. What we did    Betty Rapacholi  who was one of my students  and I    was actually to give the babies two bowls of food  one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers. Now all of the babies  even in Berkley  like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli. But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl. And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't. So half the time  she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli    just like a baby and any other sane person. But half the time  what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go   Mmmmm  broccoli. I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm.  And then she would take a little bit of the crackers  and she'd go   Eww  yuck  crackers. I tasted the crackers. Eww  yuck.  So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted. We did this with    and    month old babies. And then she would simply put her hand out and say   Can you give me some   So the question is  What would the baby give her  what they liked or what she liked  And the remarkable thing was that    month old babies  just barely walking and talking  would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers  but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli. On the other hand     month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli  like they couldn't figure this out. But then after they stared for a long time  they would just give her the crackers  what they thought everybody must like. So there are two really remarkable things about this. The first one is that these little    month old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature  that we don't always want the same thing. And what's more  they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted. Even more remarkably though  the fact that    month olds didn't do this suggests that these    month olds had learned this deep  profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were    months old. So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought. And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last    years that's actually demonstrated it. The question you might ask though is  Why do children learn so much  And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time  I mean  after all  if you look at babies superficially  they seem pretty useless. And actually in many ways  they're worse than useless  because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive. But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies  it turns out that there's actually an answer. If we look across many  many different species of animals  not just us primates  but also including other mammals  birds  even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats  it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are. And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there. On one side is a New Caledonian crow. And crows and other corvidae  ravens  rooks and so forth  are incredibly smart birds. They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects. And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food. On the other hand  we have our friend the domestic chicken. And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps. So they're very  very good at pecking for grain  and they're not much good at doing anything else. Well it turns out that the babies  the New Caledonian crow babies  are fledglings. They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years  which is a really long time in the life of a bird. Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months. So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot. There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning. Well what kind of explanation could we have for this  Well some animals  like the chicken  seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well. So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment. Other creatures  like the crows  aren't very good at doing anything in particular  but they're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments. And of course  we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows. We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal. We're smarter  we're more flexible  we can learn more  we survive in more different environments  we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space. And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species. My son is   . And at least until they're     we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths. All right  why would we see this correlation  Well an idea is that that strategy  that learning strategy  is an extremely powerful  great strategy for getting on in the world  but it has one big disadvantage. And that one big disadvantage is that  until you actually do all that learning  you're going to be helpless. So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself   A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better   You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up. And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor. So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected. We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn. And then as adults  we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world. So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species. So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas  and we're production and marketing. We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use. Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups  we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species    kind of like caterpillars and butterflies    except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring  and we're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow  grownup  adult path. If this is true  if these babies are designed to learn    and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning  that's what they're for    we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms. And in fact  the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet. But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better. And there's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently. And it all depends on the ideas of this guy  the Reverend Thomas Bayes  who was a statistician and mathematician in the   th century. And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize  describe  the way that scientists find out about the world. So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with. They go out and test it against the evidence. The evidence makes them change that hypothesis. Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth. And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that. And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now. And some    years ago  I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing. So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes  I think it actually looks something like this. This is Reverend Bayes's notebook. So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works. All right  now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate. Because after all  if you ask even grownups about statistics  they look extremely stupid. How could it be that children are doing statistics  So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector. This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others. And using this very simple machine  my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world. Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner  my student. If I showed you this detector  you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector. But actually  this detector works in a bit of a strange way. Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector  something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with  the detector will actually activate two out of three times. Whereas  if you do the likely thing  put the block on the detector  it will only activate two out of six times. So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence. It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy. So we did just this  we gave four year olds this pattern of evidence  and we just asked them to make it go. And sure enough  the four year olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector. Now there are two things that are really interesting about this. The first one is  again  remember  these are four year olds. They're just learning how to count. But unconsciously  they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure. And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea  get to a hypothesis about the world  that seems very unlikely to begin with. And in studies we've just been doing in my lab  similar studies  we've show that four year olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task. So in these circumstances  the children are using statistics to find out about the world  but after all  scientists also do experiments  and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments. When children do experiments we call it  getting into everything  or else  playing.  And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program. Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab. What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors. And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't  and then she showed them an anomaly. And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes. Same as the other side. Alison Gopnik  Okay  so his first hypothesis has just been falsified. Boy  This one lighted up  and this one nothing. AG  Okay  he's got his experimental notebook out. Boy  What's making this light up. I don't know. AG  Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair. Boy  Oh  it's because this needs to be like this  and this needs to be like this. AG  Okay  hypothesis two. Boy  That's why. Oh. AG  Now this is his next idea. He told the experimenter to do this  to try putting it out onto the other location. Not working either. Boy  Oh  because the light goes only to here  not here. Oh  the bottom of this box has electricity in here  but this doesn't have electricity. AG  Okay  that's a fourth hypothesis. Boy  It's lighting up. So when you put four. So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up. AG  Okay there's his fifth hypothesis. Now that is a particularly    that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy  but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical. If you look at the way children play  when you ask them to explain something  what they really do is do a series of experiments. This is actually pretty typical of four year olds. Well  what's it like to be this kind of creature  What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes  Well  if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers  a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all. And I think just the opposite is true. I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults. Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works. And adults' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight. So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important  we should pay attention to it. Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid  and everything else sort of goes dark. And we even know something about the way the brain does this. So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex  the sort of executive part of our brains  sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible  more plastic  better at learning  and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains. So we have a very focused  purpose driven kind of attention. If we look at babies and young children  we see something very different. I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness. So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing. But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once. And if you actually look in their brains  you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity  and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet. So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention  what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention. So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important. That's the kind of attention  the kind of consciousness  that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn. Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults  I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before    when we fall in love with someone new  or when we're in a new city for the first time. And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts  it expands  so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking  talking  faculty meeting attending zombie back home. And by the way  that coffee  that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs  actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters. So what's it like to be a baby  It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double espressos. That's a fantastic way to be  but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning. Now it's good to be a grownup. I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are. It's good to be a grownup. We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves. And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do. But if what we want is to be like those butterflies  to have open mindedness  open learning  imagination  creativity  innovation  maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children. When I was little    and by the way  I was little once    my father told me a story about an   th century watchmaker. And what this guy had done  he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches. And one day  one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought. And the guy took it apart  and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels. And as he did so  his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving  were words. And he said to the guy   Why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see   And the watchmaker turned around and said   God can see it.  Now I'm not in the least bit religious  neither was my father  but at that point  I noticed something happening here. I felt something in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves  and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere  I guess. But I felt something. And it was a physiological response. And from that point on  from my age at the time  I began to think of things in a different way. And as I took on my career as a designer  I began to ask myself the simple question  Do we actually think beauty  or do we feel it  Now you probably know the answer to this already. You probably think  well  I don't know which one you think it is  but I think it's about feeling beauty. And so I then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things. One of the most early work was done in automotive design    some very exciting work was done there. And during a lot of this work  we found something  or I found something  that really fascinated me  and maybe you can remember it. Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off  click click  when you closed the door in a car  And then somebody  I think it was BMW  introduced a light that went out slowly. Remember that  I remember it clearly. Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that  I remember sitting there thinking  this is fantastic. In fact  I've never found anybody that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly. I thought  well what the hell's that about  So I started to ask myself questions about it. And the first was  I'd ask other people   Do you like it    Yes.   Why   And they'd say   Oh  it feels so natural   or   It's nice.  I thought  well that's not good enough. Can we cut down a little bit further  because  as a designer  I need the vocabulary  I need the keyboard  of how this actually works. And so I did some experiments. And I suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that    light to dark in six seconds    exactly that. Do you know what it is  Anyone  You see  using this bit  the thinky bit  the slow bit of the brain    using that. And this isn't a think  it's a feel. And would you do me a favor  For the next    minutes or whatever it is  will you feel stuff  I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it. I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation. And that thing that I found was the cinema or the theater. It's actually just happened here    light to dark in six seconds. And when that happens  are you sitting there going   No  the movie's about to start   or are you going   That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it. I get a sense of anticipation   Now I'm not a neuroscientist. I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex. But it might be. Because the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this. And some of the people I speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don't get it in the same way. Everybody likes it  but some like it more than others. So this leads me to think of this in a different way. We're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system    if that's not an outmoded idea. These are the bits  the pleasure centers  and maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking. The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit  the cortex. They arrive first. So how do we make that actually work  And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know  or what we're going to learn  about something  This is one of the most beautiful things I know. It's a plastic bag. And when I looked at it first  I thought  no  there's no beauty in that. Then I found out  post exposure  that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff  that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure  potable drinking water. And all of a sudden  this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me. Now I'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit. Would you mind taking the brain out  and I just want you to feel something. Look at that. What are you feeling about it  Is it beautiful  Is it exciting  I'm watching your faces very carefully. There's some rather bored looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged looking ladies who are picking up something off that. Maybe there's an innocence to it. Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready  This is the last act on this Earth of a little girl called Heidi  five years old  before she died of cancer to the spine. It's the last thing she did  the last physical act. Look at that picture. Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it. Is it beautiful now  Stop. Stop. How do you feel  Where are you feeling this  I'm feeling it here. I feel it here. And I'm watching your faces  because your faces are telling me something. The lady over there is actually crying  by the way. But what are you doing  I watch what people do. I watch faces. I watch reactions. Because I have to know how people react to things. And one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty  something stupefyingly delicious  is what I call the OMG. And by the way  there's no pleasure in that face. It's not a  this is wonderful   The eyebrows are doing this  the eyes are defocused  and the mouth is hanging open. That's not the expression of joy. There's something else in that. There's something weird happening. So pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in. Poignancy is a word I love as a designer. It means something triggering a big emotional response  often quite a sad emotional response  but it's part of what we do. It isn't just about nice. And this is the dilemma  this is the paradox  of beauty. Sensorily  we're taking in all sorts of things    mixtures of things that are good  bad  exciting  frightening    to come up with that sensorial exposure  that sensation of what's going on. Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing. And also triumph  this sense of transcendence  this  I never knew that. Ah  this is something new.  And that's packed in there as well. And as we assemble these tools  from a design point of view  I get terribly excited about it  because these are things  as we've already said  they're arriving at the brain  it would seem  before cognition  before we can manipulate them    electrochemical party tricks. Now what I'm also interested in is  Is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty  By that  I mean intrinsically beautiful things  just something that's exquisitely beautiful  that's universally beautiful. Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it. Very hard to find something that  to everybody  is a very beautiful thing  without a certain amount of information packed in there before. So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic. It's mediated by information before the comprehension. Or the information's added on at the back  like that little girl's drawing that I showed you. Now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you. And one of the most tedious ones  I think  was saying that beauty was about symmetry. Well it obviously isn't. This is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people  and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face. And they found that it was almost exact coincidence. So it wasn't about symmetry. In fact  this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face  of which both sides are beautiful. But they're both different. And as a designer  I can't help meddling with this  so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this  and tried to understand what the individual elements were  but feeling it as I go. Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye. I'm not getting it off the eyebrow. And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all. So I don't know how much this is helping me  but it's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off. And as I say  I'm not a neuroscientist  but to understand how I can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements. Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are  but as we are. So I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you  which is beautiful to me. And this is the F  MV Agusta. Ahhhh. It is really    I mean  I can't express to you how exquisite this object is. But I also know why it's exquisite to me  because it's a palimpsest of things. It's masses and masses of layers. This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension. It's something much bigger. Layer after layer of legend  sport  details that resonate. I mean  if I just go through some of them now    I know about laminar flow when it comes to air piercing objects  and that does it consummately well  you can see it can. So that's getting me excited. And I feel that here. This bit  the big secret of automotive design    reflection management. It's not about the shapes  it's how the shapes reflect light. Now that thing  light flickers across it as you move  so it becomes a kinetic object  even though it's standing still    managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection. This little relief on the footplate  by the way  to a rider means there's something going on underneath it    in this case  a drive chain running at     miles and hour probably  taking the power from the engine. I'm getting terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things. Titanium lacquer on this. I can't tell you how wonderful this is. That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel. I'm really getting into this now. And of course  a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand  but this one  because it's a road bike  it all goes away and it folds into this little gap. So it disappears. And then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator  which is curved. Why would you do that  Because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics. So it's more expensive  but it's wonderful. And to cap it all  brand royalty    Agusta  Count Agusta  from the great histories of this stuff. The bit that you can't see is the genius that created this. Massimo Tamburini. They call him  The Plumber  in Italy  as well as  Maestro   because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time. There's so little compromise on this  you can't see it. But unfortunately  the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty. We have to deal with it. So I have to work with a supply chain  and I've got to work with the technologies  and I've got to work with everything else all the time  and so compromises start to fit into it. And so look at her. I've had to make a bit of a compromise there. I've had to move that part across  but only a millimeter. No one's noticed  have they yet  Did you see what I did  I moved three things by a millimeter. Pretty  Yes. Beautiful  Maybe lesser. But then  of course  the consumer says that doesn't really matter. So that's okay  isn't it  Another millimeter  No one's going to notice those split lines and changes. It's that easy to lose beauty  because beauty's incredibly difficult to do. And only a few people can do it. And a focus group cannot do it. And a team rarely can do it. It takes a central cortex  if you like  to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time. This is a beautiful water bottle    some of you know of it    done by Ross Lovegrove  the designer. This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one  as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this. It's lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious. I might like it more than you like it  because I know how bloody hard it is to do it. It's stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that  that comes out of the tool correctly  that goes down the line without falling over. Underneath this  like the story of the swan  is a million things very difficult to do. So all hail to that. It's a fantastic example  a simple object. And the one I showed you before was  of course  a massively complex one. And they're working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it. You all  I guess  like me  enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance. And part of the joy of it is  you know the difficulty. You also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful. Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes when they come out of the points  While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you  something horrible's going on down here. The comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what's actually going on. Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here  so please ignore me. But what I have to do now  feeling again  what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes  of these triggers into something early on in the process  that you pick it up  not through your thinking  but through your feeling. So we're going to have a little experiment. Right  are you ready  I'm going to show you something for a very  very brief moment. Are you ready  Okay. Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash  It's not. Tell me something  did you think it was quick when you first saw it  Yes you did. Did you think it was modern  Yes you did. That blip  that information  shot into you before that. And because your brain starter motor began there  now it's got to deal with it. And the great thing is  this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it's green technology and it's good for you and it's light and it's all part of the future. So is that wrong  Well in this case it isn't  because it's a very  very ecologically sound piece of technology. But you're a slave of that first flash. We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second    and that's where much of my work has to win or lose  on a shelf in a shop. It wins or loses at that point. You may see              things on a shelf as you walk down it  but I have to work within that domain  to ensure that it gets you there first. And finally  the layer that I love  of knowledge. Some of you  I'm sure  will be familiar with this. What's incredible about this  and the way I love to come back to it  is this is taking something that you hate or bores you  folding clothes  and if you can actually do this    who can actually do this  Anybody try to do this  Yeah  It's fantastic  isn't it  Look at that. Do you want to see it again  No time. It says I have two minutes left  so we can't do this. But just go to the Web  YouTube  pull it down   folding T shirt.  That's how underpaid younger aged people have to fold your T shirt. You didn't maybe know it. But how do you feel about it  It feels fantastic when you do it  you look forward to doing it  and when you tell somebody else about it    like you probably have    you look really smart. The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside  the stuff that costs nothing  because that knowledge is free    bundle that together and where do we come out  Form follows function  Only sometimes. Only sometimes. Form is function. Form is function. It informs  it tells us  it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it. And so I've stopped using words like  form   and I've stopped using words like  function  as a designer. What I try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things. Because if I can get that right  I can make them wonderful  and I can make them repeatedly wonderful. And you know what those products and services are  because you own some of them. They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire. Forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it. Thank you very much. Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing  broadcasting  commerce and social connectivity  but where did it all come from  And I'll quote three people  Vannevar Bush  Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners Lee. So let's just run through these guys. This is Vannevar Bush. Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war. And in       he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly. And the article was called  As We May Think.  And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken. We don't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth. The brain works by association. With one item in its thought  it snaps instantly to the next item. And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process. And so he suggested a machine  and he called it the memex. And the memex would link information  one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth. Now this was in     . A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking. And nobody knew anything about it. So this was before the computer was invented. And he proposed this machine called the memex. And he had a platform where you linked information to other information  and then you could call it up at will. So spinning forward  one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart  and he was a U.S. Air Force officer. And he was reading it in their library in the Far East. And he was so inspired by this article  it kind of directed the rest of his life. And by the mid   s  he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California. He built a system. The system was designed to augment human intelligence  it was called. And in a premonition of today's world of cloud computing and softwares of service  his system was called NLS for oN Line System. And this is Doug Engelbart. He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in     . What he showed    he sat on a stage like this  and he demonstrated this system. He had his head mic like I've got. And he works this system. And you can see  he's working between documents and graphics and so forth. And he's driving it all with this platform here  with a five finger keyboard and the world's first computer mouse  which he specially designed in order to do this system. So this is where the mouse came from as well. So this is Doug Engelbart. The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds. So for a personal computer  a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane  it wasn't really very practical. But spin on to the   s when personal computers did arrive  then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers. And my company  OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh. And we delivered the world's first hypertext system. And this began to get a head of steam. Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard  and they made a bit of a fuss about it. They had a    page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched. The magazines started to cover it. Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext. We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version. And our PC version became quite mature. These are some examples of this system in action in the late   s. You were able to deliver documents  were able to do it over networks. We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html. We called it hml  hypertext markup language. And the system was capable of doing very  very large documentation systems over computer networks. So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November     . And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners Lee who said   Are you Ian Ritchie   and I said   Yeah.  And he said   I need to talk to you.  And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web. And I thought  well  that's got a pretentious name  especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office. But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day. And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it  because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything  it was just plain text. I thought  well  you know  interesting  but a guy from CERN  he's not going to do this. So we didn't do it. In the next couple of years  the hypertext community didn't recognize him either. In       his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference. In       there was a table at the conference in Seattle  and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web. And I saw it  and I thought  yep  that's it. And the very next year  in       we had the conference here in Edinburgh  and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners Lee as the keynote speaker. So that puts me in pretty illustrious company. There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles. There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC  and he wasn't there  so they went back to see Bill Gates. And the    publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter  I guess. On the other hand  there's Marc Andreessen who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web. And according to Fortune magazine  he's worth     million dollars. But is he happy  Okay  now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room  but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar. Also  the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars  how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking  and ultimately to trust building. Now  speaking of trust  ever since I wrote this book   Liespotting   no one wants to meet me in person anymore  no  no  no  no  no. They say   It's okay  we'll email you.  I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like   Honey  deception  Maybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking   So before I get started  what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you  which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids  those kids in the back of the room that are shouting   Gotcha  Gotcha  Your eyebrow twitched. You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.' I know you're lying.  No  liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth  and they do what mature leaders do everyday  they have difficult conversations with difficult people  sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path by accepting a core proposition  and that proposition is the following  Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it  a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love  but look  if at some point you got lied to  it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying  Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity  maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret  secret. We say   Nice song.   Honey  you don't look fat in that  no.  Or we say  favorite of the digiratti   You know  I just fished that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry.  But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw     billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States. That's an eyelash under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron  Madoff  the mortgage crisis. Or in the case of double agents and traitors  like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames  lies can betray our country  they can compromise our security  they can undermine democracy  they can cause the deaths of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man  Henry Oberlander  he was such an effective con man  British authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google  you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once  and he said the following. He said   Look  I've got one rule.  And this was Henry's rule  he said   Look  everyone is willing to give you something. They're ready to give you something for whatever it is they're hungry for.  And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be deceived  you have to know  what is it that you're hungry for  And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were better husbands  better wives  smarter  more powerful  taller  richer    the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap  to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were  how we wish we could be  with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day  studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from    to     times. Now granted  many of those are white lies. But in another study  it showed that strangers lied three times within the first    minutes of meeting each other. Now when we first hear this data  we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely  the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple  you're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every    interactions. Now  you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried  that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as needed basis  sometimes for very good reasons  other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying  but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture  it's part of our history. Think Dante  Shakespeare  the Bible  News of the World. Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species  the larger the neocortex  the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language  Koko was taught to communicate via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little  fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall. We're hardwired to become leaders of the pack. It's starts really  really early. How early  Well babies will fake a cry  pause  wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One year olds learn concealment. Two year olds bluff. Five year olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine year olds  masters of the cover up. By the time you enter college  you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners  we enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam  fake digital friends  partisan media  ingenious identity thieves  world class Ponzi schemers  a deception epidemic    in short  what one author calls a post truth society. It's been very confusing for a long time now. What do you do  Well  there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth    percent of the time. The rest of us  we're only    percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn  There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman  Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie  not a single time  never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the American people. Thank you. Pamela Meyer  Okay  what were the telltale signs  Well first we heard what's known as a non contracted denial. Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language. We also heard distancing language   that woman.  We know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject  using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said   Well  to tell you the truth ...  or Richard Nixon's favorite   In all candor ...  he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language  as it's called  qualifying language like that  further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety  or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail    and we're all really glad he didn't do that    he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said  look  there's much more to it than speech   No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent  he chatters with his fingertips.  And we all do it no matter how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. Now this brings us to our next pattern  which is body language. With body language  here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars fidget all the time. Well guess what  they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what  they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles convey honesty  sincerity. But a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here  You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes  the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted  especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox  nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening in a conversation  Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words and someone's actions  Now  I know it seems really obvious  but when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception  attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators. An honest person is going to be cooperative. They're going to show they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing to brainstorm  name suspects  provide details. They're going to say   Hey  maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks.  They're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview  not just in flashes  they'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks  an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn  look down  lower their voice  pause  be kind of herky jerky. Ask a deceptive person to tell their story  they're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours  they will ask that person to tell that story backwards  and then they'll watch them squirm  and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that  Well  we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words  but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say  yes   we shake our heads  no.  We tell very convincing stories  we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes  and we smile at the delight in getting away with it. Now  that smile is known in the trade as  duping delight.  And we're going to see that in several videos moving forward  but we're going to start    for those of you who don't know him  this is presidential candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him saying   yes  while shaking his head  no   slightly shrugging his shoulders. I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine  because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test  and would love to see it happen. Interviewer  Are you going to do that soon  Is there somebody    JE  Well  I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM  Okay  those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner might shake your hand  celebrate  go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here  but there's one I can teach you that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn  and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger  you've got two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt  you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason  it's very  very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt  whether or not deception follows    and it doesn't always follow    look the other way  go the other direction  reconsider the deal  say   No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you.  Science has surfaced many  many more indicators. We know  for example  we know liars will shift their blink rate  point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone  often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything in and of themselves. But when you see clusters of them  that's your signal. Look  listen  probe  ask some hard questions  get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing  walk into curiosity mode  ask more questions  have a little dignity  treat the person you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks on  Law   Order  and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects into submission. Don't be too aggressive  it doesn't work. Now  we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised  we're now going to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos  two mothers    one is lying  one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example of what the truth looks like. This mother  Diane Downs  shot her kids at close range  drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car  claimed a scraggy haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video  she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very  very cool demeanor. And if you look closely  you'll see duping delight throughout this video. I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving  and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth. And that    maybe it'll fade too with time    but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM  Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother  Erin Runnion  confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion  just the authentic expression of a mother's agony. on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby  and you hurt her  and you crushed her  you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought  and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes  and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it  and I never will. PM  Okay  there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on  the science of it. We know  for example  that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans  MRI's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit  and they will prove incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself in the meantime  Who do you want on your side of the meeting  someone who's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag a     pound electroencephalogram through the door  Liespotters rely on human tools. They know  as someone once said   Character's who you are in the dark.  And what's kind of interesting is that today  we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up    hours a day. It's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember  oversharing  that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency    character integrity    that's still what matters  that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world  it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code. When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking  listening  you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit  because you signal to everyone around you  you say   Hey  my world  our world  it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized.  And when you do that  the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. So I'm here to explain why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas. And to do that  I'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies. So some of you may know about the chemical Bisphenol A  BPA. It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics. So BPA mimics the body's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems. And it's everywhere. A recent study found BPA in    percent of people six and older. But it's just one chemical. The Center for Disease Control in the U.S. says we have     toxic pollutants in our bodies  and this includes preservatives  pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury. To me  this says three things. First  don't become a cannibal. Second  we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution. And third  our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins. So what happens to all these toxins when we die  The short answer is  They return to the environment in one way or another  continuing the cycle of toxicity. But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse. If you're cremated  all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere. And this includes       pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year. And in a traditional American funeral  a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive. It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition    a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel. So by trying to preserve our dead bodies  we deny death  poison the living and further harm the environment. Green or natural burials  which don't use embalming  are a step in the right direction  but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies. I think there's a better solution. I'm an artist  so I'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art  science and culture. The Infinity Burial Project  an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies. The Infinity Burial Project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the Infinity Mushroom    a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies  clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots  leaving clean compost. But I learned it's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom. I also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil. So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body. So today  I'm collecting what I shed or slough off    my hair  skin and nails    and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms. As the mushrooms grow  I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms. It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife. So when I die  the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it. All right  so for some of you  this may be really  really out there. Just a little. I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food. We want to eat  not be eaten by  our food. But as I watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body  I imagine the Infinity Mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment. See for me  cultivating the Infinity Mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet  it's a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay. It's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet. Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture  a concept that was developed by an entomologist  Timothy Myles. The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation    the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies. And now about these ninja pajamas. Once it's completed  I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects. First  a burial suit infused with mushroom spores  the Mushroom Death Suit. I'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit. It's covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores. The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia  which are the equivalent of plant roots. I'm also making a decompiculture kit  a cocktail of capsules that contain Infinity Mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation. These capsules are embedded in a nutrient rich jelly  a kind of second skin  which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms. So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two  and then I'd like to begin testing them  first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects. And believe it or not  a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms. What I've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment. I wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms  so I formed the Decompiculture Society  a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options  seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the Infinity Mushroom. The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift  from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture  a radical acceptance of death and decomposition. Accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment  as the research on environmental toxins confirms. And the saying goes  we came from dust and will return to dust. And once we understand that we're connected to the environment  we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet. I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility. Thank you. I'd like to take you to another world. And I'd like to share a    year old love story with the poor  living on less than one dollar a day. I went to a very elitist  snobbish  expensive education in India  and that almost destroyed me. I was all set to be a diplomat  teacher  doctor    all laid out. Then  I don't look it  but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years. The whole world was laid out for me. Everything was at my feet. I could do nothing wrong. And then I thought out of curiosity I'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like. So in       I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India  and I saw starvation  death  people dying of hunger  for the first time. It changed my life. I came back home  told my mother   I'd like to live and work in a village.  Mother went into a coma.  What is this  The whole world is laid out for you  the best jobs are laid out for you  and you want to go and work in a village  I mean  is there something wrong with you   I said   No  I've got the best eduction. It made me think. And I wanted to give something back in my own way.   What do you want to do in a village  No job  no money  no security  no prospect.  I said   I want to live and dig wells for five years.   Dig wells for five years  You went to the most expensive school and college in India  and you want to dig wells for five years   She didn't speak to me for a very long time  because she thought I'd let my family down. But then  I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have  which are never brought into the mainstream    which is never identified  respected  applied on a large scale. And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College    college only for the poor. What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college. I went to this village for the first time. Elders came to me and said   Are you running from the police   I said   No.   You failed in your exam   I said   No.   You didn't get a government job   I said   No.   What are you doing here  Why are you here  The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich  what are you doing in this village  Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us   I said   No  I want to actually start a college only for the poor. What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college.  So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice. They said   Please  don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college.  So it's the only college in India where  if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's  you are disqualified to come. You have to be a cop out or a wash out or a dropout to come to our college. You have to work with your hands. You have to have a dignity of labor. You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community. So we started the Barefoot College  and we redefined professionalism. Who is a professional  A professional is someone who has a combination of competence  confidence and belief. A water diviner is a professional. A traditional midwife is a professional. A traditional bone setter is a professional. These are professionals all over the world. You find them in any inaccessible village around the world. And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal. It needs to be used  needs to be applied  needs to be shown to the world outside    that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today. So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi. You eat on the floor  you sleep on the floor  you work on the floor. There are no contracts  no written contracts. You can stay with me for    years  go tomorrow. And no one can get more than      a month. You come for the money  you don't come to Barefoot College. You come for the work and the challenge  you'll come to the Barefoot College. That is where we want you to try crazy ideas. Whatever idea you have  come and try it. It doesn't matter if you fail. Battered  bruised  you start again. It's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher. And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate. You are certified by the community you serve. You don't need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer. So when I said that  they said   Well show us what is possible. What are you doing  This is all mumbo jumbo if you can't show it on the ground.  So we built the first Barefoot College in     . It was built by    Barefoot architects who can't read and write  built on   .   a sq. ft.     people lived there  worked there. They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in     . But then they suspected  they thought there was an architect behind it. I said   Yes  they made the blueprints  but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college.  We are the only ones who actually returned the award for          because they didn't believe us  and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia. I asked a forester    high powered  paper qualified expert    I said   What can you build in this place   He had one look at the soil and said   Forget it. No way. Not even worth it. No water  rocky soil.  I was in a bit of a spot. And I said   Okay  I'll go to the old man in village and say  'What should I grow in this spot '  He looked quietly at me and said   You build this  you build this  you put this  and it'll work.  This is what it looks like today. Went to the roof  and all the women said   Clear out. The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men. This is waterproofing the roof.  It is a bit of jaggery  a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know. But it actually doesn't leak. Since       it hasn't leaked. This technology  the women will not share with the men. It's the only college which is fully solar electrified. All the power comes from the sun.    kilowatts of panels on the roof. And everything works off the sun for the next    years. So long as the sun shines  we'll have no problem with power. But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest  a Hindu priest  who's only done eight years of primary schooling    never been to school  never been to college. He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed. Food  if you come to the Barefoot College  is solar cooked. But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women  illiterate women  who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker. It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker. Unfortunately  they're almost half German  they're so precise. You'll never find Indian women so precise. Absolutely to the last inch  they can make that cooker. And we have    meals twice a day of solar cooking. We have a dentist    she's a grandmother  illiterate  who's a dentist. She actually looks after the teeth of       children. Barefoot technology  this was         no engineer  no architect thought of it    but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs. Very little water is wasted. All the roofs are connected underground to a         liter tank  and no water is wasted. If we have four years of drought  we still have water on the campus  because we collect rainwater.    percent of children don't go to school  because they have to look after animals    sheep  goats    domestic chores. So we thought of starting a school at night for the children. Because the night schools of Tilonia  over        children have gone through these night schools. Because it's for the convenience of the child  it's not for the convenience of the teacher. And what do we teach in these schools  Democracy  citizenship  how you should measure your land  what you should do if you're arrested  what you should do if your animal is sick. This is what we teach in the night schools. But all the schools are solar lit. Every five years we have an election. Between six to    year old children participate in a democratic process  and they elect a prime minister. The prime minister is    years old. She looks after    goats in the morning  but she's prime minister in the evening. She has a cabinet  a minister of education  a minister for energy  a minister for health. And they actually monitor and supervise     schools for       children. She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago  and she went to Sweden. First time ever going out of her village. Never seen Sweden. Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening. And the Queen of Sweden  who's there  turned to me and said   Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from  She's only    years old  and she's not dazzled by anything.  And the girl  who's on her left  turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said   Please tell her I'm the prime minister.  Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high  we use puppetry. Puppets is the way we communicate. You have Jokhim Chacha who is     years old. He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher. He's my doctor. He's my lawyer. He's my donor. He actually raises money  solves my disputes. He solves my problems in the village. If there's tension in the village  if attendance at the schools goes down and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent  the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says   Shake hands. The attendance must not drop.  These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports. So this decentralized  demystified approach of solar electrifying villages  we've covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan    all solar electrified villages by people who have been trained. And we went to Ladakh  and we asked this woman    this  at minus     you have to come out of the roof  because there's no place  it was all snowed up on both sides    and we asked this woman   What was the benefit you had from solar electricity   And she thought for a minute and said   It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter.  Went to Afghanistan. One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable. Men are restless  men are ambitious  men are compulsively mobile  and they all want a certificate. All across the globe  you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate. Why  Because they want to leave the village and go to a city  looking for a job. So we came up with a great solution  train grandmothers. What's the best way of communicating in the world today  Television  No. Telegraph  No. Telephone  No. Tell a woman. So we went to Afghanistan for the first time  and we picked three women and said   We want to take them to India.  They said   Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms  and you want to take them to India.  I said   I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well.  So I took the husbands along. Of course  the women were much more intelligent than the men. In six months  how do we train these women  Sign language. You don't choose the written word. You don't choose the spoken word. You use sign language. And in six months they can become solar engineers. They go back and solar electrify their own village. This woman went back and solar electrified the first village  set up a workshop    the first village ever to be solar electrified in Afghanistan  was  by the three women. This woman is an extraordinary grandmother.    years old  and she's solar electrified     houses for me in Afghanistan. And they haven't collapsed. She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC. He didn't know. Those three women have trained    more women and solar electrified     villages in Afghanistan. We went to Africa  and we did the same thing. All these women sitting at one table from eight  nine countries  all chatting to each other  not understanding a word  because they're all speaking a different language. But their body language is great. They're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers. I went to Sierra Leone  and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night    comes across this village. Comes back  goes into the village  says   Well what's the story   They said   These two grandmothers ...    Grandmothers   The minister couldn't believe what was happening.  Where did they go    Went to India and back.  Went straight to the president. He said   Do you know there's a solar electrified village in Sierra Leone   He said   No.  Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.  What's the story.  So he summoned me and said   Can you train me     grandmothers   I said   I can't  Mr. President. But they will. The grandmothers will.  So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone. And     grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone. Gambia  we went to select a grandmother in Gambia. Went to this village. I knew which woman I would like to take. The community got together and said   Take these two women.  I said   No  I want to take this woman.  They said   Why  She doesn't know the language. You don't know her.  I said   I like the body language. I like the way she speaks.   Difficult husband  not possible.  Called the husband  the husband came  swaggering  politician  mobile in his hand.  Not possible.   Why not    The woman  look how beautiful she is.  I said   Yeah  she is very beautiful.   What happens if she runs off with an Indian man   That was his biggest fear. I said   She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile.  She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger. She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran. She handled the national press  and she was a star. And when I went back six months later  I said   Where's your husband    Oh  somewhere. It doesn't matter.  Success story. I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside. Look for solutions within. And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you. They're all over the world. Don't even worry. Don't listen to the World Bank  listen to the people on the ground. They have all the solutions in the world. I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.  First they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  and then you win.  Thank you. Why can't we solve these problems  We know what they are. Something always seems to stop us. Why  I remember March the   th      . The B   iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. In the newspaper it said  it was all part of a normal process.  A little bit further on in the article it said  a loss that would normally take the ice shelf        years to replace.  That same word   normal   had two different  almost opposite meanings. If we walk into the B   iceberg when we leave here today  we're going to bump into something a thousand feet tall     miles long     miles wide  and it's going to weigh two gigatons. I'm sorry  there's nothing normal about this. And yet I think it's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions. Only    days after this  arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred. It was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome. This is the code that's in every single one of our    trillion cells that makes us who we are and what we are. And if we just take one cell's worth of this code and unwind it  it's a meter long  two nanometers thick. Two nanometers is    atoms in thickness. And I wondered  what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places  where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms  And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy  the electron  So I started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists I could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there  and we formed a company to build on their extraordinary ideas. Six and a half years later  a hundred and eighty researchers  they have some amazing developments in the lab  and I will show you three of those today  such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead  we can generate all the energy we need right where we are  cleanly  safely  and cheaply. Think of the space that we spend most of our time. A tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun. We like the light that comes into the room  but in the middle of summer  all that heat is coming into the room that we're trying to keep cool. In winter  exactly the opposite is happening. We're trying to heat up the space that we're in  and all that is trying to get out through the window. Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in  One of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material  carbon  that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor  and when the vaporized carbon condenses  it condenses back into a different form  chickenwire rolled up. But this chickenwire carbon  called a carbon nanotube  is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs. It's a thousand times more conductive than copper. How is that possible  One of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently. You think of carbon as black. Carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible. And when it's in this form  if I combine it with a polymer and affix it to your window when it's in its colored state  it will reflect away all heat and light  and when it's in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between. To change its state  by the way  takes two volts from a millisecond pulse. And once you've changed its state  it stays there until you change its state again. As we were working on this incredible discovery at University of Florida  we were told to go down the corridor to visit another scientist  and he was working on a pretty incredible thing. Imagine if we didn't have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night. We'd have to see at night  right  This lets you do it. It's a nanomaterial  two nanomaterials  a detector and an imager. The total width of it is     times smaller than the width of a decimal place. And it takes all the infrared available at night  converts it into an electron in the space of two small films  and is enabling you to play an image which you can see through. I'm going to show to TEDsters  the first time  this operating. Firstly I'm going to show you the transparency. Transparency is key. It's a film that you can look through. And then I'm going to turn the lights out. And you can see  off a tiny film  incredible clarity. As we were working on this  it dawned on us  this is taking infrared radiation  wavelengths  and converting it into electrons. What if we combined it with this  Suddenly you've converted energy into an electron on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window. But because it's flexible  it can be on any surface whatsoever. The power plant of tomorrow is no power plant. We talked about generating and using. We want to talk about storing energy  and unfortunately the best thing we've got going is something that was developed in France a hundred and fifty years ago  the lead acid battery. In terms of dollars per what's stored  it's simply the best. Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power  we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas  and we gave them this diagram. It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas Fort Worth Airport. We said   Could you build this   And these scientists  instead of laughing at us  said   Yeah.  And what they built was eBox. EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside  hold it until you need it  and then be able to release it and pass it off. Being able to do that means that I can generate energy cleanly  efficiently and cheaply right where I am. It's my energy. And if I don't need it  I can convert it back up on the window to energy  light  and beam it  line of site  to your place. And for that I do not need an electric grid between us. The grid of tomorrow is no grid  and energy  clean efficient energy  will one day be free. If you do this  you get the last puzzle piece  which is water. Each of us  every day  need just eight glasses of this  because we're human. When we run out of water  as we are in some parts of the world and soon to be in other parts of the world  we're going to have to get this from the sea  and that's going to require us to build desalination plants.    trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend. These also require tremendous amounts of energy. In fact  it's going to require twice the world's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water. We're simply not going to do that. But in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply  we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need. I'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists  no kinder than many of the people in the world  but they have a magic look at the world. And I'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world. It's been a long time in coming for me.    years ago  I saw a photograph in the paper. It was taken by Kevin Carter who went to the Sudan to document their famine there. I've carried this photograph with me every day since then. It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst. By any standard this is wrong. It's just wrong. We can do better than this. We should do better than this. And whenever I go round to somebody who says   You know what  you're working on something that's too difficult. It'll never happen. You don't have enough money. You don't have enough time. There's something much more interesting around the corner   I say   Try saying that to her.  That's what I say in my mind. And I just say  thank you   and I go on to the next one. This is why we have to solve our problems  and I know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature  the stuff of life  the simple electron. Thank you. Good afternoon. If you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks  you may have heard of a kind of crisis between China and the U.S. regarding cyberattacks against the American company Google. Many things have been said about this. Some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation    and obviously  a quite mishandled one. However  this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the Western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons. It so happens that these weapons are dangerous. They're of a new nature  they could lead the world into a digital conflict that could turn into an armed struggle. These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world. In       in the middle of the Cold War in Soviet Siberia  a pipeline exploded with a burst of   kilotons  the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb. Now we know today    this was revealed by Thomas Reed  Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary    this explosion was actually the result of a CIA sabotage operation  in which they had managed to infiltrate the IT management systems of that pipeline. More recently  the U.S. government revealed that in September       more than   million people in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil were plunged into darkness  victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates. Even more worrying for the Americans  in December      the holiest of holies  the IT systems of CENTCOM  the central command managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  may have been infiltrated by hackers who used these  plain but infected USB keys. And with these keys  they may have been able to get inside CENTCOM's systems  to see and hear everything  and maybe even infect some of them. As a result  the Americans take the threat very seriously. I'll quote General James Cartwright  Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  who says in a report to Congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction. Moreover  the Americans have decided to spend over    billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities. And across the world today  we see a sort of cyber arms race  with cyberwar units built up by countries like North Korea or even Iran. Yet  what you'll never hear from spokespeople from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence is that the question isn't really who's the enemy  but actually the very nature of cyber weapons. And to understand why  we must look at how  through the ages  military technologies have maintained or destroyed world peace. For example  if we'd had TEDxParis     years ago  we would have talked about the military innovation of the day    the massive Vauban style fortifications    and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in Europe. which was indeed the case in Europe between      and     . Similarly  if we'd had this talk    or    years ago  we would have seen how the rise of nuclear weapons  and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply  prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers. However  if we'd had this talk    years ago  we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies  which give the advantage to the attacker  make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in Europe. So military technologies can influence the course of the world  can make or break world peace    and there lies the issue with cyber weapons. The first issue  Imagine a potential enemy announcing they're building a cyberwar unit  but only for their country's defense. Okay  but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit  It gets even more complicated when the doctrines of use become ambiguous. Just   years ago  both the U.S. and France were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace  strictly to defend their IT systems. But today both countries say the best defense is to attack. And so  they're joining China  whose doctrine of use for    years has been both defensive and offensive. The second issue  Your country could be under cyberattack with entire regions plunged into total darkness  and you may not even know who's attacking you. Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature  they can be used without leaving traces. This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker  because the defender doesn't know who to fight back against. And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary  they risk making one more enemy and ending up diplomatically isolated. This issue isn't just theoretical. In May       Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks  that damaged its communication and banking systems. Estonia accused Russia. But NATO  though it defends Estonia  reacted very prudently. Why  Because NATO couldn't be      sure that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks. So to sum up  on the one hand  when a possible enemy announces they're building a cyberwar unit  you don't know whether it's for attack or defense. On the other hand  we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking. In a major article published in       Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York described a model to understand how conflicts could arise. In this context  when you don't know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack  and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking  then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict. This is the environment that's being created by cyber weapons today  and historically it was the environment in Europe at the onset of World War I. So cyber weapons are dangerous by nature  but in addition  they're emerging in a much more unstable environment. If you remember the Cold War  it was a very hard game  but a stable one played only by two players  which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers. Today we're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated  as we have seen at Copenhagen. And this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons. Why  Because no nation knows for sure whether its neighbor is about to attack. So nations may live under the threat of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling called the  reciprocal fear of surprise attack   as I don't know if my neighbor is about to attack me or not    I may never know    so I might take the upper hand and attack first. Just last week  in a New York Times article dated January           it was revealed for the first time that officials at the National Security Agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the U.S. was about to be cyberattacked. And these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace. In May       General Kevin Chilton  commander of the U.S. nuclear forces  stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.  all options would be on the table. Cyber weapons do not replace conventional or nuclear weapons    they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror. But in doing so  they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict    as we've just seen  a very important risk    and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us  European allies  NATO members  our American friends and allies  our other Western allies  and maybe  by forcing their hand a little  our Russian and Chinese partners. The information technologies Jo l de Rosnay was talking about  which were historically born from military research  are today on the verge of developing an offensive capability of destruction  which could tomorrow  if we're not careful  completely destroy world peace. Thank you. So today  I would like to talk with you about bionics  which is the popular term for the science of replacing part of a living organism with a mechatronic device  or a robot. It is essentially the stuff of life meets machine. And specifically  I'd like to talk with you about how bionics is evolving for people with arm amputations. This is our motivation. Arm amputation causes a huge disability. I mean  the functional impairment is clear. Our hands are amazing instruments. And when you lose one  far less both  it's a lot harder to do the things we physically need to do. There's also a huge emotional impact. And actually  I spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability. And finally  there's a profound social impact. We talk with our hands. We greet with our hands. And we interact with the physical world with our hands. And when they're missing  it's a barrier. Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma  with things like industrial accidents  motor vehicle collisions or  very poignantly  war. There are also some children who are born without arms  called congenital limb deficiency. Unfortunately  we don't do great with upper limb prosthetics. There are two general types. They're called body powered prostheses  which were invented just after the Civil War  refined in World War I and World War II. Here you see a patent for an arm in     . It's not a lot different than the one you see on my patient. They work by harnessing shoulder power. So when you squish your shoulders  they pull on a bicycle cable. And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook or bend an elbow. And we still use them commonly  because they're very robust and relatively simple devices. The state of the art is what we call myoelectric prostheses. These are motorized devices that are controlled by little electrical signals from your muscle. Every time you contract a muscle  it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis. They work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand  because your hand muscles are still there. You squeeze your hand  these muscles contract. You open it  these muscles contract. So it's intuitive  and it works pretty well. Well how about with higher levels of amputation  Now you've lost your arm above the elbow. You're missing not only these muscles  but your hand and your elbow too. What do you do  Well our patients have to use very code y systems of using just their arm muscles to operate robotic limbs. We have robotic limbs. There are several available on the market  and here you see a few. They contain just a hand that will open and close  a wrist rotator and an elbow. There's no other functions. If they did  how would we tell them what to do  We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors  or six degrees of freedom. And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the U.S. military  using these prototypes  that had up to    different degrees of freedom including movable hands. But at the end of the day  how do we tell these robotic arms what to do  How do we control them  Well we need a neural interface  a way to connect to our nervous system or our thought processes so that it's intuitive  it's natural  like for you and I. Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain  going down your spinal cord  out the nerves and to your periphery. And your sensation's the exact opposite. You touch yourself  there's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain. When you lose your arm  that nervous system still works. Those nerves can put out command signals. And if I tap the nerve ending on a World War II vet  he'll still feel his missing hand. So you might say  let's go to the brain and put something in the brain to record signals  or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there. And these are very exciting research areas  but it's really  really hard. You have to put in hundreds of microscopic wires to record from little tiny individual neurons    ordinary fibers that put out tiny signals that are microvolts. And it's just too hard to use now and for my patients today. So we developed a different approach. We're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals    muscles. Muscles will amplify the nerve signals about a thousand fold  so that we can record them from on top of the skin  like you saw earlier. So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation. Imagine  with somebody who's lost their whole arm  we still have four major nerves that go down your arm. And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it. Now you think   Close hand   and a little section of your chest contracts. You think   Bend elbow   a different section contracts. And we can use electrodes or antennae to pick that up and tell the arm to move. That's the idea. So this is the first man that we tried it on. His name is Jesse Sullivan. He's just a saint of a man       year old lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder. Jesse came to us at the RIC to be fit with these state of the art devices  and here you see them. I'm still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side. And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches. On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis with those three joints  and he operates little pads in his shoulder that he touches to make the arm go. And Jesse's a good crane operator  and he did okay by our standards. He also required a revision surgery on his chest. And that gave us the opportunity to do targeted reinnervation. So my colleague  Dr. Greg Dumanian  did the surgery. First  we cut away the nerve to his own muscle  then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest and closed him up. And after about three months  the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch. And after six months  the nerves grew in well  and you could see strong contractions. And this is what it looks like. This is what happens when Jesse thinks open and close his hand  or bend or straighten your elbow. You can see the movements on his chest  and those little hash marks are where we put our antennae  or electrodes. And I challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this. His brain is thinking about his arm. He has not learned how to do this with the chest. There is not a learning process. That's why it's intuitive. So here's Jesse in our first little test with him. On the left hand side  you see his original prosthesis  and he's using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other. He's had that arm for about    months  so he's pretty good with it. On the right side  two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis    which  by the way  is the same physical arm  just programmed a little different    you can see that he's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks. And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time. Then we had one of those little surprises in science. So we're all motivated to get motor commands to drive robotic arms. And after a few months  you touch Jesse on his chest  and he felt his missing hand. His hand sensation grew into his chest again probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat  so the skin was right down to the muscle and deinnervated  if you would  his skin. So you touch Jesse here  he feels his thumb  you touch it here  he feels his pinky. He feels light touch down to one gram of force. He feels hot  cold  sharp  dull  all in his missing hand  or both his hand and his chest  but he can attend to either. So this is really exciting for us  because now we have a portal  a portal  or a way to potentially give back sensation  so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand. Imagine sensors in the hand coming up and pressing on this new hand skin. So it was very exciting. We've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above the elbow amputations. And here we deinnervate  or cut the nerve away  just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal. This was one of our first patients  Chris. You see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use  and on the right  it is two months. He's about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric. All right. So one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collaborators. And we're fortunate today to have Amanda Kitts come and join us. Please welcome Amanda Kitts. So Amanda  would you please tell us how you lost your arm  Amanda Kitts  Sure. In       I had a car accident. And I was driving home from work  and a truck was coming the opposite direction  came over into my lane  ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off. Todd Kuiken  Okay  so after your amputation  you healed up. And you've got one of these conventional arms. Can you tell us how it worked  AK  Well  it was a little difficult  because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep. So for the simple little things like picking something up  I would have to bend my elbow  and then I would have to cocontract to get it to change modes. When I did that  I had to use my bicep to get the hand to close  use my tricep to get it to open  cocontract again to get the elbow to work again. TK  So it was a little slow  AK  A little slow  and it was just hard to work. You had to concentrate a whole lot. TK  Okay  so I think about nine months later that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery  took six more months to have all the reinnervation. Then we fit her with a prosthesis. And how did that work for you  AK  It works good. I was able to use my elbow and my hand simultaneously. I could work them just by my thoughts. So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that. TK  A little faster  AK  A little faster. And much more easy  much more natural. TK  Okay  this was my goal. For    years  my goal was to let somebody  be  able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way and at the same time. And we now have over    patients around the world who have had this surgery  including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the U.S. armed services. The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high. It's like    percent. Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle. And it provides intuitive control. Our functional testing  those little tests  all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier. And the most important thing is our patients have appreciated it. So that was all very exciting. But we want to do better. There's a lot of information in those nerve signals  and we wanted to get more. You can move each finger. You can move your thumb  your wrist. Can we get more out of it  So we did some experiments where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks    from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm to reaching for something    and recorded this data. And then we used some algorithms that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms  called pattern recognition. See. And here you can see  on Jesse's chest  when he just tried to do three different things  you can see three different patterns. But I can't put in an electrode and say   Go there.  So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick  came up with this algorithm control  which Amanda can now demonstrate. AK  So I have the elbow that goes up and down. I have the wrist rotation that goes    and it can go all the way around. And I have the wrist flexion and extension. And I also have the hand closed and open. TK  Thank you  Amanda. Now this is a research arm  but it's made out of commercial components from here down and a few that I've borrowed from around the world. It's about seven pounds  which is probably about what my arm would weigh if I lost it right here. Obviously  that's heavy for Amanda. And in fact  it feels even heavier  because it's not glued on the same. She's carrying all the weight through harnesses. So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics  but the control. So we've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals. So Amanda  when you first started using this arm  how long did it take to use it  AK  It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train. I had to hook it up to a computer  so I couldn't just train it anywhere. So if it stopped working  I just had to take it off. So now it's able to train with just this little piece on the back. I can wear it around. If it stops working for some reason  I can retrain it. Takes about a minute. TK  So we're really excited  because now we're getting to a clinically practical device. And that's where our goal is    to have something clinically pragmatic to wear. We've also had Amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier. Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation. And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago. So Amanda  you can see  has really good control. It's all the pattern recognition. And it now has a hand that can do different grasps. What we do is have the patient go all the way open and think   What hand grasp pattern do I want   It goes into that mode  and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand. Amanda  how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm  AK  I was able to get four. I had the key grip  I had a chuck grip  I had a power grasp and I had a fine pinch. But my favorite one was just when the hand was open  because I work with kids  and so all the time you're clapping and singing  so I was able to do that again  which was really good. TK  That hand's not so good for clapping. AK  Can't clap with this one. TK  All right. So that's exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics  if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial. I want you to watch closely. TK  That's Claudia  and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic. She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces  and she could feel different textures of sandpaper  different grits  ribbon cable  as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin. She said that when she just ran it across the table  it felt like her finger was rocking. So that's an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back  potentially  some skin sensation. But here's another video that shows some of our challenges. This is Jesse  and he's squeezing a foam toy. And the harder he squeezes    you see a little black thing in the middle that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes. But look at all the electrodes around it. I've got a real estate problem. You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there  but our little motor's making all kinds of noise right next to my electrodes. So we're really challenged on what we're doing there. The future is bright. We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do. So for example  one is to get rid of my real estate problem and get better signals. We want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the EMG signals  so that it's not worrying about electrode contact. And we can have the real estate open to try more sensation feedback. We want to build a better arm. This arm    they're always made for the   th percentile male    which means they're too big for five eighths of the world. So rather than a super strong or super fast arm  we're making an arm that is    we're starting with  the   th percentile female    that will have a hand that wraps around  opens all the way  two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow. So it'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made. Once we can do it that small  it's a lot easier making them bigger. So those are just some of our goals. And we really appreciate you all being here today. I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side  with yesterday's theme. So Amanda came jet lagged  she's using the arm  and everything goes wrong. There was a computer spook  a broken wire  a converter that sparked. We took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm. And none of those problems could I have dealt with  but I have a really bright research team. And thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us and worked really hard yesterday to fix it. That's science. And fortunately  it worked today. So thank you very much. Is there anything unique about human beings  There is. We're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments. We're obsessed with morality as social creatures. We need to know why people are doing what they're doing. And I personally am obsessed with morality. It was all due to this woman  Sister Mary Marastela  also known as my mom. As an altar boy  I breathed in a lot of incense  and I learned to say phrases in Latin  but I also had time to think about whether my mother's top down morality applied to everybody. I saw that people who were religious and non religious were equally obsessed with morality. I thought  maybe there's some earthly basis for moral decisions. But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral. I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality. I want to know if there was a moral molecule. After    years of experiments  I found it. Would you like to see it  I brought some with me. This little syringe contains the moral molecule. It's called oxytocin. So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals. In rodents  it was known to make mothers care for their offspring  and in some creatures  allowed for toleration of burrowmates. But in humans  it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women  and is released by both sexes during sex. So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule. I did what most of us do    I tried it on some colleagues. One of them told me   Paul  that is the world's stupidist idea. It is   he said   only a female molecule. It can't be that important.  But I countered   Well men's brains make this too. There must be a reason why.  But he was right  it was a stupid idea. But it was testably stupid. In other words  I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral. Turns out it wasn't so easy. First of all  oxytocin is a shy molecule. Baseline levels are near zero  without some stimulus to cause its release. And when it's produced  it has a three minute half life  and degrades rapidly at room temperature. So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin  have to grab it fast and keep it cold. I think I can do that. Now luckily  oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood  so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery. Then I had to measure morality. So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project. So I started smaller. I studied one single virtue  trustworthiness. Why  I had shown in the early     s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous. So in these countries  more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created  alleviating poverty. So poor countries are by and large low trust countries. So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness  I might help alleviate poverty. But I'm also a skeptic. I don't want to just ask people   Are you trustworthy   So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research. If you're so virtuous  show me the money. So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money. Let me show you how we do that. So we recruit some people for an experiment. They all get     if they agree to show up. We give them lots of instruction  and we never ever deceive them. Then we match them in pairs by computer. And in that pair  one person gets a message saying   Do you want to give up some of your     you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab   The trick is you can't see them  you can't talk to them. You only do it one time. Now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person's account. You're going to make them a lot wealthier. And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money. Do you want to keep it all  or do you want to send some amount back  So think about this experiment for minute. You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half. Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood. And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger  So this was the birth of vampire economics. Make a decision and give me some blood. So in fact  experimental economists had run this test around the world  and for much higher stakes  and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust  and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness. But in fact  economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money. They assumed money is good  why not keep it all  That's not what we found. We found    percent of the first decision makers sent money  and of those who received money     percent returned some of it. But why  Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received  the more their brain produced oxytocin  and the more oxytocin on board  the more money they returned. So we have a biology of trustworthiness. But wait. What's wrong with this experiment  Two things. One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation. So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin  but they didn't have any effect. But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness. I didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness. So to make the experiment  I knew I'd have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly. I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain. And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler. So along with colleagues in Zurich  we put     men on oxytocin or placebo  had that same trust test with money  and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust  we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger    all without altering mood or cognition. So oxytocin is the trust molecule  but is it the moral molecule  Using the oxytocin inhaler  we ran more studies. We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by    percent. We showed it increases donations to charity by    percent. We've also investigated non pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin. These include massage  dancing and praying. Yes  my mom was happy about that last one. And whenever we raise oxytocin  people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers. But why do they do this  What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin  To investigate this question  we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year old son  and his son has terminal brain cancer. After they watched the video  we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin. The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy. So it's empathy that makes us connect to other people. It's empathy that makes us help other people. It's empathy that makes us moral. Now this idea is not new. A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in      called  The Theory of Moral Sentiments.  In this book  Smith argued that we are moral creatures  not because of a top down reason  but for a bottom up reason. He said we're social creatures  so we share the emotions of others. So if I do something that hurts you  I feel that pain. So I tend to avoid that. If I do something that makes you happy  I get to share your joy. So I tend to do those things. Now this is the same Adam Smith who     years later  would write a little book called  The Wealth of Nations     the founding document of economics. But he was  in fact  a moral philosopher  and he was right on why we're moral. I just found the molecule behind it. But knowing that molecule is valuable  because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off. In particular  it tells us why we see immorality. So to investigate immorality  let me bring you back now to     . I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara  California. You sit in a gas station all day  you see lots of morality and immorality  let me tell you. So one Sunday afternoon  a man walks into my cashier's booth with this beautiful jewelry box. Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside. And he said   Hey  I was in the men's room. I just found this. What do you think we should do with it    I don't know  put it in the lost and found.   Well this is very valuable. We have to find the owner for this.  I said   Yea.  So we're trying to decide what to do with this  and the phone rings. And a man says very excitedly   I was in your gas station a while ago  and I bought this jewelry for my wife  and I can't find it.  I said   Pearl necklace    Yeah.   Hey  a guy just found it.   Oh  you're saving my life. Here's my phone number. Tell that guy to wait half an hour. I'll be there and I'll give him a      reward.  Great  so I tell the guy   Look  relax. Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good.  He said   I can't do it. I have this job interview in Galena in    minutes  and I need this job  I've got to go.  Again he asked me   What do you think we should do   I'm in high school. I have no idea. So I said   I'll hold it for you.  He said   You know  you've been so nice  let's split the reward.  I'll give you the jewelry  you give me a hundred dollars  and when the guy comes ...   You see it. I was conned. So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop  and I was the pigeon. So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him  it's that he shows he trusts the victim. Now we know what happens. The victim's brain releases oxytocin  and you're opening up your wallet or purse  giving away the money. So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems  We found  testing thousands of individuals  that five percent of the population don't release oxytocin on stimulus. So if you trust them  their brains don't release oxytocin. If there's money on the table  they keep it all. So there's a technical word for these people in my lab. We call them bastards. These are not people you want to have a beer with. They have many of the attributes of psychopaths. Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited. One is through improper nurturing. So we've studied sexually abused women  and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus. You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly. Also  high stress inhibits oxytocin. So we all know this  when we're really stressed out  we're not acting our best. There's another way oxytocin is inhibited  which is interesting    through the action of testosterone. So we  in experiments  have administered testosterone to men. And instead of sharing money  they become selfish. But interestingly  high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish. Now think about this. It means  within our own biology  we have the yin and yang of morality. We have oxytocin that connects us to others  makes us feel what they feel. And we have testosterone. And men have    times the testosterone as women  so men do this more than women    we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally. We don't need God or government telling us what to do. It's all inside of us. So you may be wondering  these are beautiful laboratory experiments  do they really apply to real life  Yeah  I've been worrying about that too. So I've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives. So last summer  I attended a wedding in Southern England.     people in this beautiful Victorian mansion. I didn't know a single person. And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall. And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes. And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows. And guess what  Weddings cause a release of oxytocin  but they do so in a very particular way. Who is the center of the wedding solar system  The bride. She had the biggest increase in oxytocin. Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride  Her mother  that's right. Her mother was number two. Then the groom's father  then the groom  then the family  then the friends    arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun. So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple  connect us emotionally. Why  Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species. I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers. So even though I have a fear of heights  I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at        ft. I took my blood before and after  and I had a huge spike of oxytocin. And there are so many ways we can connect to people. For example  through social media. Many people are Tweeting right now. So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double digit increase in oxytocin. So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System. And they had the reporters and their producers participate. And one of these guys  he must have been     he had     percent spike in oxytocin. I mean  astounding  no one has this. So he was using social media in private. When I wrote my report to the Koreans  I said   Look  I don't know what this guy was doing   but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend. They checked. He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page. There you go. That's connection. So there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people  and it seems to be universal. Two weeks ago  I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands    very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia. There are     different languages in the highlands. These are the most primitive people in the world. And they indeed also release oxytocin. So oxytocin connects us to other people. Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel. And it's so easy to cause people's brains to release oxytocin. I know how to do it  and my favorite way to do it is  in fact  the easiest. Let me show it to you. Come here. Give me a hug. There you go. So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr. Love. I'm happy to share a little more love in the world  it's great  but here's your prescription from Dr. Love  eight hugs a day. We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier. And they're happier because they have better relationships of all types. Dr. Love says eight hugs a day. Eight hugs a day    you'll be happier and the world will be a better place. Of course  if you don't like to touch people  I can always shove this up your nose. Thank you. What is it about flying cars  We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years. And there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success. But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really  truly seamlessly integrates the two dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three dimensional sky above us    that  I don't know about you  but I really enjoy spending time in. We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that  despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren't available previously    we have modern composite materials  we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy and have better power to rate ratios than have ever been available  we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit    but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective  we realized that we were going to be getting the same result that people had been getting for the last hundred years  which isn't where we want to be right now. So instead of trying to make a car that can fly  we decided to try to make a plane that could drive. And the result is the Terrafugia Transition. It's a two seat  single engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane. You take off and land at a local airport. Then once you're on the ground  you fold up the wings  drive it home  park it in your garage. And it works. After two years of an innovative design and construction process  the proof of concept made its public debut in     . Now like with anything that's really different from the status quo  it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft. And we discovered that it's a very good thing that  when you go home with something that's been broken  you've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through. Still  we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we'd all helped build in the air  off the ground  like it was supposed to be. And on our third high speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York  we got to do that for the first time. The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time. And we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over. The flight testing that followed that was as basic and low risk as we could make it  but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market  the general aviation community  and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft  particularly in the States. The FAA  about a year ago  gave us an exemption for the Transition to allow us to have an additional     lbs. within the light sport aircraft category. Now that doesn't sound like a lot  but it's very important  because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it  but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it. A sport pilot can be certificated in as little as    hours of flight time. And at     lbs.  that's very important for solving the other side of the equation    driving. It turns out that driving  with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles  is actually a harder problem to solve than flying. For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground  this may be counter intuitive  but driving has potholes  cobblestones  pedestrians  other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with. Fortunately  necessity remains the mother of invention  and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground    everything from a continuously variable transmission and liquid based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop and go traffic  to a custom designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground  to the automated wing folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment  to crash safety features. We have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than    percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car. Now this also  as good as it is  wasn't quite enough. The regulations for vehicles on the road weren't written with an airplane in mind. So we did need a little bit of support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Now you may have seen in the news recently  they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the Transition to be sold in the same category as SUVs and light trucks. As a multi purpose passenger vehicle  it is now officially  designed for occasional off road use.  Now let's see it in action. You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane. You're not powering the propeller  you're powering the wheels. And it is under seven feet tall  so it will fit in a standard construction garage. And that's the automated wing folding mechanism. That's real time. You just push a few buttons in the cockpit  and the wings come out. Once they're fully deployed  there's a mechanical lock that goes into place  again  from inside the cockpit. And they're now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight    just like putting down your convertible top. And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.    percent of your risk is that first flight. Radio  It actually flew. Yes. Radio    That was gorgeous. Radio  What did you think of that  That was beautiful from up here  I tell you. AMD  See  we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop. And our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight  which was that it was  remarkably unremarkable.  He would go onto tell us that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he'd flown in his entire    year career as a test pilot. So despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary  we really focused on doing as little new as possible. We leverage a lot of technology from the state of the art in general aviation and from automotive racing. When we do have to do something truly out of the box  we use an incremental design  build  test  redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps. Now since we started Terrafugia about   years ago  we've had a lot of those baby steps. We've gone from being three of us working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school to about two dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of Boston. We've had to overcome challenges like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about  figuring out how to politely respond when a regulator tells you   But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended    to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues that we talked about on the ground. Still  if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the two production prototypes that we're working on right now  those first deliveries to the  about a hundred  people who have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year. The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes. And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy  but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane. Here's why. While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports  there is a huge underutilized resource out there. There are thousands of local airstrips that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could. On average  there's one within    to    miles of wherever you are in the United States. The Transition gives you a safer  more convenient and more fun way of using this resource. For those of you who aren't yet pilots  there's four main reasons why those of us who are don't fly as much as we'd like to  the weather  primarily  cost  long door to door travel time and mobility at your destination. Now  bad weather comes in  just land  fold up the wings  drive home. Doesn't matter if it rains a little  you have a windshield wiper. Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger  park it in your garage. And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas. Door to door travel time is reduced  because now  instead of lugging bags  finding a parking space  taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger  you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go. And mobility to your destination is clearly solved. Just fold up the wings and keep going. The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller  more accessible place. It also continues to be a fabulous adventure. I hope you'll each take a moment to think about how you could use something like this to give yourself more access to your own world  and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you. I'm a neuroscientist. And in neuroscience  we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain. But I want to start with the easiest question and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life  because it's a fundamental question if we want to understand brain function. And that is  why do we and other animals have brains  Not all species on our planet have brains  so if we want to know what the brain is for  let's think about why we evolved one. Now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think  and that's completely wrong. If you think about this question for any length of time  it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain. We have a brain for one reason and one reason only  and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements. There is no other reason to have a brain. Think about it. Movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you. Now that's not quite true. There's one other way  and that's through sweating. But apart from that  everything else goes through contractions of muscles. So think about communication    speech  gestures  writing  sign language    they're all mediated through contractions of your muscles. So it's really important to remember that sensory  memory and cognitive processes are all important  but they're only important to either drive or suppress future movements. There can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life. Now for those who don't believe this argument  we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain  but the clinching evidence is this animal here    the humble sea squirt. Rudimentary animal  has a nervous system  swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life. And at some point of its life  it implants on a rock. And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock  which it never leaves  is to digest its own brain and nervous system for food. So once you don't need to move  you don't need the luxury of that brain. And this animal is often taken as an analogy to what happens at universities when professors get tenure  but that's a different subject. So I am a movement chauvinist. I believe movement is the most important function of the brain    don't let anyone tell you that it's not true. Now if movement is so important  how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement  And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly  it's a very hard problem. But we can look at how well we're doing by thinking about how well we're doing building machines which can do what humans can do. Think about the game of chess. How well are we doing determining what piece to move where  If you pit Garry Kasparov here  when he's not in jail  against IBM's Deep Blue  well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win. And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room  it would win every time. That problem is solved. What about the problem of picking up a chess piece  dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board  If you put a five year old child's dexterity against the best robots of today  the answer is simple  the child wins easily. There's no competition at all. Now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard  One reason is a very smart five year old could tell you the algorithm for that top problem    look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win. So it's a very simple algorithm. Now of course there are other moves  but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution. When it comes to being dexterous  it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous. And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world  which has a lot of problems. But let me show you cutting edge robotics. Now a lot of robotics is very impressive  but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages. So this is the end of a Ph.D. project from one of the best robotics institutes. And the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass. It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about  but it can do it. But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human. Now if you want this robot to do a different task  that's another three year Ph.D. program. There is no generalization at all from one task to another in robotics. Now we can compare this to cutting edge human performance. So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox winning the world record for cup stacking. Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking. It's a high school sport where you have    cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order. And this is her getting the world record in real time. And she's pretty happy. We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that  and that's what we'd like to know. So in my group  what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement. And it sounds like an easy problem. You send a command down  it causes muscles to contract. Your arm or body moves  and you get sensory feedback from vision  from skin  from muscles and so on. The trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be. So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is  for example  sensory feedback is extremely noisy. Now by noise  I do not mean sound. We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal. So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard  crrcckkk  on the station you wanted to hear  that was the noise. But more generally  this noise is something that corrupts the signal. So for example  if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand  you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback. Similarly  when you put motor output on movement output  it's extremely noisy. Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts  just aim for the same spot over and over again. You have a huge spread due to movement variability. And more than that  the outside world  or task  is both ambiguous and variable. The teapot could be full  it could be empty. It changes over time. So we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise. Now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise. So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick  our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars. Now what I want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability. And to do that  I'm going to tell you about a framework which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last    years called Bayesian decision theory. And it's more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty. And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions. So let's think about the inference. You want to generate beliefs about the world. So what are beliefs  Beliefs could be  where are my arms in space  Am I looking at a cat or a fox  But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities. So we're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one    zero meaning I don't believe it at all  one means I'm absolutely certain. And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty. And the key idea to Bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference. You have data  and data in neuroscience is sensory input. So I have sensory input  which I can take in to make beliefs. But there's another source of information  and that's effectively prior knowledge. You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories. And the point about Bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs. And I've put the formula up there. I'm not going to explain what that formula is  but it's very beautiful. And it has real beauty and real explanatory power. And what it really says  and what you want to estimate  is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input. So let me give you an intuitive example. Imagine you're learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you. There are two sources of information Bayes' rule tells you. There's sensory evidence    you can use visual information auditory information  and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot. But you know that your senses are not perfect  and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red  representing numbers between  .  and maybe  . . That information is available in the current shot  but there's another source of information not available on the current shot  but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis  and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match. If you're playing against a very good opponent  they may distribute it in that green area  which is the prior distribution  making it hard for you to return. Now both these sources of information carry important information. And what Bayes' rule says is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow  which have the ellipses  and that's my belief. So it's the optimal way of combining information. Now I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago  we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills. And what it means is we really are Bayesian inference machines. As we go around  we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down  but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is  and then combine those in a real Bayesian way. Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula. And what this part really says is I have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs. So that really means I have to make predictions of the future. And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback it's going to get. And moreover  it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do. And to do that  I'll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input. So you send a command out  you get sensory feedback back  and that transformation is governed by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus. But you can imagine looking inside the brain. And here's inside the brain. You might have a little predictor  a neural simulator  of the physics of your body and your senses. So as you send a movement command down  you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions. So as I shake this ketchup bottle  I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row. And if I've got a good predictor  it predicts the same thing. Well why would I bother doing that  I'm going to get the same feedback anyway. Well there's good reasons. Imagine  as I shake the ketchup bottle  someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me. Now I get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act. So I get two sources. I get you tapping on it  and I get me shaking it  but from my senses' point of view  that is combined together into one source of information. Now there's good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events. Because external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant than feeling everything that's going on inside my body. So one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction    which is only based on your movement commands    with the reality. Any discrepancy should hopefully be external. So as I go around the world  I'm making predictions of what I should get  subtracting them off. Everything left over is external to me. What evidence is there for this  Well there's one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person. And so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling. It's been known for a long time  you can't tickle yourself as well as other people can. But it hasn't really been shown  it's because you have a neural simulator  simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense. So we can bring the experiments of the   st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem. And in effect  what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot  and they're going to move that back and forward. And then we're going to track that with a computer and use it to control another robot  which is going to tickle their palm with another stick. And then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things including ticklishness. I'll show you just one part of our study. And here I've taken away the robots  but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward. And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay. Either no time delay  in which case light would just tickle your palm  or with a time delay of two tenths of three tenths of a second. So the important point here is the right hand always does the same things    sinusoidal movement. The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle. All we're playing with is a tempo causality. And as we go from naught to  .  second  it becomes more ticklish. As you go from  .  to  .   it becomes more ticklish at the end. And by  .  of a second  it's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything. So whatever is responsible for this cancellation is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality. And based on this illustration  we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations. Now I have to admit  these are the worst studies my lab has ever run. Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes  you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant. So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena. And in the intervening years I had two daughters. And one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys  they get into fights    which started with one of them doing something to the other  the other retaliating. It quickly escalates. And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force. Now when I screamed at my children to stop  sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder. Now I happen to know my children don't lie  so I thought  as a neuroscientist  it was important how I could explain how they were telling inconsistent truths. And we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another  they generate the movement command. They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off. So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have    rather like the tickling. Whereas the passive recipient doesn't make the prediction  feels the full blow. So if they retaliate with the same force  the first person will think it's been escalated. So we decided to test this in the lab. Now we don't work with children  we don't work with hitting  but the concept is identical. We bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game. And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other. And the game is very simple. We started with a motor with a little lever  a little force transfuser. And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers for three seconds and then it stops. And that player's been told  remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser    and they do that. And player two's been told  remember the experience of that force. Use your other hand to apply the force back down. And so they take it in turns to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward. But critically  they're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms. So they don't know the rules the other person's playing by. And what we've measured is the force as a function of terms. And if we look at what we start with  a quarter of a Newton there  a number of turns  perfect would be that red line. And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this    a    percent escalation in force on each go. So it really suggests  when you're doing this    based on this study and others we've done    that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it's producing. So it re shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts. So we've made inferences  we've done predictions  now we have to generate actions. And what Bayes' rule says is  given my beliefs  the action should in some sense be optimal. But we've got a problem. Tasks are symbolic    I want to drink  I want to dance    but the movement system has to contract     muscles in a particular sequence. And there's a big gap between the task and the movement system. So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways. So think about just a point to point movement. I could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths. Having chosen a particular path  I can hold my hand on that path as infinitely many different joint configurations. And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed. So I have a huge amount of choice to make. Now it turns out  we are extremely stereotypical. We all move the same way pretty much. And so it turns out we're so stereotypical  our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping. So if I take some dots and set them in motion with biological motion  your brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on. Now this is a bunch of dots moving. You will know what this person is doing  whether happy  sad  old  young    a huge amount of information. If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit  you would have absolutely no idea what's going on. So why is it that we move the particular ways we do  Well let's think about what really happens. Maybe we don't all quite move the same way. Maybe there's variation in the population. And maybe those who move better than others have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation. So in evolutionary scales  movements get better. And perhaps in life  movements get better through learning. So what is it about a movement which is good or bad  Imagine I want to intercept this ball. Here are two possible paths to that ball. Well if I choose the left hand path  I can work out the forces required in one of my muscles as a function of time. But there's noise added to this. So what I actually get  based on this lovely  smooth  desired force  is a very noisy version. So if I pick the same command through many times  I will get a different noisy version each time  because noise changes each time. So what I can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if I choose that way. If I choose a different way of moving    on the right for example    then I'll have a different command  different noise  playing through a noisy system  very complicated. All we can be sure of is the variability will be different. If I move in this particular way  I end up with a smaller variability across many movements. So if I have to choose between those two  I would choose the right one because it's less variable. And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise. And one intuition to get is actually the amount of noise or variability I show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger. So you want to avoid big forces as one principle. So we've shown that using this  we can explain a huge amount of data    that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise. So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement. And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that. But it's also relevant for disease and rehabilitation. There are many diseases which effect movement. And hopefully if we understand how we control movement  we can apply that to robotic technology. And finally  I want to remind you  when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks  the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Quick question for you  Dan. So you're a movement     DW  Chauvinist.     chauvinist. Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about    the dreaming  the yearning  the falling in love and all these things    are a kind of side show  an accident  DW  No  no  actually I think they're all important to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end. So I think people who study sensation or memory without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood. The fact that we forget most of our childhood  for example  is probably fine  because it doesn't effect our movements later in life. You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement. CA  So you think that people thinking about the brain  and consciousness generally  could get real insight by saying  where does movement play in this game  DW  So people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake. You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision. And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way. CA  Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed. So historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non living systems on one side  and living systems on the other side. So we go from  say  this beautiful and complex crystal as non life  and this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side. Over the last hundred and fifty years or so  science has kind of blurred this distinction between non living and living systems  and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two. We'll just take one example here  a virus is a natural system  right  But it's very simple. It's very simplistic. It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements  it doesn't have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a parasite on other living systems in order to  say  reproduce and evolve. But what we're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non living end of this spectrum    so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory  mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures  and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems. Really what I'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life. So what are these characteristics that I'm talking about  These are them. We consider first that life has a body. Now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment. Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself. Life also has a kind of inheritable information. Now we  as humans  we store our information as DNA in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring. If we couple the first two    the body and the metabolism    we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate  and if we coupled these now to inheritable information  we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike  and would perhaps evolve. And so these are the things we will try to do in the lab  make some experiments that have one or more of these characteristics of life. So how do we do this  Well  we use a model system that we term a protocell. You might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell. It is a simple chemical model of a living cell  and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together  play together in a complex network to produce something that we call alive. In the laboratory what we want to do is much the same  but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules    so a drastic reduction in complexity  but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike. And so what we do is  we start simple and we work our way up to living systems. Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc  a hundred years ago  considering a kind of synthetic biology   The synthesis of life  should it ever occur  will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea.  That's his first statement. So if we actually create life in the laboratories  it's probably not going to impact our lives at all.  If we accept the theory of evolution  then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world  or between the non living and living world  forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life     so  the ones I just discussed     to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment.  So we start simple  we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life  and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike. This is how we can start to make a protocell. We use this idea called self assembly. What that means is  I can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab  and these chemicals will start to self associate to form larger and larger structures. So say on the order of tens of thousands  hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn't exist before. And in this particular example  what I took is some membrane molecules  mixed those together in the right environment  and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here. These membranes are also quite similar  morphologically and functionally  to the membranes in your body  and we can use these  as they say  to form the body of our protocell. Likewise  we can work with oil and water systems. As you know  when you put oil and water together  they don't mix  but through self assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form  and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell  as you will see later. So that's just forming some body stuff  right  Some architectures. What about the other aspects of living systems  So we came up with this protocell model here that I'm showing. We started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite. This is natural from the environment  this clay. It forms a surface that is  say  chemically active. It could run a metabolism on it. Certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay. For example  in this case  RNA  shown in red    this is a relative of DNA  it's an informational molecule    it can come along and it starts to associate with the surface of this clay. This structure  then  can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself  so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself  and that's shown in green here on this micrograph. So just through self assembly  mixing things together in the lab  we can come up with  say  a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body  right  So we're on a road towards living systems. But if you saw this protocell  you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive. It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms  it doesn't really do anything. So  something is missing. Some things are missing. So some things that are missing is  for example  if you had a flow of energy through a system  what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself  much like living systems do. So we came up with a different protocell model  and this is actually simpler than the previous one. In this protocell model  it's just an oil droplet  but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something  to actually become dynamic  as we'll see here. You add the droplet to the system. It's a pool of water  and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system. Okay  Oil droplet forms through self assembly  has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy  and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment. As we heard earlier  movement is very important in these kinds of living systems. It is moving around  exploring its environment  and remodeling its environment  as you see  by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell. So it's acting  in a sense  like a living system trying to preserve itself. We take this same moving protocell here  and we put it in another experiment  get it moving. Then I'm going to add some food to the system  and you'll see that in blue here  right  So I add some food source to the system. The protocell moves. It encounters the food. It reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there. Alright  So not only do we have this system that has a body  it has a metabolism  it can use energy  it moves around. It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself. Now  this doesn't have a brain  it doesn't have a neural system. This is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior. If we count the number of chemicals in that system  actually  including the water that's in the dish  we have five chemicals that can do this. So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do  and depending on the conditions  we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment. On the other hand we have two moving protocells that like to circle each other  and they form a kind of a dance  a complex dance with each other. Right  So not only do individual protocells have behavior  what we've interpreted as behavior in this system  but we also have basically population level behavior similar to what organisms have. So now that you're all experts on protocells  we're going to play a game with these protocells. We're going to make two different kinds. Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry inside that  when activated  the protocell starts to vibrate around  just dancing. So remember  these are primitive things  so dancing protocells  that's very interesting to us.  Laughter  The second protocell has a different chemistry inside  and when activated  the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one. Right  And we just put these two together in the same system. So there's population A  there's population B  and then we activate the system  and protocell Bs  they're the blue ones  they all come together. They fuse together to form one big blob  and the other protocell just dances around. And this just happens until all of the energy in the system is basically used up  and then  game over. So then I repeated this experiment a bunch of times  and one time something very interesting happened. So  I added these protocells together to the system  and protocell A and protocell B fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB. That didn't happen before. There it goes. There's a protocell AB now in this system. Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit  while protocell B does the fusing  okay  But then something even more interesting happens. Watch when these two large protocells  the hybrid ones  fuse together. Now we have a dancing protocell and a self replication event. Right.  Laughter  Just with blobs of chemicals  again. So the way this works is  you have a simple system of five chemicals here  a simple system here. When they hybridize  you then form something that's different than before  it's more complex than before  and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication. So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like  interesting colors and interesting behaviors  and they're very easy to make  and they have interesting lifelike properties  perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step  one of the first steps by which life got started on the early Earth. Certainly  there were molecules present on the early Earth  but they wouldn't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and I showed in these experiments. Rather  they'd be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff  because uncontrolled chemical reactions produce a diverse mixture of organic compounds. Think of it like a primordial ooze  okay  And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully characterize  even by modern methods  and the product looks brown  like this tar here on the left. A pure compound is shown on the right  for contrast. So this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen  you put them in a pan  and you apply energy. You turn up the heat  you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar  forming a brownish caramel  right  If you let that go unregulated  you'll continue to make and break chemical bonds  forming an even more diverse mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan  right  that's difficult to wash out. So that's what the origin of life would have looked like. You needed to get life out of this junk that is present on the early Earth  four   .  billion years ago. So the challenge then is  throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab  and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this kind of primordial ooze. So we're able to then see the self assembly of these oil droplet bodies again that we've seen previously  and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar    this diverse  very complex  organic black tar. And we put them into one of these experiments  as you've seen earlier  and then we watch lively movement that comes out. They look really good  very nice movement  and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other  similar to what we've seen before    but again  working with just primordial conditions  no pure chemicals. These are also  these tar fueled protocells  are also able to locate resources in their environment. I'm going to add some resource from the left  here  that defuses into the system  and you can see  they really like that. They become very energetic  and able to find the resource in the environment  similar to what we saw before. But again  these are done in these primordial conditions  really messy conditions  not sort of sterile laboratory conditions. These are very dirty little protocells  as a matter of fact.  Laughter  But they have lifelike properties  is the point. So  doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non living and living systems. And not only that  but it helps us broaden our view of what life is and what possible life there could be out there    life that could be very different from life that we find here on Earth. And that leads me to the next term  which is  weird life.  This is a term by Steve Benner. This is used in reference to a report in      by the National Research Council in the United States  wherein they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe  okay  especially if that life is very different from life on Earth. If we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there  how could we even recognize it as life  Well  they came up with three very general criteria. First is    and they're listed here. The first is  the system has to be in non equilibrium. That means the system cannot be dead  in a matter of fact. Basically what that means is  you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself. This is similar to having the Sun shining on the Earth  driving photosynthesis  driving the ecosystem. Without the Sun  there's likely to be no life on this planet. Secondly  life needs to be in liquid form  so that means even if we had some interesting structures  interesting molecules together but they were frozen solid  then this is not a good place for life. And thirdly  we need to be able to make and break chemical bonds. And again this is important because life transforms resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain itself. Now today  I told you about very strange and weird protocells    some that contain clay  some that have primordial ooze in them  some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them. Most of these don't contain DNA  but yet they have lifelike properties. But these protocells satisfy these general requirements of living systems. So by making these chemical  artificial life experiments  we hope not only to understand something fundamental about the origin of life and the existence of life on this planet  but also what possible life there could be out there in the universe. Thank you. Hi. Today  I'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects  done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors. We call ourselves Pors and Rao  and we live and work in India. I'd like to begin with my very first object  which I call  The Uncle Phone.  And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him  almost like I were an extension of his body    to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water  a pack of cigarettes. And as I grew up  it became worse and worse  And I started to think of it as a form of control. But of course  I could never say anything  because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family. And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone. He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him. And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle  I made him  The Uncle Phone.  It's so long that it requires two people to use it. It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person. But the problem is that  when I left home and went to college  I started missing his commands. And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email. So what he had to do was take a piece of paper  roll it into the carriage  type his email or command and pull the paper out. This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email. So here you can see  we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital. So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface. And of course  the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism  the way my uncle likes it. The next work is a sound sensitive installation that we affectionately call  The Pygmies.  And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy  sensitive and sweet creatures. So how it works is we have these panels  which we have on the wall  and behind them  we have these little creatures which hide. And as soon as it's silent  they sort of creep out. And if it's even more silent  they stretch their necks out. And at the slightest sound  they hide back again. So we had these panels on three walls of a room. And we had over     of these little pygmies hiding behind them. So this is how it works. This is a video prototype. So when it's quiet  it's sort of coming out from behind the panels. And they hear like humans do  or real creatures do. So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile. And they don't react to background sounds. You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to. But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second. So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible. So each pygmy has its own behavior  psyche  mood swings  personalities and so on. So this is a very early prototype. Of course  it got much better after that. And we made them react to people  but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them. This is a video installation called  The Missing Person.  And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility. How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility  So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance  and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us  using a camera that could look at people in the room  track them and replace one person with the background  rendering them invisible. So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype. On the right side you can see my colleague Soren  who's actually in the space. And on the left side  you'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible. Soren enters the room. Pop  He goes invisible. And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing. It's a very early video  so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that  but that got refined pretty soon  later. So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space  and we had one monitor  one on each wall. And as people walked into the room  they would see themselves in the monitor  except with one difference  one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room. So this is a work called  The Sun Shadow.  And it was almost like a sheet of paper  like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun. And from the front  this object appeared to be very strong and robust  and from the side  it almost seemed very weak. So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it  thinking it was some crap laying around. But as soon as they passed by  it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion. And it would get exhausted  and it would collapse every time. So this work is a caricature of an upside down man. His head is so heavy  full of heavy thoughts  that it's sort of fallen into his hat  and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant. Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement. And it's kind of constrained by that circle. Because if that circle weren't there  and the floor was very even  it would start to wander about in the space. And there's no wires. So I'll just show you an instance    so when people enter the room  it activates this object. And it very slowly  over a few minutes  sort of painfully goes up  and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall. And this is an important moment  because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help  or save the subject. But it doesn't really need it  because it  again  sort of manages to pull itself up. So this work was a real technical challenge for us  and we worked very hard  like most of our works  over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics. And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall  because if we made it in a way that it would topple over  then it would damage itself  and if it didn't fall enough  it wouldn't instill that fatalism  or that sense of wanting to go and help it. So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario    it's much faster. That's my colleague. He's let it go. Now he's getting nervous  so he's going to go catch it. But he doesn't need to  because it manages to lift itself up on its own. So this is a work that we were very intrigued with  working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics  which twinkle like the night sky. And it's at the scale of the night sky. So we wrapped this around a blob like form  which is in the shape of a teddy bear  which was hanging from the ceiling. And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear  which is very comforting and intimate. And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space  and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky. So this is the last work  and a work in progress  and it's called  Space Filler.  Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room  and as you approached it  it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and  eight  times its volume. And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it    almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something. So we work with a lot of technology  but we don't really love technology  because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years. But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create. And once a creature pops into our minds  it's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move. Thank you. I'd like to start with a short story. It's about a little boy whose father was a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their camp. They would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis  and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls  but at the same time they excited him. And the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work. Let's fast forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later  where I started a technology company that brought the world its first  D laser scanning system. Let me show you how it works. Female Voice  Long range laser scanning by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light. The system measures the beam's time of flight  recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return. With two mirrors  the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles  giving accurate x  y  and z coordinates. The point is then recorded into a  D visualization program. All of this happens in seconds. Ben Kacyra  You can see here  these systems are extremely fast. They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution. A surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard pressed to produce maybe     points in a whole day. These babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second. So  as you can imagine  this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry. Approximately ten years ago  my wife and I started a foundation to do good  and right about that time  the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas  hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan  were blown up by the Taliban. They were gone in an instant. And unfortunately  there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas. This clearly devastated me  and I couldn't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends  the winged bulls  and the fate of the many  many heritage sites all over the world. Both my wife and I were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites. We called the project CyArk  which stands for Cyber Archive. To date  with the help of a global network of partners  we've completed close to fifty projects. Let me show you some of them  Chichen Itza  Rapa Nui    and what you're seeing here are the cloud of points    Babylon  Rosslyn Chapel  Pompeii  and our latest project  Mt. Rushmore  which happened to be one of our most challenging projects. As you see here  we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal. The results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers. We also produce media for dissemination to the public    free through the CyArk website. These would be used for education  cultural tourism  etc. What you're looking at in here is a  D viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of  the  cloud of points in real time  cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions. This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal. In here you see a traditional  D architectural engineering drawing that's used for preservation  and of course we tell the stories through fly throughs. And here  this is a fly through the cloud of points of Tikal  and here you see it rendered and photo textured with the photography that we take of the site. And so this is not a video. This is actual  D points with two to three millimeter accuracy. And of course the data can be used to develop  D models that are very accurate and very detailed. And here you're looking at a model that's extracted from the cloud of points for Stirling Castle. It's used for studies  for visualization  as well as for education. And finally  we produce mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools. The more I got involved in the heritage field  the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them. Of course  earthquakes and all the natural phenomena    floods  tornadoes  etc.    take their toll. However  what occurred to me was human caused destruction  which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction  but actually it was accelerating. This includes arson  urban sprawl  acid rain  not to mention terrorism and wars. It was getting more and more apparent that we're fighting a losing battle. We're losing our sites and the stories  and basically we're losing a piece    and a significant piece    of our collective memory. Imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from. Luckily  in the last two or three decades  digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we've brought to bear in the digital preservation  in our digital preservation war. This includes  for example  the  D laser scanning systems  ever more powerful personal computers   D graphics  high definition digital photography  not to mention the Internet. Because of this accelerated pace of destruction  it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work. And we created a project we call the CyArk     Challenge    and that is to digitally preserve     World Heritage Sites in five years. We do have the technology that's scaleable  and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate  so we're comfortable that this task can be accomplished. However  to me  the     is really just the first    . In order to sustain our work into the future  we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them  whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites  and at the same time  it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future. Let me close with another short story. Two years ago  we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site  a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda  the Royal Kasubi Tombs. The work was done successfully in the field  and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the CyArk website. Last March  we received very sad news. The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson. A few days later  we received a call   Is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction   Our answer  of course  was yes. Let me leave you with a final thought. Our heritage is much more than our collective memory    it's our collective treasure. We owe it to our children  our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well  I'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so  while I've been speaking  you have been scanned. The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen. This is all in  D and of course you can fly through the cloud of points. You can look at it from on top  from the ceiling. You can look from different vantage points  but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd  just to show the amount of detail that we can create. So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes. I'd like to thank the wizards here. We were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this  the Historic Scotland  and the Glasgow School of Art. I'd like to also thank personally the efforts of David Mitchell  who is the Director of Conservation at Historic Scotland. David. And Doug Pritchard  who's the Head of Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art. Let's give them a hand. Thank you. Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain. We chart it  we've described it  we've drawn it  we've mapped it. Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology    think Google Maps  think GPS    the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation. So let's take a look at the brain. Most people  when they first look at a fresh human brain  they say   It doesn't look what you're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain.  Typically  what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray. And this outer layer  this is the vasculature  which is incredible  around a human brain. This is the blood vessels.    percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs     percent of the blood pumped from your heart  is servicing this one organ. That's basically  if you hold two fists together  it's just slightly larger than the two fists. Scientists  sort of at the end of the   th century  learned that they could track blood flow to map non invasively where activity was going on in the human brain. So for example  they can see in the back part of the brain  which is just turning around there. There's the cerebellum  that's keeping you upright right now. It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement. On the side here  this is temporal cortex. This is the area where primary auditory processing    so you're hearing my words  you're sending it up into higher language processing centers. Towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought  decision making    it's the last to mature in late adulthood. This is where all your decision making processes are going on. It's the place where you're deciding right now you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner. So if you take a deeper look at the brain  one of the things  if you look at it in cross section  what you can see is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there. But there's actually a lot of structure there. It's cells and it's wires all wired together. So about a hundred years ago  some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells. And that's shown here in the the very light blue. You can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained. And what you can see is it's very non uniform. You see a lot more structure there. So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex. It's one continuous processing unit  if you will. But you can also see things underneath there as well. And all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through. They're probably less cell dense. So there's about    billion neurons in our brain. And as you can see  they're very non uniformly distributed. And how they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function. And of course  as I mentioned before  since we can now start to map brain function  we can start to tie these into the individual cells. So let's take a deeper look. Let's look at neurons. So as I mentioned  there are    billion neurons. There are also these smaller cells as you'll see. These are support cells    astrocytes glia. And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input. They're storing it  they're processing it. Each neuron is connected via synapses to up to        other neurons in your brain. And each neuron itself is largely unique. The unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry. These are proteins. They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement. They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with. And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do. So if we zoom in to an even deeper level  all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes. We each have    pairs of chromosomes. We get one from mom  one from dad. And on these chromosomes are roughly        genes. They're encoded in the DNA. And the nature of a given cell driving its underlying biochemistry is dictated by which of these        genes are turned on and at what level they're turned on. And so our project is seeking to look at this readout  understanding which of these        genes is turned on. So in order to undertake such a project  we obviously need brains. So we sent our lab technician out. We were seeking normal human brains. What we actually start with is a medical examiner's office. This a place where the dead are brought in. We are seeking normal human brains. There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains. We want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of    to     they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain  no history of psychiatric disease  no drugs on board    we do a toxicology workup. And we're very careful about the brains that we do take. We're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue  we can get consent to take the tissue within    hours of time of death. Because what we're trying to measure  the RNA    which is the readout from our genes    is very labile  and so we have to move very quickly. One side note on the collection of brains  because of the way that we collect  and because we require consent  we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains. Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life. And men are much more likely to have their significant other  spouse  give consent than the other way around. So the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what's called an MR. This is magnetic resonance imaging    MRI. It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data. So we collect this MR. And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map. The next thing we do is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging. This maps the large cabling in the brain. And again  you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways  if you will. The brain is removed from the skull  and then it's sliced into one centimeter slices. And those are frozen solid  and they're shipped to Seattle. And in Seattle  we take these    this is a whole human hemisphere    and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer. There's a blade here that's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide. We're going to then apply one of those stains to it  and we scan it. And then what we get is our first mapping. So this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments. You could consider this state boundaries  if you will  those pretty broad outlines. From this  we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces  which then we can put on a smaller cryostat. And this is just showing this here    this frozen tissue  and it's being cut. This is    microns thin  so this is about a baby hair's width. And remember  it's frozen. And so you can see here  old fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied. We take a microscope slide. Then we very carefully melt onto the slide. This will then go onto a robot that's going to apply one of those stains to it. And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this. So again this is what they can see under the microscope. You can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places. And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments. And they can make basically what's a reference atlas. This is a more detailed map. Our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what's called laser scanning microdissection. So the technician takes the instructions. They scribe along a place there. And then the laser actually cuts. You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off. You can see on the microscope slide here  that's what's happening in real time. There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue. We take that tissue  we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology  and then we put a florescent tag on it. We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray. Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you  but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass. This has roughly        elements on it  so we repeatedly measure various genes of the        genes in the genome. And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it  we get a unique fingerprint  if you will  quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample. Now we do this over and over again  this process for any given brain. We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain. This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus. It's involved in learning and memory. And it contributes to about    samples of those thousand samples. So each sample gets us about        data points with repeat measurements  a thousand samples. So roughly  we have    million data points for a given human brain. We've done right now two human brains worth of data. We've put all of that together into one thing  and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like. It's basically a large data set of information that's all freely available to any scientist around the world. They don't even have to log in to come use this tool  mine this data  find interesting things out with this. So here's the modalities that we put together. You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before. Here's the MR. It provides the framework. There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn  it allows you to zoom in  it allows you to highlight individual structures. But most importantly  we're now mapping into this anatomic framework  which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on. So the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree. Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on. And each gene gives us a fingerprint. And remember that we've assayed all the        genes in the genome and have all of that data available. So what can scientists learn about this data  We're just starting to look at this data ourselves. There's some basic things that you would want to understand. Two great examples are drugs  Prozac and Wellbutrin. These are commonly prescribed antidepressants. Now remember  we're assaying genes. Genes send the instructions to make proteins. Proteins are targets for drugs. So drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off  etc. So if you want to understand the action of drugs  you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to  and also in the ways you don't want them to. In the side effect profile  etc.  you want to see where those genes are turned on. And for the first time  we can actually do that. We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too. So now we can look throughout the brain. We can see this unique fingerprint. And we get confirmation. We get confirmation that  indeed  the gene is turned on    for something like Prozac  in serotonergic structures  things that are already known be affected    but we also get to see the whole thing. We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before  and we see these genes turned on there. It's as interesting a side effect as it could be. One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can  because it's a pattern matching exercise  because there's unique fingerprint  we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint. So if you're in drug discovery  for example  you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize. Most of you are probably familiar with genome wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying   Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X.  And so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they're great. They analyze large populations. They look at their entire genomes  and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes. But what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes. It tells you the what  but it doesn't tell you the where. And so it's very important for those researchers that we've created this resource. Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity. They can start to look at common pathways    other things that they simply haven't been able to do before. So I think this audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality. And I think every human  we all have different genetic backgrounds  we all have lived separate lives. But the fact is our genomes are greater than    percent similar. We're similar at the genetic level. And what we're finding is actually  even at the brain biochemical level  we are quite similar. And so this shows it's not    percent  but it's roughly    percent correspondence at a reasonable cutoff  so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated. And then we find some outliers  some things that lie beyond the cloud. And those genes are interesting  but they're very subtle. So I think it's an important message to take home today that even though we celebrate all of our differences  we are quite similar even at the brain level. Now what do those differences look like  This is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were    and they're quite subtle. These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type. These are two genes that we found as good examples. One is called RELN    it's involved in early developmental cues. DISC  is a gene that's deleted in schizophrenia. These aren't schizophrenic individuals  but they do show some population variation. And so what you're looking at here in donor one and donor four  which are the exceptions to the other two  that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells. It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that's telling us a gene is turned on there. Whether or not that's due to an individual's genetic background or their experiences  we don't know. Those kinds of studies require much larger populations. So I'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go. I think these resources are incredibly valuable. They give researchers a handle on where to go. But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point. We're certainly going to be looking at more. I'll just close by saying that the tools are there  and this is truly an unexplored  undiscovered continent. This is the new frontier  if you will. And so for those who are undaunted  but humbled by the complexity of the brain  the future awaits. Thanks. I started Improv Everywhere about    years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy. Because I was new to the city  I didn't have access to a stage  so I decided to create my own in public places. So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride. Now this took place in January of     . And this woman is the star of the video. She doesn't know she's being filmed. She's being filmed with a hidden camera. This is on the   train in New York City. And this is the first stop along the line. These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera. And that's me right there in a brown coat. It's about    degrees outside. I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf. And the girl's going to notice me right here. And as you'll see now  I'm not wearing pants. So at this point    at this point she's noticed me  but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car. One person's not that unusual. She goes back to reading her book  which is unfortunately titled  Rape.  So she's noticed the unusual thing  but she's gone back to her normal life. Now in the meantime  I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well. They're going to be entering this car one by one. We'll act as though we don't know each other. And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made  forgetting our pants on this cold January day. So at this point  she decides to put the rape book away. And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings. Now in the meantime  the two Danish guys to the left of the camera  they're cracking up. They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before. And watch her make eye contact with them right about now. And I love that moment in this video  because before it became a shared experience  it was something that was maybe a little bit scary  or something that was at least confusing to her. And then once it became a shared experience  it was funny and something that she could laugh at. So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the   line. So the video won't show everything. This goes on for another four stops. A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear. At the eighth stop  a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar    like you might sell batteries or candy on the train. We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants  put them on and said   Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today   and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions. Thank you. So that's a still from the video there. And I love that girl's reaction so much. And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do. And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people. It's a prank  but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell. And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride. And we've continued to do it every year. This January  we did the   th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of       people rode the train in their underwear in New York    almost every single train line in the city. And also in    other cities around the world  people participated. As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians  I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects. So I could do more large scale projects. Well one day I was walking through Union Square  and I saw this building  which had just been built in     . And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing. And it was very peculiar  because it was dark out  but she was back lit with florescent lighting  and she was very much onstage  and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it. After about    seconds  her friend appeared    she had been hiding behind a display    and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away. So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this. So I got inspired by that. Looking at the entire facade    there were    total windows    and I knew what I had to do. So this project is called Look Up More. We had    actors dress in black. This was completely unauthorized. We didn't let the stores know we were coming. And I stood in the park giving signals. The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four foot tall letters that spelled out  Look Up More   the name of the project. The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together. You'll see that start right here. And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance. And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them. So then I gave a new hand signal  which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever     and he danced. There were several other activities. We had people jumping up and down  people dropping to the ground. And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt  putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement. And because it was in Union Square Park  right by a subway station  there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing. There's a better photo of it. So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon. The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger. A high school kid in Texas wrote me in      and said   You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around.  So I wrote this high school kid back immediately  and I said   Yes  you are correct. I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you.  So here's the video. So again  this is     . This is the Best Buy in New York City. We had about    people show up to participate  entering one by one. There was an eight year old girl  a    year old girl. There was also a    year old man who participated. So a very diverse group of people. And I told people   Don't work. Don't actually do work. But also  don't shop. Just stand around and don't face products.  Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt. Everybody else is one of our actors. The lower level employees thought it was very funny. And in fact  several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us. A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers. The managers and the security guards  on the other hand  did not find it particularly funny. You can see them in this footage. They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt. And we were there probably    minutes before the managers decided to dial    . So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming  watch out  the cops were coming. And you can see the cops in this footage right here. That's a cop wearing black right there  being filmed with a hidden camera. Ultimately  the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not  in fact  illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants. Thank you. So we had been there for    minutes  we were happy to exit the store. One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras. And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags. But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop. So I like that concept of using their own technology against them. I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason. And one morning  I was riding the subway. I had to make a transfer at the   rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators. And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning  it's very crowded. So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning. So this was in the winter of              in the morning. It's morning rush hour. It's very cold outside. People are coming in from Queens  transferring from the E train to the   train. And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs. Thank you. So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better. He gave       high fives that day  and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick. And that was done also without permission  although no one seemed to care. So I'd say over the years  one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is   These people have too much time on their hands.  And you know  not everybody's going to like everything you do  and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments  but that one's always bothered me  because we don't have too much time on our hands. The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers  they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way. You know  every Saturday and Sunday  hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games. And I've never seen anybody comment  looking at a football game  saying   All those people in the stands  they have too much time on their hands.  And of course they don't. It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon  watching a football game in a stadium. But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with     people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library. Or listening to the same MP  as       other people and dancing silently in a park  or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical  or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire. You know  as kids  we're taught to play. And we're never given a reason why we should play. It's just acceptable that play is a good thing. And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere. It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point. We don't need a reason. As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time  then that's enough for us. And I think  as adults  we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play. Thank you very much. I was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at Yale University in the department of medicine. And my job was to write many of the algorithms and code for NASA to do virtual surgery in preparation for the astronauts going into deep space flight  so they could be kept in robotic pods. One of the fascinating things about what we were working on is that we were seeing  using new scanning technologies  things that had never been seen before. Not only in disease management  but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you marvel. I remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen. And your entire body  everything    your hair  skin  bone  nails    everything is made of collagen. And it's a kind of rope like structure that twirls and swirls like this. And the only place that collagen changes its structure is in the cornea of your eye. In your eye  it becomes a grid formation  and therefore  it becomes transparent  as opposed to opaque. So perfectly organized a structure  it was hard not to attribute divinity to it. Because we kept on seeing this in different parts of the body. One of the opportunities I had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the NIH. And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these new technologies. So I wrote the algorithms and code  and he built the hardware    Paul Lauterbur    then went onto win the Nobel Prize for inventing the MRI. I got the data. And I'm going to show you a sample of the piece   From Conception to Birth.   From Conception to Birth   Oocyte   Sperm   Egg Inseminated      Hours  Baby's first division   The fertilized ovum divides a few hours after fusion...   And divides anew every    to    hours.   Early Embryo   Yolk sack still feeding baby.      Days  Heart chamber developing.      Days  Arms   hands are developing      Days  Beginning of the primitive vertebrae   These weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus.   If the fetus continues to grow at this speed for the entire   months  it would be  .  tons at birth.      Days   Embryo's heart is beating twice as fast as the mother's.      Days   Developing retina  nose and fingers   The fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth.      Weeks  Indifferent penis   Girl or boy yet to be determined     Months   Delivery  The expulsion stage   The moment of birth  Alexander Tsiaras  Thank you. But as you can see  when you actually start working on this data  it's pretty spectacular. And as we kept on scanning more and more  working on this project  looking at these two simple cells that have this unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you. And as we kept on working on this data  looking at small clusters of the body  these little pieces of tissue that were the trophoblasts coming off of the blastocyst  all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus  saying   I'm here to stay.  Having conversation and communications with the estrogens  the progesterones  saying   I'm here to stay  plant me   building this incredible trilinear fetus that becomes  within    days  something that you can recognize  and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being. The marvel of this information  How do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information  I'm going to show you something pretty unique. Here's a human heart at    days. It's just basically two strands. And like this magnificent origami  cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks  as it's just folding on itself. Within five weeks  you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles. Six weeks  these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart    and then basically the development of the entire human body. The magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure saying exactly where that nerve cell should go    the complexity of these  the mathematical models of how these things are indeed done are beyond human comprehension. Even though I am a mathematician  I look at this with marvel of how do these instruction sets not make these mistakes as they build what is us  It's a mystery  it's magic  it's divinity. Then you start to take a look at adult life. Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries. It's just a tiny sub substructure  microscopic. But basically by the time you're nine months and you're given birth  you have almost        miles of vessels inside your body. And only one mile is visible.        miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away. The complexity of building that within a single system is  again  beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today. And then instructions set  from the brain to every other part of the body    look at the complexity of the folding. Where does this intelligence of knowing that a fold can actually hold more information  so as you actually watch the baby's brain grow. And this is one of the things we're doing. We're launching two new studies of scanning babies' brains from the moment they're born. Every six months until they're six years old  we're going to be doing about     children  watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us. And it's not just our own existence  but how does the woman's body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own  but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological  cardiovascular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nurture  treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond  again  our comprehension    the magic that is existence  that is us  Thank you.  music by Moby   Grand Canyon  Narrator  Many of the tests are conducted while Yves is strapped onto the wing  because Yves' body is an integral part of the aircraft.  Wind tunnel tests  Narrator  The wing has no steering controls  no flaps  no rudder. Yves uses his body to steer the wing. Stefan Von Bergen  Well  he turns by just putting his head on one or the other side. And sometimes he assists that with his hands  sometimes even with the leg. He's acting as a human fuselage  so to say. And that's quite unique. Narrator  When he arches his back  he gains altitude. When he pushes his shoulders forward  he goes into a dive.  Swiss Alps   Strait of Gibraltar crossing   English Channel crossing  Commentator One  There he goes. There is Yves Rossy. And I think the wing is open. So our first critical moment  it's open. He is down. Is he flying  Commentator Two  It looks like he's stabilized. He's starting to make his climb. Commentator One  There's that    degree turn. He's out over the channel. There is Yves Rossy. There is no turning back now. He is over the English Channel and under way. Ladies and gentlemen  a historic flight has begun.  Images  National Geographic  Commentator Two  And as he approaches the ground  he's going to pull down on those toggles to flare  slow himself down just a little bit  and then come in for a nice landing. Commentator One  There he is. Yves Rossy has landed in England. Bruno Giussani  And now he's in Edinburgh. Yves Rossy  And his equipment as well. Yves  welcome. It is quite amazing. Those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities. And there were many  many others. So it's possible to fly almost like a bird. What is it like to be up there  Yves Rossy  It's fun. It's fun. I don't have feathers. But I feel like a bird sometimes. It's really an unreal feeling  because normally you have a big thing  a plane  around you. And when I strap just this little harness  this little wing  I really have the feeling of being a bird. BG  How did you start to become Jetman  YR  It was about    years ago  when I discovered free falling. When you go out of an airplane  you are almost naked. You take a position like that. And especially when you take a tracking position  you have the feeling that you are flying. And that's the nearest thing to the dream. You have no machine around you. You are just in the element. It's very short and only in one direction. So the idea was  okay  keep that feeling of freedom  but change the vector and increase the time. BG  So I'm kind of curious  what's your top speed  YR  It's about     km per hour before looping. That means about     miles per hour. BG  What's the weight of the equipment you're carrying  YR  When I exit full of kerosene  I'm about    kilos. I have    kilos on my back. BG  And you're not piloting  There is no handle  no steering  nothing  It is purely your body  and the wings become part of the body and vice versa  YR  That's really the goal  because if you put in steering  then you reinvent the airplane. And I wanted to keep this freedom of movement. And it's really like the kid playing the airplane. I want to go down like that. And up I climb  I turn. It's really pure flying. It's not steering  it's flight. BG  What kind of training do you do  you personally  for that  YR  Actually  I try to stay just fit. I don't do special physical training. I just try to keep my mobility through new activities. For example  last winter I began with kite surfing. So  new things. So you have to adapt. I'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot  but this is  really    You need fluidity  you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast. BG  Somebody in the audience asked me   How does he breathe up there   Because you're going fast and you're up at       meters or so. YR  Okay  up to       meters  it's not such a big problem with oxygen. But for example  bikers  they have the same speed. Just with the helmet  integral helmet  it's really no problem to breathe. BG  Describe for me the equipment  since you have it here. So Breitling's four engines. YR  Yeah  two meter span. Ultra stable profile. Four little engines     kilos thrust each  turbines  working with kerosene. Harness  parachute. My only instruments are an altimeter and time. I know I have about eight minutes fuel. So I just check before it's finished. And yeah  that's all. Two parachutes. That means  if I have a problem with the first one I pull  I still have the possibility to open the second one. And this is my life. That's the real important thing about safety. I did use that during these last    years about    times. Never with that type of wing  but at the beginning. I can release my wing when I am in a spin or unstable. BG  We saw the      crossing of the Gibraltar Strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean. So that was one of those cases where you let the wings go  right  YR  Yeah. I did try in the clouds  but you lose orientation completely. So I did try to take  again  a climb altitude. I thought  okay  I will go out. But most probably  I did something like that. BG  Something that is not very safe  the image. YR  You feel great  but    But you have not the right altitude. So the next thing I saw was just blue. It was the sea. I have also an audible altimeter. So I was at my minimum altitude in that vector    fast    so I pulled that. And then I did open my chute. BG  So the wings have their own parachute  and you have your two parachutes. YR  Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons  so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that  just on his head. BG  I see. Maybe come back here. This is risky stuff indeed. People have died trying to do this kind of thing. And you don't look like a crazy guy  you're a Swiss airline pilot  so you're rather a checklist kind of guy. I assume you have standards. YR  Yeah. I have no checklist for that. BG  Let's not tell your employer. YR  No  that's really two worlds. Civil aviation is something that we know very well. We have a hundred years of experience. And you can adapt really precisely. With that  I have to adapt to something new. That means improvise. So it's really a play between these two approaches. Something that I know very well  these principles. For example  we have two engines on an Airbus  with only one engine  you can fly it. So plan B  always a plan B. In a fighter  you have an ejection seat. That's my ejection seat. So I have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect of a pioneer in front of Mother Nature. BG  It's well said. What happens if one of the engines stops  YR  I do a roll. And then I stabilize  and according to my altitude  I continue on two or three engines. It's sometimes possible. It's quite complicated to explain  but according to which regime I was  I can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land  and then I open my parachute. BG  So the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter  and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines  and then you basically take off mid air somewhere. And then the landing  as we have seen  arriving on this side of the Channel  is through a parachute. So just as a curiosity  where did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon  Did you land on the rim  down at the bottom  YR  It was down on the bottom. And I came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back. But it was too stony and full of cactus on top. BG  That's exactly why I asked the question. YR  And also  the currents are quite funny there. There is big thermal activity  big difference in altitude also. So it was much safer for me to land at the bottom. BG  I think that right now  many people are asking   When are you developing a double seater so they can fly with you   YR  I have a standard answer. Have you ever seen tandem birds  BG  Perfect answer. BG  Yves  one last question. What's next for you  What's next for Jetman  YR  First  to instruct a younger guy. I want to share it  to do formation flights. And I plan to start from a cliff  like catapulted from a cliff. BG  So instead of jumping off a plane  yes  YR  Yes  with the final goal to take off  but with initial speed. Really  I go step by step. It seems a little bit crazy  but it's not. It's possible to start already now  it's just too dangerous. Thanks to the increasing technology  better technology  it will be safe. And I hope it will be for everybody. BG  Yves  thank you very much. Yves Rossy. I've always had a fascination for computers and technology  and I made a few apps for the iPhone  iPod Touch  and iPad. I'd like to share a couple with you today. My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was. My favorite and most successful app is Bustin Jieber  which is      Laughter      which is a Justin Bieber Whac A Mole. I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit  so I decided to make the app. So I went to work programming it  and I released it just before the holidays in     . A lot of people ask me  how did I make these  A lot of times it's because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also. A lot of kids these days like to play games  but now they want to make them  and it's difficult  because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program. I mean  for soccer  you could go to a soccer team. For violin  you could get lessons for a violin. But what if you want to make an app  And their parents  the kid's parents might have done some of these things when they were young  but not many parents have written apps.  Laughter  Where do you go to find out how to make an app  Well  this is how I approached it. This is what I did. First of all  I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down  such as Python  C  Java  etc. And then Apple released the iPhone  and with it  the iPhone software development kit  and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app. This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me  and after playing with the software development kit a little bit  I made a couple apps  I made some test apps. One of them happened to be Earth Fortune  and I was ready to put Earth Fortune on the App Store  and so I persuaded my parents to pay the    dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the App Store. They agreed  and now I have apps on the App Store. I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family  friends  teachers and even people at the Apple Store  and that's been a huge help to me. I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs  and I've started an app club at school  and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club. Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app. This is so I can share my experiences with others. There's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program  and some districts have them. I'm fortunate enough to be part of one. A big challenge is  how should the iPads be used  and what apps should we put on the iPads  So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like. When we design the app and we sell it  it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to  all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations. These days  students usually know a little bit more than teachers with the technology.  Laughter  So     Laughter     sorry     Laughter     so this is a resource to teachers  and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it. I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future. First of all  I'd like to create more apps  more games. I'm working with a third party company to make an app. I'd like to get into Android programming and development  and I'd like to continue my app club  and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others. Thank you.  Applause  Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging  This is a dream of the ages. But scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible. They thought you just wear out  there's nothing you can do about it    kind of like an old shoe. But if you look in nature  you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans. Now these animals are different from one another  because they have different genes. So that suggests that somewhere in these genes  somewhere in the DNA  are genes for aging  genes that allow them to have different lifespans. So if there are genes like that  then you can imagine that  if you could change one of the genes in an experiment  an aging gene  maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan. And if you could do that  then you could find the genes for aging. And if they exist and you can find them  then maybe one could eventually do something about it. So we've set out to look for genes that control aging. And we didn't study any of these animals. Instead  we studied a little  tiny  round worm called C. elegans  which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence. And we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long lived mutant. So we started to change genes at random  looking for long lived animals. And we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf   doubled the lifespan of the little worm. So you can see in black  after a month    they're very short lived  that's why we like to study them for studies of aging    in black  after a month  the normal worms are all dead. But at that time  most of the mutant worms are still alive. And it isn't until twice as long that they're all dead. And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here. So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age    a young adult. It's quite a cute little fellow. And next you're going to see the long lived mutant when it's young. So this animal is going to live twice as long. Is it miserable  It doesn't seem to be. It's active. You can't tell the difference really. And they can be completely fertile    have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do. Now get out your handkerchiefs here. You're going to see  in just two weeks  the normal worms are old. You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there. But everything else is just lying there. The animal's clearly in the nursing home. And if you look at the tissues of the animal  they're starting to deteriorate. You know  even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans    which probably most of you haven't seen one    you can tell they're old    isn't that interesting  So there's something about aging that's kind of universal. And now here is the daf   mutant. One gene is changed out of         and look at it. It's the same age  but it's not in the nursing home  it's going skiing. This is what's really cool  it's aging more slowly. It takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day. And when I tell people about this  they tend to think of maybe an    or    year old person who looks really good for being    or   . But it's really more like this  let's say you're a    year old guy    or in your   s    and you're a bachelor and you're dating people. And you meet someone you really like  you get to know her. And you're in a restaurant  and you say   Well how old are you   She says   I'm   .  That's what it's like. And you would never know. You would never know  until she told you. Okay. So what is the daf   gene  Well as you know  genes  which are part of the DNA  they're instructions to make a protein that does something. And the daf   gene encodes a hormone receptor. So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell. So part of it is like a baseball glove. Part of it's on the outside  and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green. And the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell. Okay  so what is the daf   receptor telling the inside of the cell  I just told you that  if you make a mutation in the daf   gene cell  that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well  the animal lives longer. So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging. That's what that arrow means. It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster. So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself  speeding up aging. So this is altogether really  really interesting. It says that aging is subject to control by the genes  and specifically by hormones. So what kind of hormones are these  There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone  adrenalin. You know about a lot of them. These hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies. The daf   hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF  . Now you've all heard of at least insulin. Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal. And the hormone IGF   promotes growth. So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time  but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about    maybe they also affect aging. And it's looking like that's the case. So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans  people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking  if we made the same daf   mutation  the hormone receptor mutation  in other animals  will they live longer  And that is the case in flies. If you change this hormone pathway in flies  they live longer. And also in mice    and mice are mammals like us. So it's an ancient pathway  because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals. And also  the common precursor also gave rise to people. So maybe it's working in people the same way. And there are hints of this. So for example  there was one study that was done in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City. And just like any population  most of the people live to be about    or     but some live to be    or    . And what they found was that people who lived to    or     were more likely to have daf   mutations    that is  changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF  . And these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted. It damaged the gene. So those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging. So the next question  of course  is  Is there any effect on age related disease  As you age  you're much more likely to get cancer  Alzheimer's disease  heart disease  all sorts of diseases. It turns out that these long lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases. They hardly get cancer  and when they do it's not as severe. So it's really interesting  and it makes sense in a way  that they're still young  so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old  So it suggests that  if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans  maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age related diseases all at once. So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging  How could that work  Well it turns out that in the daf   mutants  a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues  and repair damage. And the way that they're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO. So in a daf   mutant    you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor. The receptor isn't working as well. Under those conditions  the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus    that little compartment there in the middle of the cell    and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it. You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO. And it's just sitting on one of them. So FOXO turns on a lot of genes. And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes  genes I call carrot giver genes  whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well    to fold correctly and function correctly. And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they're damaged. DNA repair genes are more active in these animals. And the immune system is more active. And many of these different genes  we've shown  actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf   mutant. So it's really interesting. These animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do. They have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage  which we think makes them live longer. So what about the normal worm  Well when the daf   receptor is active  then it triggers a series of events that prevent FOXO from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is. So it can't turn the genes on. That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan  until we have the daf   mutant. But what good is this for the worm  Well we think that insulin and IGF   hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions    in the good times    when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment. Then they promote the uptake of nutrients. You can store the food  use it for energy  grow  etc. But what we think is that  under conditions of stress  the levels of these hormones drop    for example  having limited food supply. And that  we think  is registered by the animal as a danger signal  a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity. So it activates FOXO  FOXO goes to the DNA  and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself. And that's why we think the animals live longer. So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent. So maybe he's a little bit lazy  but he's there  he's taking care of the building. But it's deteriorating. And then suddenly  he learns that there's going to be a hurricane. So he doesn't actually do anything himself. He gets on the telephone    just like FOXO gets on the DNA    and he calls up the roofer  the window person  the painter  the floor person. And they all come and they fortify the house. And then the hurricane comes through  and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in. And not only that  it can also just last longer  even if there isn't a hurricane. So that's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists. Now the really cool thing about FOXO is that there are different forms of it. We all have FOXO genes  but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene. Just like we all have eyes  but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes. And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be    or    . And that's the case all over the world  as you can see from these stars. And each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked   Okay  are there differences in the type of FOXO genes among people who live a really long time   and there are. We don't know the details of how this works  but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people. And that means that  maybe if we tweak it a little bit  we can increase the health and longevity of people. So this is really exciting to me. A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little  round worms to affect lifespan  and here it affects lifespan in people. So we've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this FOXO cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age related diseases. And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work. There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging. And for at least one of them  there is a drug. There's one called TOR  which is another nutrient sensor  like the insulin pathway. And mutations that damage the TOR gene    just like the daf   mutations    extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice. But in this case  there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity. And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse    even when it's pretty old  like age    for a human  that old for a mouse    if you give the mouse rapamycin  it will live longer. Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin. It is a drug for people  but the reason is it suppresses the immune system. So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected. So this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer. But still  here in the year       there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan  which comes out of this science that's been done in all these different animals. So I'm really optimistic  and I think it won't be too long  I hope  before this age old dream begins to come true. Thank you. Matt Ridley  Thank you  Cynthia. Let me get this straight. Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me  what you could do now pretty well in the lab  if you were allowed ethically  is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer  CK  Ah  so the kinds of drugs I was talking about would not change the genes  they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity. So if you stop taking the drug  the protein would go back to normal. You could change the genes in principle. There isn't the technology to do that. But I don't think that's a good idea. And the reason is that these hormones  like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway  they're essential. If you knock them out completely  then you're very sick. So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems. And I think that's much better  that kind of control would be much better as a drug. And also  there are other ways of activating FOXO that don't even involve insulin or IGF   that might even be safer. MR  I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it  but ... There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about  which is a negligible senescence. There are some creatures on this planet already that don't really do aging. Just move to one side for us  if you would. CK  There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age. For example  there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles. And they grow to be about this size. And they've been tagged  and they've been found to be    years old. And when you look at these    year old turtles  you can't tell the difference  just by looking  between those turtles and    year old turtles. And the    year old ones  actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places  and they also have more progeny every year. And there are other examples of these kinds of animals  like turns  certain kinds of birds are like this. And nobody knows if they really can live forever  or what keeps them from aging. It's not clear. If you look at birds  which live a long time  cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide  things like that. And our long lived mutants are too. They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses. So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about  which are set to run really quickly in the worm  have a different normal set point in something like a bird  so that a bird can live a lot longer. And maybe they're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all    but we don't know. MR  But what you're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death  so much as extending human youthspan. CK  Yes  that's right. It's more like  say  if you were a dog. You notice that you're getting old  and you look at your human and you think   Why isn't this human getting old   They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan. It's more like that. But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human. MR  Thank you very much indeed  Cynthia Kenyon. I'd like to apologize  first of all  to all of you because I have no form of PowerPoint presentation. So what I'm going to do is  every now and again  I will make this gesture  and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy  you can imagine what you'd like to see. I do a radio show. The radio show is called  The Infinite Monkey Cage.  It's about science  it's about rationalism. So therefore  we get a lot of complaints every single week    complaints including one we get very often  which is to say the very title   Infinite Monkey Cage   celebrates the idea of vivisection. We have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy. We also had someone else who said   'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous. An infinite number of monkeys could never write the works of Shakespeare. We know this because they did an experiment.  Yes  they gave    monkeys a typewriter for a week  and after a week  they only used it as a bathroom. So the main element though  the main complaint we get    and one that I find most worrying    is that people say   Oh  why do you insist on ruining the magic  You bring in science  and it ruins the magic.  Now I'm an arts graduate  I love myth and magic and existentialism and self loathing. That's what I do. But I also don't understand how it does ruin the magic. All of the magic  I think  that may well be taken away by science is then replaced by something as wonderful. Astrology  for instance  like many rationalists  I'm a Pisces. Now astrology    we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted  that you'll  perhaps today  meet a lucky man who's wearing a hat. That is gone. But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions  we still can. We can see predictions of galaxies forming  of galaxies colliding into each other  of new solar systems. This is a wonderful thing. If the Sun could one day    and indeed the Earth  in fact    if the Earth could read its own astrological  astronomical chart  one day it would say   Not a good day for making plans. You'll been engulfed by a red giant.  And that to me as well  that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds  well Many Worlds theory    one of the most beautiful  fascinating  sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation    is a wonderful thing. That every person here  every decision that you've made today  every decision you've made in your life  you've not really made that decision  but in fact  every single permutation of those decisions is made  each one going off into a new universe. That is a wonderful idea. If you ever think that your life is rubbish  always remember there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that. If you ever think   Ah  I want to end it all   don't end it all. Remember that in the majority of universes  you don't even exist in the first place. This to me  in its own strange way  is very  very comforting. Now reincarnation  that's another thing gone    the afterlife. But it's not gone. Science actually says we will live forever. Well  there is one proviso. We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever. Your consciousness  the you ness of you  the me ness of me    that gets this one go. But every single thing that makes us  every atom in us  has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things. We have been mountains and apples and pulsars and other people's knees. Who knows  maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee. That is a good thing. Unlike the occupants of the universe  the universe itself is not wasteful. We are all totally recyclable. And when we die  we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs. This is a wonderful thing. Understanding  to me  does not remove the wonder and the joy. For instance  my wife could turn to me and she may say   Why do you love me   And I can with all honesty look her in the eye and say   Because our pheromones matched our olfactory receptors.  Though I'll probably also say something about her hair and personality as well. And that is a wonderful thing there. Love does not die because of that thing. Pain doesn't go away either. This is a terrible thing  even though I understand pain. If someone punches me    and because of my personality  this is recently a regular occurrence    I understand where the pain comes from. It is basically momentum to energy where the four vector is constant    that's what it is. But at no point can I react and go   Ha  Is that the best momentum to energy fourth vector constant you've got   No  I just spit out a tooth. And that is all of these different things    the love for my child. I have a son. His name is Archie. I'm very lucky  because he's better than all the other children. Now I know you don't think that. You may well have your own children and think   Oh no  my child's best.  That's the wonderful thing about evolution    the predilection to believe that our child is best. Now in many ways  that's just a survival thing. The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes  and therefore we love it. But we don't notice that bit  we just unconditionally love. That is a wonderful thing. Though I should say that my son is best and is better than your children. I've done some tests. And all of these things to me give such joy and excitement and wonder. Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework  for instance. Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own. You house is in a terrible state. Your partner is about to return. You think  what should I do  Do nothing. All you have to do is  when she walks in  using a quantum interpretation  say   I'm so sorry. I stopped observing the house for a moment  and when I started observing again  everything had happened.  That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming. For me  it's a very  very important thing. Even on my journey up here    the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time. If you actually think  you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful. I'm sitting on a train. Every time I breathe in  I'm breathing in a million billion billion atoms of oxygen. I'm sitting on a chair. Even though I know the chair is made of atoms and therefore actually in many ways empty space  I find it comfortable. I look out the window  and I realize that every single time we stop and I look out that window  framed in that window  wherever we are  I am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet Earth. If you go to the safari parks on Saturn or Jupiter  you will be disappointed. And I realize I'm observing this with the brain  the human brain  the most complex thing in the known universe. That  to me  is an incredible thing. And do you know what  that might be enough. Steven Weinberg  the Nobel laureate  once said   The more the universe seems comprehensible  the more it seems pointless.  Now for some people  that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism. But for me  it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing. I'm glad the universe is pointless. It means if I get to the end of my life  the universe can't turn to me and go   What have you been doing  you idiot  That's not the point.  I can make my own purpose. You can make your own purpose. We have the individual power to go   This is what I want to do.  And in a pointless universe  that  to me  is a wonderful thing. I have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation. You  I imagine  can do much better things with your time. Thank you very much. Goodbye. I want to talk to you about something kind of big. We'll start here.    million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day. A chunk of rock six miles across  moving something like    times the speed of a rifle bullet  slammed into the Earth. It released its energy all at once  and it was an explosion that was mind numbing. If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War  lumped them together and blew them up at the same time  that would be one one millionth of the energy released at that moment. The dinosaurs had a really bad day. Okay  Now  a six mile wide rock is very large. We all live here in Boulder. If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak  you're probably familiar with it. Now  scoop up Long's Peak  and put it out in space. Take Meeker  Mt. Meeker. Lump that in there  and put that in space as well  and Mt. Everest  and K   and the Indian peaks. Then you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about  okay  We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left. It hit in what we now know as Yucatan  the Gulf of Mexico. You can see here  there's the Yucatan Peninsula  if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there. Here is how big of a crater was left. It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale  okay  there you go. The scale here is    miles on top  a hundred kilometers on the bottom. This thing was     kilometers across        miles    an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet  threw up enough dust to block out the sun. It wiped out    percent of all species on Earth. Now  not all asteroids are that big. Some of them are smaller. Here is one that came in over the United States in October of     . It came in on a Friday night. Why is that important  Because back then  video cameras were just starting to become popular  and people would bring them  parents would bring them  to their kids' football games to film their kids play football. And since this came in on a Friday  they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina  Maryland  Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York. Now  this is not a     mile wide crater  but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here  about the size of a football  that hit that car and did that damage. Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in. It broke up through atmospheric pressure  it crumbled  and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage. Now  you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head  because it would do that to it. That would be bad. But it won't wipe out  you know  all life on Earth  so that's fine. But it turns out  you don't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage. There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock  and in fact  if any of you have ever been to near Winslow  Arizona  there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater. To give you a sense of scale  this is about a mile wide. If you look up at the top  that's a parking lot  and those are recreational vehicles right there. So it's about a mile across      feet deep. The object that formed this was probably about    to    yards across  so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here. It came in at speeds that were tremendous  slammed into the ground  blew up  and exploded with the energy of roughly a    megaton nuclear bomb    a very hefty bomb. This was        years ago  so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope  or something like that out in the desert  but it probably would not have caused global devastation. It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage. Now  in       over Siberia  near the Tunguska region    for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw  Ghostbusters   when he talked about the greatest cross dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of       where he got the date wrong  but that's okay.  Laughter  It was     . That's fine. I can live with that. Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground  several miles up above the surface of the Earth. The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it  and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles  okay  This did a huge amount of damage. And again  this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in. In Meteor Crater it was made of metal  and metal is much tougher  so it made it to the ground. The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock  and that's much more crumbly  so it blew up in the air. Either way  these are tremendous explosions     megatons. Now  when these things blow up  they're not going to do global ecological damage. They're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did. They're just not big enough. But they will do global economic damage  because they don't have to hit  necessarily  to do this kind of damage. They don't have to do global devastation. If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere  it would cause a panic. But if it came over a city  an important city    not that any city is more important than others  but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis    that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization. So  now that I've scared the crap out of you ... what can we do about this  All right  This is a potential threat. Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer for    million years. They're very rare. The smaller ones happen more often  but probably on the order of a millennium  every few centuries or every few thousand years  but it's still something to be aware of. Well  what do we do about them  The first thing we have to do is find them. This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in     . It's right here. But you can see that it's extremely faint. I don't even know if you can see that in the back row. These are just stars. This is a rock that was about    yards across  so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona        years ago. These things are faint. They're hard to see  and the sky is really big. We have to find these things first. Well the good news is  we're looking for them. NASA has devoted money to this. The National Science Foundation  other countries are very interested in doing this. We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat. That's a great first step  but what's the second step  The second step is that we see one heading toward us  we have to stop it. What do we do  You've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis. If you haven't yet  you will. If you've heard about the Mayan      apocalypse  you're going to hear about Apophis  because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway. Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in     . It's roughly     yards across  so it's pretty big    big size  you know  bigger than a football stadium    and it's going to pass by the Earth in April of     . And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites. The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it's just right  if it passes through this region of space  this kidney bean shaped region called the keyhole  the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April     which is a Friday  I'll note  in the year      ...  Laughter     you can't plan that kind of stuff    Apophis is going to hit us. And it's     meters across  so it would do unbelievable damage. Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go around are one in a million  roughly    very  very low odds  so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all. I don't think Apophis is a problem. In fact  Apophis is a blessing in disguise  because it woke us up to the dangers of these things. This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now. It won't  but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids. We didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes  and now we do and it turns out that's really important  because how do you stop an asteroid like this  Well  let me ask you  what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you  What do you do  You do this. Right  Move. The car goes past you. But we can't move the Earth  at least not easily  but we can move a small asteroid. And it turns out  we've even done it. In the year       NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact  which slammed into    slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet. Comets are very much like asteroids. The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way. The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet  which we learned quite a bit about. We did move the comet a little tiny bit  not very much  but that wasn't the point. However  think about this. This thing is orbiting the sun at    miles per second     miles per second. We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay  Imagine how hard that must be  and we did it. That means we can do it again. If we need  if we see an asteroid that's coming toward us  and it's headed right for us  and we have two years to go  boom  We hit it. You can try to    you know  if you watch the movies  you might think about  why don't we use a nuclear weapon  It's like  well  you can try that  but the problem is timing. You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing  you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you'll just miss it. And there are a lot of other problems with that. It's very hard to do. But just hitting something  That's pretty easy. I think even NASA can do that  and they proved that they can.  Laughter  The problem is  what happens if you hit this asteroid  you've changed the orbit  you measure the orbit and then you find out  oh  yeah  we just pushed it into a keyhole  and now it's going to hit us in three years. Well  my opinion is  fine. Okay  It's not hitting us in six months. That's good. Now we have three years to do something else. And you can hit it again. That's kind of ham fisted. You might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever  so you don't do that. And this is the part  it's the part I just love. After the big macho  Rrrrrrr BAM  We're gonna hit this thing in the face   then we bring in the velvet gloves. There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B    Foundation. For those of you who've read  The Little Prince   you understand that reference  I hope. The little prince who lived on an asteroid  it was called B   . These are smart guys    men and women    astronauts  like I said  engineers. Rusty Schweickart  who was an Apollo   astronaut  is on this. Dan Durda  my friend who made this image  works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder  on Walnut Street. He created this image for this  and he's actually one of the astronomers who works for them. If we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth and we have enough time  we can hit it to move it into a better orbit. But then what we do is we launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two. It doesn't have to be huge    couple of tons  not that big    and you park it near the asteroid. You don't land on it  because these things are tumbling end over end. It's very hard to land on them. Instead you get near it. The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe  and the probe has a couple of tons of mass. It has a little tiny bit of gravity  but it's enough that it can pull the asteroid  and you have your rockets set up  so you can    oh  you can barely see it here  but there's rocket plumes    and you basically  these guys are connected by their own gravity  and if you move the probe very slowly  very  very gently  you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit. You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it  although that's a whole other thing. I won't go into that. But we'd be rich  So think about this  right  There are these giant rocks flying out there  and they're hitting us  and they're doing damage to us  but we've figured out how to do this  and all the pieces are in place to do this. We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them. We have smart people  very  very smart people  who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem  and we have the technology to do this. This probe actually can't use chemical rockets. Chemical rockets provide too much thrust  too much push. The probe would just shoot away. We invented something called an ion drive  which is a very  very  very low thrust engine. It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand  incredibly light  but it can run for months and years  providing that very gentle push. If anybody here is a fan of the original  Star Trek   they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive  and Spock said   They're very technically sophisticated. They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive.  Yeah  we have an ion drive now.  Laughter  We don't have the Enterprise  but we've got an ion drive now. Spock. So ... that's the difference  that's the difference between us and the dinosaurs. This happened to them. It doesn't have to happen to us. The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote  and so we can change our future. We have the ability to change our future.    million years from now  we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum. Thank you very much. Let me introduce to you Rezero. This little fellow was developed by a group of    undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH Zurich. Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots. Instead of wheels  a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball. The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground. This means that the robot is inherently unstable. It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot. You might ask yourself  what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable  Now we'll explain that in a second. Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance. Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor. He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately. This happens     times per second  and if anything fails in this process  Rezero would immediately fall to the ground. Now to move and to balance  Rezero needs to turn the ball. The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time. Due to his instability  Rezero is always in motion. Now here's the trick. It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very  dynamically . Let's play a little. You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push. In this mode  he's trying to maintain his position. For the next demo  I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael  on the computer  and Thomas who's helping me onstage. In the next mode  Rezero is passive  and we can move him around. With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity. I can also make him spin. In the next mode  we can get Rezero to follow a person. He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas. This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero. With the same method  we can also get him to circle a person. We call this the orbiting mode. All right  thank you  Thomas. Now  what's the use of this technology  For now  it's an experiment  but let me show you some possible future applications. Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks. With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way. In a hospital  this device could be used to carry around medical equipment. Due to the Ballbot system  it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around. And of course  who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these. And these are more practical applications. But there's also a certain beauty within this technology. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen  gather around. I would love to share with you a story. Once upon a time in   th century Germany  there was the book. Now during this time  the book was the king of storytelling. It was venerable. It was ubiquitous. But it was a little bit boring. Because in its     years of existence  storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device. But then one author arrived  and he changed the game forever. His name was Lothar  Lothar Meggendorfer. Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down  and he said   Genug ist genug   He grabbed his pen  he snatched his scissors. This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold. History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as    who else     the world's first true inventor of the children's pop up book. For this delight and for this wonder  people rejoiced. They were happy because the story survived  and that the world would keep on spinning. Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told  and he certainly wasn't the last. Whether storytellers realized it or not  they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville  radio news to radio theater  film to film in motion to film in sound  color   D  on VHS and on DVD. There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis. And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around. Because  not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world  but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices. For example  one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine. One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in  D. And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate. And after all this  everyone paused  they took a step back. They realized that  in       years of storytelling  they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls. And this was a cause for celebration. The art of storytelling has remained unchanged. And for the most part  the stories are recycled. But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure  consistent novelty. And they remembered a man  one amazing German  every time a new storytelling device popped up next. And for that  the audience    the lovely  beautiful audience    would live happily ever after. I  like many of you  am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities. And there are days    I don't know about the rest of you guys    but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life. And some days  that can even be a little scary. But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues  if we apply open source collaboration. A couple of years ago  I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment. Now at the time that I was reading this  it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment. So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future. But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article    was it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system. So  I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space. And you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high quality liquid soil over plants' root systems. Now to a vegetable plant  my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space. But I can offer some natural light and year round climate control. Fast forward two years later  we now have window farms  which are vertical  hydroponic platforms for food growing indoors. And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom  which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top  which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets    so there's no dirt involved. Now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate  so a window farm requires a farmer  and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm  and whether she is going to feed her food organically. Back at the time  a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing. And I really wanted it to be an open project  because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Monsanto  where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food. So I decided that  instead of creating a product  what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co developers. The first few systems that we created  they kind of worked. We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window. And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers  all kinds of stuff. But the first few systems were these leaky  loud power guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved. So to bring on more co developers  what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs  we explained how they worked  and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems. And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us. So actually now on this website  we have        people. And we have window farms all over the world. What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R D  or research and development. But what we call it is R D I Y  or research and develop it yourself. So for example  Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps. It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right  but once we did  we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half. Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments  like lots of other window farmers  and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients. And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project. So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software. And with every open source project  the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns. So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone. And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers. So for do it yourselfers  we provide free  very well tested instructions so that anyone  anywhere around the world  can build one of these systems for free. And there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community. And to fund the project  we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don't have time to build their own systems. Now within our community  a certain culture has appeared. In our culture  it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy. What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work  as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs. But I think that Eileen expresses best what we really get out of this  which is the actual joy of collaboration. So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea  built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing. If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people  maybe we just need to ditch the term  consumer  and get behind the people who are doing stuff. Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own. And what we're seeing is that R D I Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems. And we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us. And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now. So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united  and to declare that we are all still pioneers. If your life were a book and you were the author  how would you want your story to go  That's the question that changed my life forever. Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert  all I wanted was to be free. I would daydream about traveling the world  living in a place where it snowed  and I would picture all of the stories that I would go on to tell. At the age of     the day after I graduated high school  I moved to a place where it snowed and I became a massage therapist. With this job all I needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and I could go anywhere. For the first time in my life  I felt free  independent and completely in control of my life. That is  until my life took a detour. I went home from work early one day with what I thought was the flu  and less than    hours later I was in the hospital on life support with less than a two percent chance of living. It wasn't until days later as I lay in a coma that the doctors diagnosed me with bacterial meningitis  a vaccine preventable blood infection. Over the course of two and a half months I lost my spleen  my kidneys  the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee. When my parents wheeled me out of the hospital I felt like I had been pieced back together like a patchwork doll. I thought the worst was over until weeks later when I saw my new legs for the first time. The calves were bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles and a yellow rubber foot with a raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle to look like a vein. I didn't know what to expect  but I wasn't expecting that. With my mom by my side and tears streaming down our faces  I strapped on these chunky legs and I stood up. They were so painful and so confining that all I could think was  how am I ever going to travel the world in these things  How was I ever going to live the life full of adventure and stories  as I always wanted  And how was I going to snowboard again  That day  I went home  I crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months  me passed out  escaping from reality  with my legs resting by my side. I was absolutely physically and emotionally broken. But I knew that in order to move forward  I had to let go of the old Amy and learn to embrace the new Amy. And that is when it dawned on me that I didn't have to be five foot five anymore. I could be as tall as I wanted  Or as short as I wanted  depending on who I was dating. And if I snowboarded again  my feet aren't going to get cold. And best of all  I thought  I can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales rack.  Laughter  And I did  So there were benefits here. It was this moment that I asked myself that life defining question  If my life were a book and I were the author  how would I want the story to go  And I began to daydream. I daydreamed like I did as a little girl and I imagined myself walking gracefully  helping other people through my journey and snowboarding again. And I didn't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder  I could actually feel it. I could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment. And that is when a new chapter in my life began. Four months later I was back up on a snowboard  although things didn't go quite as expected  My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend and at one point I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when I fell and my legs  still attached to my snowboard   went flying down the mountain  and I was on top of the mountain still. I was so shocked  I was just as shocked as everybody else  and I was so discouraged  but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet that I would be able to do this again. And this is when I learned that our borders and our obstacles can only do two things  one  stop us in our tracks or two  force us to get creative. I did a year of research  still couldn't figure out what kind of legs to use  couldn't find any resources that could help me. So I decided to make a pair myself. My leg maker and I put random parts together and we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in. As you can see  rusted bolts  rubber  wood and neon pink duct tape. And yes  I can change my toenail polish. It was these legs and the best   st birthday gift I could ever receive   a new kidney from my dad   that allowed me to follow my dreams again. I started snowboarding  then I went back to work  then I went back to school. Then in      I cofounded a nonprofit organization for youth and young adults with physical disabilities so they could get involved with action sports. From there  I had the opportunity to go to South Africa  where I helped to put shoes on thousands of children's feet so they could attend school. And just this past February  I won two back to back World Cup gold medals   which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world. Eleven years ago  when I lost my legs  I had no idea what to expect. But if you ask me today  if I would ever want to change my situation  I would have to say no. Because my legs haven't disabled me  if anything they've enabled me. They've forced me to rely on my imagination and to believe in the possibilities  and that's why I believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for breaking through borders  because in our minds  we can do anything and we can be anything. It's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head on that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits. And although today is about innovation without borders  I have to say that in my life  innovation has only been possible because of my borders. I've learned that borders are where the actual ends  but also where the imagination and the story begins. So the thought that I would like  to challenge you with today is that maybe instead of looking at  our challenges and our limitations as something negative or bad  we can begin to look at them as blessings  magnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations and help us go further than we ever knew we could go. It's not about breaking down borders. It's about pushing off of them and seeing what amazing places they might bring us. Thank you. Meet Tony. He's my student. He's about my age  and he's in San Quentin State Prison. When Tony was    years old  one day  one moment   It was mom's gun. Just flash it  scare the guy. He's a punk. He took some money  we'll take his money. That'll teach him. Then last minute  I'm thinking  'Can't do this. This is wrong.' My buddy says  'C'mon  let's do this.' I say  'Let's do this.'  And those three words  Tony's going to remember  because the next thing he knows  he hears the pop. There's the punk on the ground  puddle of blood. And that's felony murder       to life  parole at    if you're lucky  and Tony's not feeling very lucky. So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say   In this class  we will discuss the foundations of ethics   Tony interrupts me.  What are you going to teach me about right and wrong  I know what is wrong. I have done wrong. I am told every day  by every face I see  every wall I face  that I am wrong. If I ever get out of here  there will always be a mark by my name. I'm a convict  I am branded 'wrong.' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong   So I say to Tony   Sorry  but it's worse than you think. You think you know right and wrong  Then can you tell me what wrong is  No  don't just give me an example. I want to know about wrongness itself  the idea of wrong. What is that idea  What makes something wrong  How do we know that it's wrong  Maybe you and I disagree. Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong. Maybe it's you  maybe it's me    but we're not here to trade opinions  everyone's got an opinion. We are here for knowledge. Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy.  And something changes for Tony.  Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong. I want to know what is wrong. I want to know what I know.  What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy  the project that begins in wonder    what Kant called  admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within.  What can creatures like us know of such things  It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence    what Heidegger called  the always already there.  It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it    what Socrates called  the examined life.  Socrates  a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing. Socrates died in prison  his philosophy intact. So Tony starts doing his homework. He learns his whys and wherefores  his causes and correlations  his logic  his fallacies. Turns out  Tony's got the philosophy muscle. His body is in prison  but his mind is free. Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous  the epistemologically anxious  the ethically dubious  the metaphysically ridiculous. That's Plato  Descartes  Nietzsche and Bill Clinton. So when he gives me his final paper  in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure  I say   I don't know. Let us think about that.  Because in that moment  there's no mark by Tony's name  it's just the two of us standing there. It is not professor and convict  it is just two minds ready to do philosophy. And I say to Tony   Let's do this.  Thank you. My subject today is learning. And in that spirit  I want to spring on you all a pop quiz. Ready  When does learning begin  Now as you ponder that question  maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten  the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher. Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork. Maybe you've encountered the Zero to Three movement  which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones. And so your answer to my question would be  Learning begins at birth. Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible  but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology. And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we're born  while we're still in the womb. Now I'm a science reporter. I write books and magazine articles. And I'm also a mother. And those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called  Origins.   Origins  is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins. Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago  and it's based on the theory that our health and well being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb. Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me. I was myself pregnant while I was doing the research for the book. And one of the most fascinating insights I took from this work is that we're all learning about the world even before we enter it. When we hold our babies for the first time  we might imagine that they're clean slates  unmarked by life  when in fact  they've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in. Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they're still in their mothers' bellies. First of all  they learn the sound of their mothers' voices. Because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus  the voices fetuses hear  starting around the fourth month of gestation  are muted and muffled. One researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher in the old  Peanuts  cartoon. But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body  reaching the fetus much more readily. And because the fetus is with her all the time  it hears her voice a lot. Once the baby's born  it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else's. How can we know this  Newborn babies can't do much  but one thing they're really good at is sucking. Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples  so that if a baby sucks on one  it hears a recording of its mother's voice on a pair of headphones  and if it sucks on the other nipple  it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice. Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one. Scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored. This is how researchers discovered that  after women repeatedly read aloud a section of Dr. Seuss'  The Cat in the Hat  while they were pregnant  their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it outside the womb. My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born. So fetuses are even learning about the particular language that's spoken in the world that they'll be born into. A study published last year found that from birth  from the moment of birth  babies cry in the accent of their mother's native language. French babies cry on a rising note while German babies end on a falling note  imitating the melodic contours of those languages. Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful  It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival. From the moment of birth  the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it    its mother. It even makes its cries sound like the mother's language  which may further endear the baby to the mother  and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language. But it's not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero. It's also tastes and smells. By seven months of gestation  the fetus' taste buds are fully developed  and its olfactory receptors  which allow it to smell  are functioning. The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid  which is continuously swallowed by the fetus. Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they're out in the world. In one experiment  a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy  while another group of pregnant women drank only water. Six months later  the women's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice  and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it. The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot flavored cereal  and from the looks of it  they seemed to enjoy it more. A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon  France where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice flavored anise during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life  and again  when they were tested later  on their fourth day of life. Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as  yuck.  What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat. Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they'll be joining through one of culture's most powerful expressions  which is food. They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture's cuisine even before birth. Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons. But before I get to that  I want to address something that you may be wondering about. The notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus    like playing Mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly. But actually  the nine month long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that. Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life    the air she breathes  the food and drink she consumes  the chemicals she's exposed to  even the emotions she feels    are shared in some fashion with her fetus. They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself. The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body  makes them part of its flesh and blood. And often it does something more. It treats these maternal contributions as information  as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside. So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart's  Magic Flute  but answers to questions much more critical to its survival. Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity  Will it be safe and protected  or will it face constant dangers and threats  Will it live a long  fruitful life or a short  harried one  The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind. The resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus' brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility  our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments  from the country to the city  from the tundra to the desert. To conclude  I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they're born. In the autumn of       the darkest days of World War II  German troops blockaded Western Holland  turning away all shipments of food. The opening of the Nazi's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades    so cold the water in the canals froze solid. Soon food became scarce  with many Dutch surviving on just     calories a day    a quarter of what they consumed before the war. As weeks of deprivation stretched into months  some resorted to eating tulip bulbs. By the beginning of May  the nation's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted. The specter of mass starvation loomed. And then on May  th        the siege came to a sudden end when Holland was liberated by the Allies. The  Hunger Winter   as it came to be known  killed some        people and weakened thousands more. But there was another population that was affected    the        fetuses in utero during the siege. Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths  birth defects  low birth weights and infant mortality. But others wouldn't be discovered for many years. Decades after the  Hunger Winter   researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity  more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions. These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways. They have higher blood pressure  poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance    a precursor of diabetes. Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later  One explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation. When food is scarce  they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ  the brain  and away from other organs like the heart and liver. This keeps the fetus alive in the short term  but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs  deprived early on  become more susceptible to disease. But that may not be all that's going on. It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly. They're preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb. The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it. And the basis of the fetus' prediction is what its mother eats. The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story  a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation. This story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems    an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival. Faced with severely limited resources  a smaller sized child with reduced energy requirements will  in fact  have a better chance of living to adulthood. The real trouble comes when pregnant women are  in a sense  unreliable narrators  when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty. This is what happened to the children of the Dutch  Hunger Winter.  And their higher rates of obesity  diabetes and heart disease are the result. Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post war Western diet. The world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born. Here's another story. At      a.m. on September   th        there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York    commuters spilling off trains  waitresses setting tables for the morning rush  brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.       of these people were pregnant women. When the planes struck and the towers collapsed  many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster    the overwhelming chaos and confusion  the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris  the heart pounding fear for their lives. About a year after       researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack. In the babies of those women who developed post traumatic stress syndrome  or PTSD  following their ordeal  researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to PTSD    an effect that was most pronounced in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester. In other words  the mothers with post traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero. Now consider this  post traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong  causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering. But there's another way of thinking about PTSD. What looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances. In a particularly dangerous environment  the characteristic manifestations of PTSD    a hyper awareness of one's surroundings  a quick trigger response to danger    could save someone's life. The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive is still speculative  but I find it rather poignant. It would mean that  even before birth  mothers are warning their children that it's a wild world out there  telling them   Be careful.  Let me be clear. Fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy. It's about discovering how best to promote the health and well being of the next generation. That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb. Learning is one of life's most essential activities  and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined. Thank you. Good afternoon. As you're all aware  we face difficult economic times. I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden. This idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT. He was struggling to explain something to me  a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter. Now he confused me from the very start  because light doesn't cool things down. It makes it hotter. It's happening right now. The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than     quintillion photons  and they're moving randomly through the space  near the speed of light. All of them are different colors  they're rippling with different frequencies  and they're bouncing off every surface  including me  and some of those are flying directly into your eyes  and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here. Now a laser is different. It also uses photons  but they're all synchronized  and if you focus them into a beam  what you have is an incredibly useful tool. The control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye  you can use it to store massive amounts of data  and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain. First you trap atoms in a special bottle. It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment. And the atoms themselves are quite violent  but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency  an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down. Little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero. Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough  something truly bizarre happens. It's no longer a solid  a liquid or a gas. It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid. The atoms lose their individual identity  and the rules from the quantum world take over  and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties. For example  if you shine light through a superfluid  it is able to slow photons down to    kilometers per hour. Another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction  so if you were to take the lid off that bottle  it won't stay inside. A thin film will creep up the inside wall  flow over the top and right out the outside. Now of course  the moment that it does hit the outside environment  and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree  it immediately turns back into normal matter. Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered. And this is the great pleasure of science  the defeat of our intuition through experimentation. But the experiment is not the end of the story  because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people. I have a Ph.D in molecular biology. I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about. So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment  it seemed like the more he said  the less I understood. Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea  to really capture its essence  the fewer words you use  the better. In fact  the ideal may be to use no words at all. I remember thinking  my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance. Of course  there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them. Now  the idea is not as crazy as it sounds. I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D. Instead of explaining their research with words  scientists have to explain it with dance. Now surprisingly  it seems to work. Dance really can make science easier to understand. But don't take my word for it. Go on the Internet and search for  Dance Your Ph.D.  There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you. The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research. For example  at the University of Minnesota  there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde  and he works with dancers to study how cells move. They do it by changing their shape. When a chemical signal washes up on one side  it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side  because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment. So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions. But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside  because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers  and those fibers are constantly falling apart. But just as quickly as they explode  more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer  so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. Now  David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab  but before he does that  he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place. It's basically efficient brainstorming  and when I visited David to learn about his research  he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method  PowerPoint. And this brings me to my modest proposal. I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy. Now it does depend on how you measure it  of course  but one estimate has put the drain at     million dollars per day. Now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of        dollars  and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time  and given that there are some apparently    million PowerPoint presentations created every day  that would indeed add up to an annual waste of     billion dollars. Of course  that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations. There are other costs  because PowerPoint is a tool  and like any tool  it can and will be abused. To borrow a concept from my country's CIA  it helps you to soften up your audience. It distracts them with pretty pictures  irrelevant data. It allows you to create the illusion of competence  the illusion of simplicity  and most destructively  the illusion of understanding. So now my country is    trillion dollars in debt. Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money. One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts. For example  our National Endowment for the Arts  with its      million budget  slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one thousandth of a percent. One certainly can't argue with those numbers. However  once we eliminate public funding for the arts  there will be some drawbacks. The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed. Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution  and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods. All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place. I shall now  therefore  humbly propose my own thoughts  which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. Once we eliminate public funding for the artists  let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint. As a test case  I propose we start with American dancers. After all  they are the most perishable of their kind  prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system. Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds  we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems. Imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank. It's sure to help. Of course someday  in the deep future  a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented  rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric. However  I trust that by that day  we shall have passed this present financial calamity. Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion. Now when we think of our senses  we don't usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved  from a biological perspective. We don't really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses  but that's probably why our senses really evolved    to keep us safe  to allow us to live. Really when we think of our senses  or when we think of the loss of the sense  we really think about something more like this  the ability to touch something luxurious  to taste something delicious  to smell something fragrant  to see something beautiful. This is what we want out of our senses. We want beauty  we don't just want function. And when it comes to sensory restoration  we're still very far away from being able to provide beauty. And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today. Likewise for hearing. When we think about why we hear  we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren  although clearly that's an important thing. Really what we want to hear is music. So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. Many of you know that he was deaf  or near profoundly deaf  when he wrote that. Now I'd like to impress upon you how unusual it is that we can hear music. Music is just one of the strangest things that there is. It's acoustic vibrations in the air  little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum. Somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones  which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music. That process is entirely abstract and very  very unusual. And we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out  how is it that we hear something that's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air  Turns out that if you have hearing loss  most people that lose their hearing lose it at what's called the cochlea  the inner ear. And it's at the hair cell level that they do this. Now if you had to pick a sense to lose  I have to be very honest with you and say  we're better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is. In fact  nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing. And as a physician and a surgeon  I can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose  we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing. As a musician  I can tell you that if I had to have a cochlear implant  I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken  because I know that music would never sound the same to me. Now this is a video that I'm going to show you of a girl who's born deaf. She's in a very supportive environment. Her mother's doing everything she can. Okay  play that video please. Owl  yeah. Owl. Owl. Yeah. Baby. Baby. You want it  Charles Limb  Now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning  there is a limitation to what a child who's deaf  an infant who was born deaf  has in this world in terms of social  educational  vocational opportunities. I'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful  wonderful life. I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face. Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past     years. I mean literally  they used to do things like stick ear shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in. And that was the best you could do for hearing loss. Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum. So it's not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss. And now today we have the modern multi channel cochlear implant  which is an outpatient procedure. It's surgically placed inside the inner ear. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours  depending on where it's done  under general anesthesia. And in the end  you achieve something like this where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea. Now actually  this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear. But here is that same girl who is implanted now. This is her    years later. And this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor  Dr. John Niparko  who implanted her. If we could play this video please. Girl  I have written two books.  Mother  Was the other one a book or a journal entry   Girl  No  the other one was a book.  Mother  Oh  okay.  JN  Well this book has seven chapters  and the last chapter is entitled  The Good Things About Being Deaf.  Do you remember writing that chapter  Girl  Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter. JN  Yeah. Girl  Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying. So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her. JN  I see. And who is that  Girl  Holly.  JN  Okay.  Mother  Her sister.  JN  Her sister.  Girl  My sister. JN  And how can you avoid being annoyed by her  Girl  I just take off my CI  and I don't hear anything. It comes in handy. JN  So you don't want to hear everything that's out there  Girl  No. CL  And so she's phenomenal. And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success. It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine. However  despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language  you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all. In fact  most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad. And so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody's life  we have a long way to go when it comes to audition. Now there are a lot of reasons for that. I mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it's abstract. Language is very different. Language is very precise. In fact  the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic specificity. When you say a word  what you care is that word was perceived correctly. You don't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken. Music is entirely different. When you hear music  if it doesn't sound good  what's the point  There's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn't sound good to you. The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language. And you can see on this figure  that the frequency range and the decibel range  the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous. So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant  what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission. Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing. If you can hear music  you should be able to hear anything. Now the problems begin first with pitch perception. I mean  most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music. And without the ability to perceive pitch well  music and melody is a very difficult thing to do    forget about a harmony and things like that. Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude. Now if we could just play this. Okay  now if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves  let's see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone. We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users. Go ahead and play this one. Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation. You distort it a little bit  especially in terms of pitch  and you've changed it. And it might be that you kind of like that. That's kind of hypnotic. But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended. And you're not hearing the same thing that most people who have normal hearing are hearing. Now the other issue comes with  not just the ability to tell pitches apart  but the ability to tell sounds apart. Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument. If we could play these two sound clips in succession. The trumpet. And the second one. That's a violin. These have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments. Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments. The sound quality  or the sound of the sound is how I like to describe timbre  tone color    they cannot tell these things whatsoever. This implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth. Now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant and you have them listen to speech  have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody  what you find is that the auditory cortex is the most active during speech. You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech  they were designed for speech. But actually if you look at melody  what you find is that there's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls. So for whatever reason  this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception. Now the next question is  well how does it really sound  Now we've been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users. I'm going to play you two clips of Usher  one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies  almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies. Go ahead and play that. I had patients tell me that those sound the same. They cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips. Again  we are very  very far away in just getting to where we want to get to. Now the question comes to mind  Is there any hope  And yes  there is hope. Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is. This is ... does somebody know  This is Beethoven. Now why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like  Because his grave was exhumed. And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness  which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there. But Beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing. What that suggests is that  even in the case of hearing loss  the capacity for music remains. The brains remain hardwired for music. I've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo where I've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants. This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food. Text  Beethoven doesn't excite her. The       Overture  isn't worth waking for. But she jumps to action when called to duty  CL  Now I'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it. I'm suggesting that with training you can imbue a musical sound with significance  even in a cat. If we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music    because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that  no rehabilitative strategies  very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music    we would come a long way. Now I want to show you one last video. And this is of a student of mine named Joseph who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab. He's deaf  and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant. And here's a video of Joseph. And at about four months old  I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss. Not long after  I was fitted with hearing aids. But although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time  they weren't very helpful. So as a result  I had to rely on lip reading a lot  and I couldn't really hear what people were saying. When I was    years old  I was one of the first few people in Singapore who underwent cochlear implantation. And not long after I got my cochlear implant  I started learning how to play piano. And it was absolutely wonderful. Since then  I've never looked back. CL  Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant. He is now a medical student at Yale University  and he's contemplating a surgical career    one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery. There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere. And this is really unheard of stuff  and this is all because of this technology. And the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain. Truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant  because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time. You don't actually have to hear it. I know he doesn't hear well  because I've heard him do Karaoke. And it's one of the most awful things    heartwarming  but awful. And so there is certainly a lot of hope  but there's a lot more that needs to be done. So I just want to conclude with the following words. When it comes to restoration of hearing  we have certainly come a long way  a remarkably long way. And we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing. And let me tell you right now  it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech. But I tell you  if we lost our hearing  if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing  you would want perfect hearing back. You wouldn't want decent hearing  you would want perfect hearing. Restoration of basic sensory function is critical. And I don't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function. But it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring. And I don't think that we should give up on beauty. And I want to thank you for your time. So that's Johnny Depp  of course. And that's Johnny Depp's shoulder. And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo. Some of you might know that  in       Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder  and he had tattooed on his right shoulder  Winona forever.  And then three years later    which in fairness  kind of is forever by Hollywood standards    they broke up  and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done. And now his shoulder says   Wino forever.  So like Johnny Depp  and like    percent of Americans between the ages of    and     I have a tattoo. I first started thinking about getting it in my mid   s  but I deliberately waited a really long time. Because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were    or    or    and regretted it by the time they were   . That didn't happen to me. I got my tattoo when I was     and I regretted it instantly. And by  regretted it   I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place    this is just a couple miles from here down on the Lower East Side    and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street. Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares. And then I went home that night  and I had an even larger emotional meltdown  which I'll say more about in a minute. And this was all actually quite shocking to me  because prior to this moment  I had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets. I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions  of course. I do that hourly. But I had always felt like  look  you know  I made the best choice I could make given who I was then  given the information I had on hand. I learned a lesson from it. It somehow got me to where I am in life right now. And okay  I wouldn't change it. In other words  I had drunk our great cultural Kool Aid about regret  which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time  that we should always look forward and not backward  and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets. This idea is nicely captured by this quote   Things without all remedy should be without regard  what's done is done.  And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first    something we might all agree to sign onto ... until I tell you who said it. Right  so this is Lady MacBeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people. And as it happens  Shakespeare was onto something here  as he generally was. Because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths. It's also  by the way  a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage. So people who have damage to their orbital frontal cortex seem to be unable to feel regret in the face of even obviously very poor decisions. So if  in fact  you want to live a life free of regret  there is an option open to you. It's called a lobotomy. But if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane  I think you need to learn to live  not without regret  but with it. So let's start off by defining some terms. What is regret  Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past. So in other words  regret requires two things. It requires  first of all  agency    we had to make a decision in the first place. And second of all  it requires imagination. We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice  and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present. And in fact  the more we have of either of these things    the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret  the more acute that regret will be. So let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic  and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight. You're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by   . Why  Well because  if you miss your flight by three minutes  it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome.  I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel. I should have gone through that yellow light.  These are the classic conditions that create regret. We feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly  but almost came out well. Now within that framework  we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things. This session today is about behavioral economics. And most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain. We have a vast body of literature on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them    buyer's remorse  basically. But then finally  it occurred to some researchers to step back and say  well okay  but overall  what do we regret most in life  Here's what the answers turn out to look like. So top six regrets    the things we regret most in life  Number one by far  education.    percent of all of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education. We wish we'd gotten more of it. We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have. We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic. Others very high on our list of regrets include career  romance  parenting  various decisions and choices about our sense of self and how we spend our leisure time    or actually more specifically  how we fail to spend our leisure time. The remaining regrets pertain to these things  finance  family issues unrelated to romance or parenting  health  friends  spirituality and community. So in other words  we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance. But it turns out  when you look overall at what people regret in life  you know what  our financial decisions don't even rank. They account for less than three percent of our total regrets. So if you're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap  or company A versus company B  or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius  you know what  let it go. Odds are  you're not going to care in five years. But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around  what does that experience feel like  We all know the short answer. It feels terrible. Regret feels awful. But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways. So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial. When I went home that night after getting my tattoo  I basically stayed up all night. And for the first several hours  there was exactly one thought in my head. And the thought was   Make it go away   This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response. I mean  it's right up there with   I want my mommy   We're not trying to solve the problem. We're not trying to understand how the problem came about. We just want it to vanish. The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment. So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night was   How could I have done that  What was I thinking   This real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret. We can't identify with that part. We don't understand that part. And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part    which explains the third consistent component of regret  which is an intense desire to punish ourselves. That's why  in the face of our regret  the thing we consistently say is   I could have kicked myself.  The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative. To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing. Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop. So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night  thinking   Make it go away.  It's that I sat there and I thought   Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away.  So if you look at the psychological literature  these are the four consistent defining components of regret. But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one. And I think of this as a kind of existential wake up call. That night in my apartment  after I got done kicking myself and so forth  I lay in bed for a long time  and I thought about skin grafts. And then I thought about how  much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God  probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy. In point of fact  no insurance covers acts of idiocy. The whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured  they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of  frankly  a fairly indifferent universe. This is obviously an incredibly painful experience. And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West in the grips of what I sometimes think of as a Control Z culture    Control Z like the computer command  undo. We're incredibly used to not having to face life's hard realities  in a certain sense. We think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem    we can undo and unfriend and unfollow. And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot. Sometimes instead of Control Z  we actually have zero control. And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists    and I know where of I speak    this is really hard  because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right. Now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos  and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes. But first I want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about. So for instance  here's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life. Text  Relpy to all. And the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing  we can experience a huge range of regret. You can accidentally hit  reply all  to an email and torpedo a relationship. Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work. Or you can have your last day at work. And this doesn't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life. Because of course  sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences  either for our own or for other people's health and happiness and livelihoods  and in the very worst case scenario  even their lives. Now obviously  those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring. I mean  even the stupid  reply all  regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days. So how are we supposed to live with this  I want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret. And the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality. If you Google regret and tattoo  you will get   .  million hits. The FDA estimates that of all the Americans who have tattoos     percent of us regret getting them. That is Johnny Depp and me and our seven million friends. And that's just regret about tattoos. We are all in this together. The second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves. Now in my case  this really wasn't a problem  because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're    years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo. But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets. I don't think that's the case though. All of us who've experienced regret that contains real pain and real grief understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive. It connects the poles of our lives back together  the positive and the negative  and it sends a little current of life back into us. The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret is through the passage of time  which  as we know  heals all wounds    except for tattoos  which are permanent. So it's been several years since I got my own tattoo. And do you guys just want to see it  All right. Actually  you know what  I should warn you  you're going to be disappointed. Because it's actually not that hideous. I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something. When other people see my tattoo  for the most part they like how it looks. It's just that I don't like how it looks. And as I said earlier  I'm a perfectionist. But I'll let you see it anyway. This is my tattoo. I can guess what some of you are thinking. So let me reassure you about something. Some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are. I got this tattoo because I spent most of my   s living outside the country and traveling. And when I came and settled in New York afterward  I was worried that I would forget some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time. Specifically the two things I learned about myself that I most didn't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and  simultaneously  how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north. And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image. And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device. Well it did. But it turns out  it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would  it reminds me constantly of something else instead. It actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us  which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us. And ironically  I think it's probably the single most important thing I possibly could have tattooed onto my body    partly as a writer  but also just as a human being. Here's the thing  if we have goals and dreams  and we want to do our best  and if we love people and we don't want to hurt them or lose them  we should feel pain when things go wrong. The point isn't to live without any regrets. The point is to not hate ourselves for having them. The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo and that I want to leave you with today is this  We need to learn to love the flawed  imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them. Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly. It reminds us that we know we can do better. Thank you. Good afternoon  I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow. I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can  and actually is changing the world  and whose name is people power. I'll start with an anecdote  or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers  a Monty Python type of sketch. Here it is. It is December         . Somebody gives you a bet  you will look at a crystal ball  and you will see the future  the future will be accurate. But you need to share it with the world. OK  curiosity killed the cat  you take the bet  you look at the crystal ball. One hour later  you're sitting in a building of the national TV  in a top show  and you tell the story. Before the end of       Ben Ali  and Mubarak  and Gaddafi would be down  and prosecuted. Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria would be either challenged  or already on their knees. Osama bin Laden would be dead  and Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague. Now  the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face. And then  on top of it you add   And thousands of young people from Athens  Madrid and New York will demonstrate for social justice  claiming they are inspired by Arabs.  Next thing you know  two guys in white appear  they give you the strange t shirt  take you to the nearest mental institution. So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be a very bad year for bad guys. And this phenomenon is called people power. Well  people power has been there for a while. It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India  it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle. It helped a local  Lech Walesa  to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland  and in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it. So what's new in it  What seems to be very new  which is the idea I would like to share with you today  is that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle. If this is true  we can help these movements. Well  the first one   analytic skills. I'll try where it all started in the Middle East. And for so many years  we were living with a completely wrong perception of the Middle East. It was looking like the frozen region. Literally a refrigerator. And there were only two types of meal there. Steak  which stands for a Mubarak Ben Ali type of military police dictatorship  or a potato  which stands for a Tehran type of theocracies. And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened  and millions of young  mainly secular people stepped out to do the change. Guess what   they didn't watch the demographics. What is the average age of an Egyptian    . How long was Mubarak in power    . So  this system was just obsolete  they expired. And young people of the Arab world have awakened one morning  and understood that power lies in their hands. The rest is the year in front of us. And guess what  The same Generation Y  with their rules  with their tools  with their games  and with their language  which sounds a little bit strange to me. I'm    now. And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe  It seems that Generation Y is coming. Now  let me set another example. I'm meeting different people throughout the world  and they are  you know  academics  and professors  and doctors  and they will always talk conditions. They will say   People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive.  They will say   People power will work  if the annual income of the country is between X and Z.  They will say   People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure.  They will say   People power will work only if there is no oil.  And  I mean  there is a set of conditions. Well  the news here is that your skills during the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions. Namely  the skills of unity  planning  and maintaining nonviolent discipline. Let me give you an example. I come from a country called Serbia. It took us    years to unite    opposition party leaders  with their big egos  behind one single candidate against the Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic. Guess what  That was the day of his defeat. You look at the Egyptians  they fight on Tahrir Square  they get rid of their individual symbols  they appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt. I will give you a counter example. You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko  you all know the outcome. So unity is a big thing. And this can be achieved. Same with planning. Somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution. That thing doesn't exist in the world. Whenever you see young people in front of the row trying to fraternize with the police or military  somebody was thinking about it before. Now  at the end  nonviolent discipline. And this is probably the game changer. If you maintain nonviolent discipline  you'll exclusively win. You have         people in a nonviolent march  one idiot or agent provocateur throwing a stone. Guess what takes all the cameras. That one guy. One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement. Now  let me move to another place. It's the selection of strategies and tactics. There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow. First  you start small. Second  you pick the battles you can win. It's only     of us in this room. We won't call for the march of a million. But what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night  all over Krakow. The city will know. So  we pick tactics accommodated to the event  especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion. They're very useful in violent oppression. We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used. It was on Tahrir square  where the international community was constantly frightened that  you know  the Islamists will overtake the revolution. What they organized    Christians protecting Muslims where they are praying  a Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims  the world has just changed the picture  but somebody was thinking about this previously. So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place  shouting  and you know  showing off in front of the security forces. Now  there is also another very important dynamic. And this is a dynamic that analysts normally don't see. This is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side  and enthusiasm and humor on another side. So  it works like in a video game. You have the fear high  you have status quo. You have the enthusiasm higher  you see the fear is starting to melt. Day two  you see people running towards the police instead of from the police  in Egypt. You can tell that something is happening there. And then  it's about the humor. Humor is such a powerful game changer  and of course  it was very big in Poland. You know  we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit. We put the big petrol barrel with a portrait of Mr. President on it  in the middle of the Main Street. There was a hole in the top. So you could literally come  put a coin in  get a baseball bat  and hit his face. Sounds loud. And within minutes  we were sitting in a nearby caf  having coffee  and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing. Well  that's just the beginning of the show. The real show starts when the police appears.  What will they do   Arrest us  We were nowhere to be seen. We were like three blocks away  observing it from our espresso bar. Arrest the shoppers  with kids  Doesn't make sense. Of course  you could bet  they did the most stupid thing. They arrested the barrel. And now  the picture of the smashed face on the barrel  with the policemen dragging it to the police car  that was the best day for newspaper photographers that they will ever have. So  I mean  these are the things you can do. And you can always use humor. There is also one big thing about humor  it really hurts. Because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously. When you start to mock them  it hurts. Now  everybody is talking about His Majesty  the Internet  and it is also a very useful skill. But don't rush to label things like  a Facebook Revolution    Twitter Revolution.  Don't  confuse  the tools with the substance. It is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper. They also make it a bit safer for the participants  because they give partial anonymity. We're watching the great example of something else the Internet can do. It can put the price tag of state sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester. This is the famous group  We are all Khaled Said   made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt  and his friend. This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police. This is how he became known to the public  and this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel's back. But here is also the bad news. The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world  in the streets. You will never change your society towards democracy  or  you know  the economy  if you sit down and click. There are risks to be taken  and there are living people who are winning the struggle. Well  the million dollar question. What will happen in the Arab world  And though young people from the Arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators  shaking the region  kind of persuading the clever kings from Jordan and Morocco to do substantial reforms  it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome. Whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition  or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts  whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline  faced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already  or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war. Will these revolutions be pushed through the transitions and democracy or be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds  We cannot tell. The same works for the Western sector  where you can see all these excited young people protesting around the world  occupying this  occupying that. Are they going to become the world wave  Are they going to find their skills  their enthusiasm  and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform  or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate  This is the difference between the two paths. Now  what do the statistics have  My friend Maria Stephan's book talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle  and there are some shocking data. If you look at the last    years and different social transitions  from dictatorship to democracy  you will see that  out of    different cases  in    of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power. This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon  this is one more reason to look at Generation Y. Enough for me to give them credit  and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world. Thank you. How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you've been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this  How many of you found it really  really annoying  Okay  outstanding. So I invented that. Or I was one of the people who did it. That thing is called a CAPTCHA. And the reason it is there is to make sure you  the entity filling out the form  are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times. The reason it works is because humans  at least non visually impaired humans  have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters  whereas computer programs simply can't do it as well yet. So for example  in the case of Ticketmaster  the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets  two at a time. CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet. And since they're used so often  a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate. So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page. The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W  A  I  T  which  of course  spell a word. But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about    minutes later. Text   Help  I've been waiting for over    minutes  and nothing happens.  This person thought they needed to wait. This of course  is not as bad as this poor person. CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over    years ago  and it's been used everywhere. Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later  which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA. This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA  which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon  then we turned it into a startup company. And then about a year and a half ago  Google actually acquired this company. So let me tell you what this project started. So this project started from the following realization  It turns out that approximately     million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world. When I first heard this  I was quite proud of myself. I thought  look at the impact that my research has had. But then I started feeling bad. See here's the thing  each time you type a CAPTCHA  essentially you waste    seconds of your time. And if you multiply that by     million  you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about         hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs. So then I started feeling bad. And then I started thinking  well  of course  we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs  because the security of the Web sort of depends on them. But then I started thinking  is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity  So see  here's the thing. While you're typing a CAPTCHA  during those    seconds  your brain is doing something amazing. Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do. So can we get you to do useful work for those    seconds  Another way of putting it is  is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve  yet we can split into tiny    second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem  And the answer to that is  yes   and this is what we're doing now. So what you may not know is that nowadays while you're typing a CAPTCHA  not only are you authenticating yourself as a human  but in addition you're actually helping us to digitize books. So let me explain how this works. So there's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books. Google has one. The Internet Archive has one. Amazon  now with the Kindle  is trying to digitize books. Basically the way this works is you start with an old book. You've seen those things  right  Like a book  So you start with a book  and then you scan it. Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book. It gives you an image for every page of the book. This is an image with text for every page of the book. The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image. That's using a technology called OCR  for optical character recognition  which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there. Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect. Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow  OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words. For example  for things that were written more than    years ago  the computer cannot recognize about    percent of the words. So what we're doing now is we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we're getting people to read them for us while they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet. So the next time you type a CAPTCHA  these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize. And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because  you see  one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book  it didn't know what it was  and it's going to present it to you. But since it doesn't know the answer for it  it cannot grade it for you. So what we do is we give you another word  one for which the system does know the answer. We don't tell you which one's which  and we say  please type both. And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer  it assumes you are human  and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly. And if we repeat this process to like    different people and all of them agree on what the new word is  then we get one more word digitized accurately. So this is how the system works. And basically  since we released it about three or four years ago  a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books. So for example  Ticketmaster. So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster  you help to digitize a book. Facebook  Every time you add a friend or poke somebody  you help to digitize a book. Twitter and about         other sites are all using reCAPTCHA. And in fact  the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we're digitizing per day is really  really large. It's about     million a day  which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year. And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet. Now of course  since we're doing so many words per day  funny things can happen. And this is especially true because now we're giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other. So funny things can happen. For example  we presented this word. It's the word  Christians   there's nothing wrong with it. But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word  bad things can happen. So we get this.  Text  bad christians  But it's even worse  because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God. Oops. Here's another really bad one. JohnEdwards.com So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday. Now  of course  we're not just insulting people. See here's the thing  since we're presenting two randomly chosen words  interesting things can happen. So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in  which is called CAPTCHA art. I'm sure some of you have heard about it. Here's how it works. Imagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar  like this CAPTCHA.  Text  invisible toaster  Then what you're supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it. Then of course  you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book. But then  first you take a screen shot  and then you draw something that is related to it. That's how it works. There are tens of thousands of these. Some of them are very cute.  Text  clenched it  Some of them are funnier. And some of them  like paleontological shvisle  they contain Snoop Dogg. Okay  so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA. So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project. This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA      million  which is a little over    percent of the world's population  has helped us digitize human knowledge. And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda. So the question that motivates my research is the following  If you look at humanity's large scale achievements  these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically    like for example  building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon    there is a curious fact about them  and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people. It's weird  they were all done with about         people. And the reason for that is because  before the Internet  coordinating more than         people  let alone paying them  was essentially impossible. But now with the Internet  I've just shown you a project where we've gotten     million people to help us digitize human knowledge. So the question that motivates my research is  if we can put a man on the Moon with          what can we do with     million  So based on this question  we've had a lot of different projects that we've been working on. Let me tell you about one that I'm most excited about. This is something that we've been semi quietly working on for the last year and a half or so. It hasn't yet been launched. It's called Duolingo. Since it hasn't been launched  shhhhh  Yeah  I can trust you'll do that. So this is the project. Here's how it started. It started with me posing a question to my graduate student  Severin Hacker. Okay  that's Severin Hacker. So I posed the question to my graduate student. By the way  you did hear me correctly  his last name is Hacker. So I posed this question to him  How can we get     million people translating the Web into every major language for free  Okay  so there's a lot of things to say about this question. First of all  translating the Web. So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages. A large fraction of it is in English. If you don't know any English  you can't access it. But there's large fractions in other different languages  and if you don't know those languages  you can't access it. So I would like to translate all of the Web  or at least most of the Web  into every major language. So that's what I would like to do. Now some of you may say  why can't we use computers to translate  Why can't we use machine translation  Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there. Why can't we use it to translate the whole Web  Well the problem with that is that it's not yet good enough and it probably won't be for the next    to    years. It makes a lot of mistakes. Even when it doesn't make a mistake  since it makes so many mistakes  you don't know whether to trust it or not. So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine. Actually it was a forum post. It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript. It was translated from Japanese into English. So I'll just let you read. This person starts apologizing for the fact that it's translated with a computer. So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question. So he's just explaining something. Remember  it's a question about JavaScript. Then comes the first part of the question. Then comes my favorite part of the question. And then comes the ending  which is my favorite part of the whole thing. Okay  so computer translation  not yet good enough. So back to the question. So we need people to translate the whole Web. So now the next question you may have is  well why can't we just pay people to do this  We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web. We could do that. Unfortunately  it would be extremely expensive. For example  translating a tiny  tiny fraction of the whole Web  Wikipedia  into one other language  Spanish. Wikipedia exists in Spanish  but it's very small compared to the size of English. It's about    percent of the size of English. If we wanted to translate the other    percent into Spanish  it would cost at least    million dollars    and this is at even the most exploited  outsourcing country out there. So it would be very expensive. So what we want to do is we want to get     million people translating the Web into every major language for free. Now if this is what you want to do  you pretty quickly realize you're going to run into two pretty big hurdles  two big obstacles. The first one is a lack of bilinguals. So I don't even know if there exists     million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate. That's a big problem. The other problem you're going to run into is a lack of motivation. How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free  Normally  you have to pay people to do this. So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free  Now when we were starting to think about this  we were blocked by these two things. But then we realized  there's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution. There's a way to kill two birds with one stone. And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do  and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals  and that is language education. So it turns out that today  there are over  .  billion people learning a foreign language. People really  really want to learn a foreign language. And it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school. For example  in the United States alone  there are over five million people who have paid over      for software to learn a new language. So people really  really want to learn a new language. So what we've been working on for the last year and a half is a new website    it's called Duolingo    where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web. And so basically they're learning by doing. So the way this works is whenever you're a just a beginner  we give you very  very simple sentences. There's  of course  a lot of very simple sentences on the Web. We give you very  very simple sentences along with what each word means. And as you translate them  and as you see how other people translate them  you start learning the language. And as you get more and more advanced  we give you more and more complex sentences to translate. But at all times  you're learning by doing. Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works. First of all  people are really  really learning a language. We're mostly done building it  and now we're testing it. People really can learn a language with it. And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software. So people really do learn a language. And not only do they learn it as well  but actually it's way more interesting. Because you see with Duolingo  people are actually learning with real content. As opposed to learning with made up sentences  people are learning with real content  which is inherently interesting. So people really do learn a language. But perhaps more surprisingly  the translations that we get from people using the site  even though they're just beginners  the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators  which is very surprising. So let me show you one example. This is a sentence that was translated from German into English. The top is the German. The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid    cents a word for this translation. And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo  none of whom knew any German before they started using the site. You can see  it's pretty much perfect. Now of course  we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators. We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator. Now even though we're combining the translations  the site actually can translate pretty fast. So let me show you  this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish. Remember  this is    million dollars worth of value. So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish  we could do it in five weeks with         active users. And we could do it in about    hours with a million active users. Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users  we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project. Now the thing that I'm most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education. So here's the thing  The current business model for language education is the student pays  and in particular  the student pays Rosetta Stone     dollars. That's the current business model. The problem with this business model is that    percent of the world's population doesn't have     dollars. So it's extremely unfair towards the poor. This is totally biased towards the rich. Now see  in Duolingo  because while you learn you're actually creating value  you're translating stuff    which for example  we could charge somebody for translations. So this is how we could monetize this. Since people are creating value while they're learning  they don't have to pay their money  they pay with their time. But the magical thing here is that they're paying with their time  but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language. So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model    one that doesn't discriminate against poor people. So here's the site. Thank you. So here's the site. We haven't yet launched  but if you go there  you can sign up to be part of our private beta  which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks. We haven't yet launched this Duolingo. By the way  I'm the one talking here  but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team  some of whom are here. So thank you. I'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them. Spiders are truly global citizens. You can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat. This red dot marks the Great Basin of North America  and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators. Here's one of our field sites  and just to give you a sense of perspective  this little blue smudge here  that's one of my collaborators. This is a rugged and barren landscape  yet there are quite a few spiders here. Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle. Spiders are not just everywhere  but they're extremely diverse. There are over        described species of spiders. To put that number into perspective  here's a graph comparing the        species of spiders to the     species of primates. There are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates. Spiders are also extremely old. On the bottom here  this is the geologic timescale  and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present  so the zero here  that would be today. So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost     million years. To put that into perspective  this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees  a mere seven million years ago. All spiders make silk at some point in their life. Most spiders use copious amounts of silk  and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction. Even fossil spiders can make silk  as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider. So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for     million years. It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life. Spiders use silk for many purposes  including the trailing safety dragline  wrapping eggs for reproduction  protective retreats and catching prey. There are many kinds of spider silk. For example  this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks. When you look at this orb web  you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers. The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk  while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks  the filament and the sticky droplet. How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk  To answer that  you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider. So silk comes out of the spinnerets  and for those of us spider silk biologists  this is what we call the  business end  of the spider.  Laughter  We spend long days ... Hey  Don't laugh. That's my life. We spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider. And this is what we see. You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets  because each spinneret has many spigots on it. Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot  and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider  what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside. So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb web weaving spider  and I hope you do  what you would find is a bounty of beautiful  translucent silk glands. Inside each spider  there are hundreds of silk glands  sometimes thousands. These can be grouped into seven categories. They differ by size  shape  and sometimes even color. In an orb web weaving spider  you can find seven types of silk glands  and what I have depicted here in this picture  let's start at the one o'clock position  there's tubuliform silk glands  which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac. There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web. Pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement    that's the silk that's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate. There's also aciniform silk  which is used to wrap prey. Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction. And the most studied silk line of them all  major ampullate silk. This is the silk that's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web  and also the safety trailing dragline. But what  exactly  is spider silk  Spider silk is almost entirely protein. Nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family  so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family  so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk  and over the last     million years  that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged  specialized  over and over and over again  to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today. There are several features that all these silks have in common. They all have a common design  such as they're all very long    they're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins. They're very repetitive  and they're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine. To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like  this is a dragline silk protein  it's just a portion of it  from the black widow spider. This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night.  Laughter  So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids  and I've colored in the glycines with green  and the alanines in red  and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's. You can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again  so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines  or iterated A's  AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY. You can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words  and these words occur in sentences. So for example this would be one sentence  and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine  that repeats over and over and over again  and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule. Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences. At the top of the screen  you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider. It's short. And on the bottom  this is the repeat sequence for the egg case  or tubuliform silk protein  for the exact same spider. And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are    so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family. You can see that the repeat units differ in length. They also differ in sequence. So I've colored in the glycines again in green  alanine in red  and the serines  the letter S  in purple. And you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red  and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple. What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences  these amino acid sequences  to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers. Now  it's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body. This makes testing spider silk really  really easy to do in the laboratory  because we're actually  you know  testing it in air that's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins. So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing  which is basically  you know  tugging on one end of the fiber  very amenable. Here are stress strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider. So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors. Specifically  if you look on the vertical axis  that's stress. If you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers  you can see that there's a lot of variation  and in fact dragline  or major ampullate silk  is the strongest of these fibers. We think that's because the dragline silk  which is used to make the frame and radii for a web  needs to be very strong. On the other hand  if you were to look at strain    this is how much a fiber can be extended    if you look at the maximum value here  again  there's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform  or the capture spiral filament. In fact  this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length. So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility. In the case of the capture spiral  it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey. If it wasn't able to stretch so much  then basically when an insect hit the web  it would just trampoline right off of it. So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk  an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really  really stretchy capture spiral silk  the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey. There's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make. We call that the tool kit of a spider. That's what the spider has to interact with their environment. But how about variation among spider species  so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders  This is an area that's largely unexplored but here's a little bit of data I can show you. This is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by    species of spiders. Some of them are orb weaving spiders and some of them are non orb weaving spiders. It's been hypothesized that orb weaving spiders  like this argiope here  should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey. What you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph  the higher the toughness. The    species are indicated here by this phylogeny  this evolutionary tree  that shows their genetic relationships  and I've colored in yellow the orb web weaving spiders. If you look right here at the two red arrows  they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus. These are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins. Yet  their draglines are not the toughest. In fact  the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region  a non orb web weaving spider. This is the dragline spun by scytodes  the spitting spider. Scytodes doesn't use a web at all to catch prey. Instead  scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it  and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk like venom onto that insect. Think of hunting with silly string. That's how scytodes forages. We don't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline  but it's unexpected results like this that make bio prospecting so exciting and worthwhile. It frees us from the constraints of our imagination. Now I'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber  bombyx    or domesticated silkworm silk    wool  Kevlar  and carbon fibers. And what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them. It's the combination of strength  extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special  and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists  so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions. And the strength  extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response  have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications  for example  as a component of artificial tendons  for serving as guides to regrow nerves  and for scaffolds for tissue growth. Spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti ballistic capabilities. Silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today. In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks  personally  I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself. I love when I'm in the laboratory  a new spider silk sequence comes in. That's just the best.  Laughter  It's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me  and that's why I'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk. The next time you see a spider web  please  pause and look a little closer. You'll be seeing one of the most high performance materials known to man. To borrow from the writings of a spider named Charlotte  silk is terrific. Thank you.  Applause  Over the last    years    one  three     years    I've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel and partners around the world for taking this idea  this concept  noninvasive surgery  from the research lab to routine clinical use. And this is what I'll tell you about.    years    for some of you  you can empathize with that number. For me  today  on this date  it's like a second bar mitzvah experience. So this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies. One is the focused ultrasound  and the other one is the vision enabled magnetic resonance imaging. So let's first talk about focused ultrasound. And I hold in my hand a tissue mimicking phantom. It is made out of silicon. It is transparent  made just for you. So you see  it's all intact  completely transparent. I'll take you now to the acoustic lab. You see the phantom within the aquarium. This is a setup I put in a physics lab. On the right hand side  you see an ultrasonic transducer. So the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom. Okay  when you hear the click  this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom. Okay  so everything around it is whole and intact. It's just a lesion formed inside. So think about  this is in your brain. We need to reach a target inside the brain. We can do it without harming any tissue. So this is  I think  the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system. Okay  so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound  the force of ultrasound. You know all about imaging  right  ultrasound imaging. And you know also about lithotripsy    breaking kidney stones. But ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between  because it's a mechanical force. Basically  it's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses. So you can change the intensity  the frequency  the duration  the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush to a hammer. And I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing  physically focusing. So this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all. When I was born  this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the Fry brothers and Lars Leksell  who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife. But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain  noninvasively  with focused ultrasound in the '  s. He failed  so he then invented the gammaknife. And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed. And there was something fundamental that they were missing. They were missing the vision. It wasn't until the invention of the MR and really the integration of MR with focused ultrasound that we could get the feedback    both the anatomical and the physiological in order to have a completely noninvasive  closed loop surgical procedure. So this is how it looks  you know  the operating room of the future today. This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system. And I will give you several examples. So the first one is in the brain. One of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders  like Parkinson's or essential tremor. What is typical to those conditions  to essential tremor for example  is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything all over you  or write legibly so people can understand it  and be really independent in your life without the help of others. So I'd like you to meet John. John is a retired professor of history from Virginia. So he suffered from essential tremor for many years. And medication didn't help him anymore. And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain. And about four or five months ago  he underwent an experimental procedure. It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus. And this is his handwriting.  On June   th   if you can read it       .  This is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the MR So now I'll take you through  what  a typical procedure like that looks like   what  noninvasive surgery looks like. So we put the patient on the MR table. We attach a transducer  in this case  to the brain  but if it will be a different organ  it will be a different transducer attached to the patient. And the physician will then take a regular MR scan. And the objective of that  I don't have a pointer here  but you see the green  sort of rectangle or trapezoid  This is the sort of general area of the treatment. It's a safety boundary around the target. It's a target in the thalamus. So once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on  he selects basically a point    you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is    and he presses this blue button called  sonicate.  We call this instance of injecting the energy  we call it sonication. The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse. This is the only device he needs in this treatment. So he presses  sonicate   and this is what happens. You see the transducer  the light blue. There's water in between the skull and the transducer. And it does this burst of energy. It elevates the temperature. We first need to verify that we are on target. So the first sonication is at lower energy. It doesn't do any damage  but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees. And one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the MR is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively. This is really a unique capability of the MR. It is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging. But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time. And you can see the points there on the graph. The temperature was raised to    degrees C temporarily. This doesn't cause any damage. But the point is we are right on target. So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen  then we move to perform a full energy ablation like you see here. And you see the temperature rises to like    to    degrees C. If you do it for more than a second  it's enough to basically destroy the proteins of the cells. This is the outcome from a patient perspective    same day after the treatment. This is an immediate relief. Thank you. John is one of  about  a dozen very heroic  courageous people who volunteered for the study. And you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk. And this is a quote from John after he wrote it. He said   Miraculous.  And his wife said   This is the happiest moment of my life.  And you wonder why. I mean  one of the messages I like to carry over is  what about defending quality of life  I mean  those people lose their independence. They are dependent on others. And John today is fully independent. He returned to a normal life routine. And he also plays golf  like you do in Virginia when you are retired. Okay  so you can see here the spot. It's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain. There's no damage outside. He suffers from no neurodeficit. There's no recovery needed  no nothing. He's back to his normal life. Let's move now to a more painful subject. Pain is something that can make your life miserable. And people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain  lower back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases  when the metastases get to your bones  sometimes they are very painful. All those I've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain  again  very fast. And I would like to tell you about PJ. He's a    year old farmer who suffered from    how should I say it     it's called pain in the butt. He had metastases in his right buttock  and he couldn't sit even with medication. He had to forgo all the farm activities. He was treated with radiation therapy  state of the art radiation therapy  but it didn't help. Many patients like that favor radiation therapy. And again  he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide  also in the U.S. And his wife actually took him. They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital. He had to sit on a cushion  stand still  not move  because it was very painful. He took the treatment  and on the way back  he drove the truck by himself. So again  this is an immediate relief. And you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens. He returned again to his daily routine on the farm. He rides his tractor. He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly. And he has been very happy. But now  you ask me  but what about war  the war on cancer  Show us some primary cancer. What can be done there  So I have good news and bad news. The good news  there's a lot that can be done. And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S. And doing that in the U.S. is very painful. I don't see  without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen  it will not happen. And it's not just because of regulation  it's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen. So the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer. They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound. And we have better than surgery results in breasts. But I have a message for the men here. We heard here yesterday Quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer. There is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by MR  because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy    treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland  and by that  avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence. Well  there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen    quite lethal  very lethal actually    pancreas  liver  kidney. The challenge there with a breathing and awake patient    and in all our treatments  the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician    is you have to teach the MR some tricks how to do it in real time. And this will take time. This will take two years. But I have now a message to the ladies. And this is  in       the FDA has approved MR guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. Women suffer from that disease. All those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods  abdominal pressure  back pain  frequent urination. And sometimes  they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid. This is Frances. She was diagnosed with a grapefruit sized fibroid. This is a big fibroid. She was offered a hysterectomy  but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option. So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in     . And in       she became a first time mother to a healthy baby. So new life was born. So in conclusion  I'd like to leave you with actually four messages. One is  think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery  and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large    and I think also from their physicians  by the way. And the other thing I would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table  who  is awake and can even monitor the treatment. In all our treatments  the patient holds a stop sonication button. He can stop the surgery at any moment. And with that note  I would like to thank you for listening. Okay  I have no idea what we're going to play. I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens. I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before. So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard. Okay  so first of all  let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums  Burniss Travis on the bass  and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano. So the bandstand  as we call it  this is an incredible space. It is really a sacred space. And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future  or the past. You really are alive right here in this moment. There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand. We had no idea what key we were going to play in. In the middle  we sort of made our way into a song called  Titi Boom.  But that could have happened    maybe  maybe not. Everyone's listening. We're responding. You have no time for projected ideas. So the idea of a mistake  From the perspective of a jazz musician  it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake. So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand    first of all  we don't really see it as a mistake. The only mistake lies in that I'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did. Every  mistake  is an opportunity in jazz. So it's hard to even describe what a funny note would be. So for example  if I played a color  like we were playing on a palette  that sounded like this ... So if Christian played a note    like play an F. See  these are all right inside of the color palette. If you played an E. See  these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting. If you played an F  though  to most people's ears  they would perceive that as a mistake. So I'm going to show you  we're going to play just for a second. And we're going to play on this palette. And at some point  Christian will introduce this note. And we won't react to it. He'll introduce it for a second and then I'll stop  I'll talk for a second. We'll see what happens when we play with this palette. So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake. The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it. It was an opportunity that was missed. So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again. He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it  but something will change. We'll all accept his ideas  or not. So you see  he played this note. I ended up creating a melody out of it. The texture changed in the drums this time. It got a little bit more rhythmic  a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it. So there is no mistake. The only mistake is if I'm not aware  if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity. So jazz  this bandstand is absolutely amazing. It's a very purifying experience. And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted. We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing. So how does this all relate to behavioral finance  Well we're jazz musicians  so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance. Anyway  I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it. And the other dynamic of it is that we don't micromanage in jazz. You have some people who do. But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities. If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way  and I just jump right in ... ready  just play some time. One  two  one  two  three  four. It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas. I'm telling them   You come with me over this way.  If I really want the music to go there  the best way for me to do it is to listen. This is a science of listening. It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do. So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity  the first step for me is to be patient  to listen to what's going on and pull from something that's going on around me. When you do that  you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more  and gradually it builds. Watch. One  two  a one  two  three  four. Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas. It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced. It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that. It's about being here in the moment  accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow. Thank you. My travels to Afghanistan began many  many years ago on the eastern border of my country  my homeland  Poland. I was walking through the forests of my grandmother's tales. A land where every field hides a grave  where millions of people have been deported or killed in the   th century. Behind the destruction  I found a soul of places. I met humble people. I heard their prayer and ate their bread. Then I have been walking East for    years    from Eastern Europe to Central Asia    through the Caucasus Mountains  Middle East  North Africa  Russia. And I ever met more humble people. And I shared their bread and their prayer. This is why I went to Afghanistan. One day  I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River. I was alone on foot. And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport. But he gave me a cup of tea. And I understood that his surprise was my protection. So I have been walking and traveling  by horses  by yak  by truck  by hitchhiking  from Iran's border to the bottom  to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor. And in this way I could find noor  the hidden light of Afghanistan. My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica. I heard prayers of the Sufi    humble Muslims  hated by the Taliban. Hidden river  interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India. The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears  and welcomed as a gift. What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect  about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium  These are opium addicted people on the roofs of Kabul    years after the beginning of our war. These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen. What do we know about the women    years after the war  Clothed in this nylon bag  made in China  with the name of burqa. I saw one day  the largest school in Afghanistan  a girls' school.        girls studying here in the rooms underground  full of scorpions. And their love  for studying  was so big that I cried. What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh  The region is not secure  but full of the Taliban  and they did it. My aim is to give a voice to the silent people  to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game  the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict. Thanks. I want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine  and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved. Our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single  solo inventor who  working late in the lab one night  makes an earthshaking discovery  and voila  overnight everything's changed. That's a very appealing picture  however  it's just not true. In fact  medicine today is a team sport. And in many ways  it always has been. I'd like to share with you a story about how I've experienced this very dramatically in my own work. I'm a surgeon  and we surgeons have always had this special relationship with light. When I make an incision inside a patient's body  it's dark. We need to shine light to see what we're doing. And this is why  traditionally  surgeries have always started so early in the morning    to take advantage of daylight hours. And if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms  they have been on top of buildings. For example  this is the oldest operating room in the Western world  in London  where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in. And then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in America. This is Mass General in Boston. And do you know where the operating room is  Here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in. So nowadays in the operating room  we no longer need to use sunlight. And because we no longer need to use sunlight  we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room. We have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights    lights that can allow us to see what we currently don't see. And this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence. So let me back up a little bit. When we are in medical school  we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything's color coded. Nerves are yellow  arteries are red  veins are blue. That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon  right  However  when we have a real patient on the table  this is the same neck dissection    not so easy to tell the difference between different structures. We heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society  what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute. Well if cancer can be caught early  enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out  excised with surgery  I don't care if it has this gene or that gene  or if it has this protein or that protein  it's in the jar. It's done  it's out  you're cured of cancer. This is how we excise cancers. We do our best  based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience  we say  you know what  the cancer's gone. We've made a good job. We've taken it out. That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table. But then we actually don't know that it's all out. We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed  what's left behind in the patient  and then send those bits to the pathology lab. In the meanwhile  the patient's on the operating room table. The nurses  anesthesiologist  the surgeon  all the assistants are waiting around. And we wait. The pathologist takes that sample  freezes it  cuts it  looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room. And that may be    minutes later per piece. So if you've sent three specimens  it's an hour later. And very often they say   You know what  points A and B are okay  but point C  you still have some residual cancer there. Please go cut that piece out.  So we go back and we do that again  and again. And this whole process   Okay you're done. We think the entire tumor is out.  But very often several days later  the patient's gone home  we get a phone call   I'm sorry  once we looked at the final pathology  once we looked at the final specimen  we actually found that there's a couple other spots where the margins are positive. There's still cancer in your patient.  So now you're faced with telling your patient  first of all  that they may need another surgery  or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy. So wouldn't it be better if we could really tell  if the surgeon could really tell  whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field  I mean  in many ways  the way that we're doing it  we're still operating in the dark. So in       during my surgical residency  I had the great fortune to meet Dr. Roger Tsien  who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry in     . Roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer  and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with. The molecule they had developed had three parts. The main part of it is the blue part  polycation  and it's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body. So imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer  everything's going to get lit up. Nothing will be specific. There's no specificity there. So they added two additional components. The first one is a polyanionic segment  which basically acts as a non stick backing like the back of a sticker. So when those two are together  the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down. And the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors    for example  the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make. So here in this situation  if you make a solution full of this three part molecule along with the dye  which is shown in green  and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer  normal tissue can't cut it. The molecule passes through and gets excreted. However  in the presence of the tumor  now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site. And now  boom  the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent. So here's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it. Can you tell where the tumor is  I couldn't when I was working on this. But here it is. It's fluorescent. Now it's green. See  so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is. We can tell in the operating room  in the field  at a molecular level  where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out. And the cool thing about fluorescence is that it's not only bright  it actually can shine through tissue. The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue. So even if the tumor is not right on the surface  you'll still be able to see it. In this movie  you can see that the tumor is green. There's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that  And I'm peeling that muscle away. But even before I peel that muscle away  you saw that there was a tumor underneath. So that's the beauty of having a tumor that's labeled with fluorescent molecules. That you can  not only see the margins right there on a molecular level  but you can see it even if it's not right on the top    even if it's beyond your field of view. And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also. Sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer  melanoma. Women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes. But when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment protocol  the surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer. And then if that node has cancer  the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection. So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer  the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery. But sentinel lymph node  the way that we do it today  is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go. So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station  you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road. It doesn't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas. You have to cut it out  bring it back home  cut it up  look inside and say   Oh yes  it does have gas.  So that takes more time. Patients are still on the operating room table. Anesthesiologists  surgeons are waiting around. That takes time. So with our technology  we can tell right away. You see a lot of little  roundish bumps there. Some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others. Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold  That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside. Well with our technology  the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer. I won't go into this very much  but our technology  besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence  we can also use the same smart three part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively. The patient has cancer  you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before you go in. Well you can see this on an MRI. So in surgery  it's important to know what to cut out. But equally important is to preserve things that are important for function. So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury. And what I'm talking about are nerves. Nerves  if they are injured  can cause paralysis  can cause pain. In the setting of prostate cancer  up to    percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction. That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems    and this is even in so called nerve sparing surgery  which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem  and they are trying to avoid the nerves. But you know what  these little nerves are so small  in the context of prostate cancer  that they are actually never seen. They are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature. And they're known because somebody has decided to study them  which means that we're still learning about where they are. Crazy to think that we're having surgery  we're trying to excise cancer  we don't know where the cancer is. We're trying to preserve nerves  we can't see where they are. So I said  wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence  And at first this didn't get a lot of support. People said   We've been doing it this way for all these years. What's the problem  We haven't had that many complications.  But I went ahead anyway. And Roger helped me. And he brought his whole team with him. So there's that teamwork thing again. And we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves. And when we made a solution of this  tagged with the fluorescence and injected in the body of a mouse  their nerves literally glowed. You can see where they are. Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse  and you can see that that big  fat portion you can see very easily. But in fact  at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now  there's actually very fine arborizations that can't really be seen. You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out. We have been able to see nerves for facial expression  for facial movement  for breathing    every single nerve    nerves for urinary function around the prostate. We've been able to see every single nerve. When we put these two probes together ... So here's a tumor. Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is  Now you do. What about the nerve that's going into this tumor  That white portion there is easy to see. But what about the part that goes into the tumor  Do you know where it's going  Now you do. Basically  we've come up with a way to stain tissue and color code the surgical field. This was a bit of a breakthrough. I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery. We published our results in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and in Nature Biotechnology. We received commentary in Discover magazine  in The Economist. And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues. They said   Wow  I have patients who would benefit from this. I think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications.  What needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room. The eventual goal is that we'll get this into patients. However  we've discovered that there's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one time use. Understandably  the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple use drugs  such as long term daily medications. We are focused on making this technology better. We're focused on adding drugs  adding growth factors  killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue. We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it. I'd like to leave you with this final thought. Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough. It is not a sprint. It is not an event for the solo runner. Successful innovation is a team sport  it's a relay race. It requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted. And this takes the long term steady courage of the day in day out struggle to educate  to persuade and to win acceptance. And that is the light that I want to shine on health and medicine today. Thank you very much. I'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature. The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet  so those invoices don't get issued. But we need to do something about this problem. I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest  but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature  and which doesn't get priced by the markets. A project called TEEB was started in       and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G   . And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern. They asked themselves a question  If economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change  well why can't the same be done for conservation  Why can't an equivalent case be made for nature  And the answer is  Yeah  it can. But it's not that straightforward. Biodiversity  the living fabric of this planet  is not a gas. It exists in many layers  ecosystems  species and genes across many scales    international  national  local  community    and doing for nature what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy. And yet  we began. We began the project with an interim report  which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many  many researchers. And amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that  in fact  we were losing natural capital    the benefits that flow from nature to us. We were losing it at an extraordinary rate    in fact  of the order of two to four trillion dollars worth of natural capital. This came out in       which was  of course  around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars. So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss. We then have gone on since to present for  the  international community  for governments  for local governments and for business and for people  for you and me  a whole slew of reports  which were presented at the U.N. last year  which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it. What is this about  A picture that you're familiar with    the Amazon rainforests. It's a massive store of carbon  it's an amazing store of biodiversity  but what people don't really know is this also is a rain factory. Because the northeastern trade winds  as they go over the Amazonas  effectively gather the water vapor. Something like    billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds  and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin. This rainfall cycle  this rainfall factory  effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of     billion dollars worth in Latin America. But the question arises  Okay  so how much do Uruguay  Paraguay  Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas  which produces that rainfall  And the answer is zilch  exactly zero. That's the economic invisibility of nature. That can't keep going on  because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful. Economics has become the currency of policy. And unless we address this invisibility  we are going to get the results that we are seeing  which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset. It's not just about the Amazonas  or indeed about rainforests. No matter what level you look at  whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level  we see the same problem again and again. So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level. At the species level  it's been estimated that insect based pollination  bees pollinating fruit and so on  is something like     billion dollars worth. That's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally. It completely passes below the radar screen. But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice  Or for that matter  if you look at the genetic level     percent of medicines were prospected  were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef. Once again  most of that doesn't get paid. And that brings me to another aspect of this  which is  to whom should this get paid  That genetic material probably belonged  if it could belong to anyone  to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule  which then became the medicine. They were the ones that didn't get paid. And if you look at the species level  you saw about fish. Today  the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor  the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods  to feed their families. Something like a billion people depend on fish  the quantity of fish in the oceans. A billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein. And at this rate at which we are losing fish  it is a human problem of enormous dimensions  a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before. And finally  at the ecosystem level  whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests  or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats  or whether it's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest  it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services. We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil  India and Indonesia  even though ecosystem services    these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free    they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP    two  four  eight         percent    but in these countries  if we measure how much they're worth to the poor  the answers are more like    percent     percent     percent. That's the difference. Because these are important benefits for the poor. And you can't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset  the most important asset  which is your development asset  that is ecological infrastructure. How bad can things get  Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance. It's basically a measure of how many tigers  toads  ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around. The green represents the percentage. If you start green  it's like    to     percent. If it's yellow  it's    to    percent. And these are percentages versus the original state  so to speak  the pre industrial era      . Now I'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this. And just watch the change in colors in India  China  Europe  sub Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us. See that again. The only places that remain green    and that's not good news    is  in fact  places like the Gobi Desert  like the tundra and like the Sahara. But that doesn't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place. This is the challenge. The reason this is happening boils down  in my mind  to one basic problem  which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits. We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth  it's common goods. And here's an example from Thailand where we found that  because the value of a mangrove is not that much    it's about      over the life of nine years that this has been measured    compared to its value as a shrimp farm  which is more like         there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms. But of course  if you look at exactly what those profits are  almost       of those dollars are  in fact  subsidies. So you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it's more like       to    . That's not that hard. But on the other hand  if you start measuring  how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use  Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects  that answer is more like         of cost. And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries  the fish nurseries  that provide fish for the poor  that answer is more like        . So now look at the different lens. If you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits  you get a completely different answer  which is clearly conservation makes more sense  and not destruction. So is this just a story from South Thailand  Sorry  this is a global story. And here's what the same calculation looks like  which was done recently    well I say recently  over the last    years    by a group called TRUCOST. And they calculated for the top       corporations  what are the externalities  In other words  what are the costs of doing business as usual  This is not illegal stuff  this is basically business as usual  which causes climate changing emissions  which have an economic cost. It causes pollutants being issued  which have an economic cost  health cost and so on. Use of freshwater. If you drill water to make coke near a village farm  that's not illegal  but yes  it costs the community. Can we stop this  and how  I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital. Basically the stuff of life is natural capital  and we need to recognize and build that into our systems. When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level  we don't include our biggest asset at the country level. When we measure corporate performances  we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society. That has to stop. In fact  this was what really inspired my interest in this phase. I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project. That was in the early     s when India was going gung ho about GDP growth as the means forward    looking at China with its stellar growths of eight  nine     percent and wondering  why can we do the same  And a few friends of mine and I decided this doesn't make sense. This is going to create more cost to society and more losses. So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states. That's how my interests began and went to the TEEB project. Calculating this at the national level is one thing  and it has begun. And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they've started a project called WAVES    Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services. But calculating this at the next level  that means at the business sector level  is important. And actually we've done this with the TEEB project. We've done this for a very difficult case  which was for deforestation in China. This is important  because in China in       the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society. Just a year later the Yangtze flooded  causing something like       deaths. So clearly there was a problem with deforestation. It was associated largely with the construction industry. And the Chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling. A retrospective on    years shows that if we had accounted for these costs    the cost of loss of topsoil  the cost of loss of waterways  the lost productivity  the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors  desertification and so on    those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber. So in fact  the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace ought to have been three times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within China. Of course  after the event one can be wise. The way to do this is to do it on a company basis  to take leadership forward  and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost  and to disclose these answers. Someone once asked me   Who is better or worse  is it Unilever or is it P G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia   And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies  good though they are and professional though they are  do not calculate or disclose their externalities. But if we look at companies like PUMA    Jochen Zeitz  their CEO and chairman  once challenged me at a function  saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it. Well I think we kind of did it at the same time  but he's done it. He's basically worked the cost to PUMA. PUMA has  .  billion dollars of turnover      million dollars of profits      million dollars after tax     million dollars of externalities  cost to business. Now that's not a happy situation for them  but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say   Here's what we are measuring. We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure.  That's an example  I think  for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from. If more companies did this  and if more sectors engaged this as sectors  you could have analysts  business analysts  and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies. Today we can't yet do that  but I think the path is laid out. This can be done. And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K. has already set up a coalition to do this  an international coalition. The other favorite  if you like  solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets. And by the way  these are my favorites    externalities calculation and green carbon markets. TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco certification and you name it  but these are the favorites. What's green carbon  Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace. It's about energy emissions. The European Union ETS is the main marketplace. It's not doing too well. We've over issued. A bit like inflation  you over issue currency  you get what you see  declining prices. But that's all about energy and industry. But what we're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon  that is soot. What we're also missing is blue carbon  which  by the way  is the largest store of carbon    more than    percent. Thankfully  the flux  in other words  the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa  is more or less balanced. In fact  what's being absorbed is something like    percent of our emissions  which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans. More of that in a minute. And finally  there's deforestation  and there's emission of methane from agriculture. Green carbon  which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions  and blue carbon together comprise    percent of our emissions. We have the means already in our hands  through a structure  through a mechanism  called REDD Plus    a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme. So we actually have some movement forward. But the thing is to do a lot more of that. Will this solve the problem  Will economics solve everything  Well I'm afraid not. There is an area that is the oceans  coral reefs. As you can see  they cut across the entire globe all the way from Micronesia across Indonesia  Malaysia  India  Madagascar and to the West of the Caribbean. These red dots  these red areas  basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people. So that's almost an eighth of society. And the sad thing is that  as these coral reefs are lost    and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above     parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs    we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species  the warm water corals  we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans  but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than     million people who live in the developing world in poor countries. So in selecting targets of     parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations  what we have done is we've made an ethical choice. We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs. Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that. Let's think about it and what it means  but please  let's not do more of that. Because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital. I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices. Thank you. Ben Roche  So I'm Ben  by the way. Homaro Cantu  And I'm Homaro. BR  And we're chefs. So when Moto opened in       people didn't really know what to expect. A lot of people thought that it was a Japanese restaurant  and maybe it was the name  maybe it was the logo  which was like a Japanese character  but anyway  we had all these requests for Japanese food  which is really not what we did. And after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll  we decided to give the people what they wanted. So this picture is an example of printed food  and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation. So this is all the ingredients  all the flavor of  you know  a standard maki roll  printed onto a little piece of paper. HC  So our diners started to get bored with this idea  and we decided to give them the same course twice  so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish. So this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood. The champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of seafood and some cr me fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish.  Laughter  BR  But it's not all just edible pictures. We decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar    so in this case  we have carrot cake. So we take a carrot cake  put it in a blender  and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice  and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream  I guess  and it comes off looking like  you know  Jupiter's floating around your plate. So yeah  we're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for. HC  And here's something we have no reference to eat. This is a cigar  and basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of a Cuban pork sandwich  so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder  we fashion that into ash. We take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green  put an edible label that bears no similarity to a Cohiba cigar label  and we put it in a dollar ninety nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it.  Laughter  HC  Delicious. BR  That's not it  though. Instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn't eat  we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know. So this is a plate of nachos. The difference between our nachos and the other guy's nachos  is that this is actually a dessert. So the chips are candied  the ground beef is made from chocolate  and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese. And after doing all of this dematerialization and reconfiguring of this  of these ingredients  we realized that it was pretty cool  because as we served it  we learned that the dish actually behaves like the real thing  where the cheese begins to melt. So when you're looking at this thing in the dining room  you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos  and it's not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert  and it's just kind of like a mind ripper. HC  So we had been creating all of these dishes out of a kitchen that was more like a mechanic's shop than a kitchen  and the next logical step for us was to install a state of the art laboratory  and that's what we have here. So we put this in the basement  and we got really serious about food  like serious experimentation. BR  One of the really cool things about the lab  besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen  is that  you know  with this new equipment  and this new approach  all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open  and so the experiments and the food and the dishes that we created  they just kept going further and further out there. HC  Let's talk about flavor transformation  and let's actually make some cool stuff. You see a cow with its tongue hanging out. What I see is a cow about to eat something delicious. What is that cow eating  And why is it delicious  So the cow  basically  eats three basic things in their feed  corn  beets  and barley  and so what I do is I actually challenge my staff with these crazy  wild ideas. Can we take what the cow eats  remove the cow  and then make some hamburgers out of that  And basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this.  Laughter  BR  Yeah  that's our chef de cuisine  Chris Jones. This is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task  but a lot of these ideas  they're hard to understand. They're hard to just get automatically. There's a lot of research and a lot of failure  trial and error    I guess  more error    that goes into each and every dish  so we don't always get it right  and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people. HC  So  after about a day of Chris and I staring at each other  we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty  and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat. This is made from three ingredients  beets  barley  corn  and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat  looks and tastes like hamburger meat  and not only that  but it's basically removing the cow from the equation. So replicating food  taking it into that next level is where we're going. BR  And it's definitely the world's first bleeding veggie burger  which is a cool side effect. And a miracle berry  if you're not familiar with it  is a natural ingredient  and it contains a special property. It's a glycoprotein called miraculin  a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks me out every time I eat it  but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue  so that primarily sour taste receptors  so normally things that would taste very sour or tart  somehow begin to taste very sweet. HC  You're about to eat a lemon  and now it tastes like lemonade. Let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that. We could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas  and we can replace it with all natural fresh fruit. BR  So you see us here cutting up some watermelon. The idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles  wasted energy  and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna  or any exotic produce or item from a very far away place  with local  organic produce  so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin. HC  So if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things  we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon  and it makes it go from sweet to savory. So after we do that  we put it into a vacuum bag  add a little bit of seaweed  some spices  and we roll it  and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna. So the key now is to make it behave like tuna. BR  And then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear  we really have something that looks  tastes and behaves like the real thing. HC  So the key thing to remember here is  we don't really care what this tuna really is. As long as it's good for you and good for the environment  it doesn't matter. But where is this going  How can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology  So here's the next challenge. I told the staff  let's just take a bunch of wild plants  think of them as food ingredients. As long as they're non poisonous to the human body  go out around Chicago sidewalks  take it  blend it  cook it and then have everybody flavor trip on it at Moto. Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think.  Laughter  BR  Yeah  so you can imagine  a task like this    this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for. But we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general  because these are ingredients  you know  plant life that we're  one  unfamiliar with  and two  we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don't eat them. So we really had to think about new  creative ways to flavor  new ways to cook and to change texture    and that was the main issue with this challenge. HC  So this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead. So developing nations and first world nations  imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them  food miles would basically turn into food feet. This disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are  even if we just swapped out  say  one of these for flour  that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste. And to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers  there's a bale of hay there and some crab apples. And basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients. People swore they were eating barbecue sauce  and this is free food. BR  Thanks  guys. I'm actually going to share something with you I haven't talked about probably in more than    years. So bear with me as I take you through this journey. When I was    years old  I came home from work  put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run. I had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever. While I was preparing my dog for the run  a man was finishing drinking at a bar  picked up his car keys  got into a car and headed south  or wherever he was. I was running across the street  and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head. And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth. What had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog. She ended up underneath the car. I flew out in front of the car  and then he ran over my legs. My left leg got caught up in the wheel well    spun it around. The bumper of the car hit my throat  slicing it open. I ended up with blunt chest trauma. Your aorta comes up behind your heart. It's your major artery  and it was severed  so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth. It foamed  and horrible things were happening to me. I had no idea what was going on  but strangers intervened  kept my heart moving  beating. I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it. Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there. And my lung collapsed  so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well to stop that catastrophic event from happening. Somehow I ended up at the hospital. I was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug induced coma.    months later I woke up. I was blind  I couldn't speak  and I couldn't walk. I was    lbs. The hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that. And in fact  they started to call me a Gomer. That's another story we won't even get into. I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together  to repair my heart a few times. Some things worked  some things didn't. I had lots of titanium put in me  cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way. And I ended up with a plastic nose  porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things. But eventually I started to look human again. But it's hard sometimes to talk about these things  so bear with me. I had more than    surgeries. But who's counting  So eventually  the hospital decided it was time for me to go. They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through. Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover. So they basically put a map up on the wall  threw a dart  and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado. And I know all of you are scratching your head   A senior citizens' home  What in the world are you going to do there   But if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now  that's what a senior home has. So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had. The one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom  because they had a long life. And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life. But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep  At that point  I had gained four pounds  so I was    lbs. I was bald. I was wearing hospital scrubs. And somebody donated tennis shoes for me. And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand. And so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting. So they pulled back and they were looking at each other  and they were going   Okay  what skills do we have in this room  This kid needs a lot of work.  So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs. But one of the first things they needed to do was assess what I needed right away. I needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being  since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins. So I had to go through trying to eat again. And they went through that process. And then they had to figure out   Well she needs furniture. She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment.  So they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture    gave me pots and pans  blankets  everything. And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover. So out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints. We're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me once my hair grew back. But I did say no to the blue hair. So eventually what went on is they decided that  well I need to learn to speak. So you can't be an independent person if you're not able to speak and can't see. So they figured not being able to see is one thing  but they need to get me to talk. So while Sally  the office manager  was teaching me to speak in the day    it's hard  because when you're a kid  you take things for granted. You learn things unconsciously. But for me  I was an adult and it was embarrassing  and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips  and capture the air and get the word out. So I acted like a two year old and refused to work. But the men had a better idea. They were going to make it fun for me. So they were teaching me cuss word Scrabble at night  and then  secretly  how to swear like a sailor. So I'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were when Sally finally got my confidence built. So I moved on from there. And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's took on the task of teaching me to write. The redundancy was actually good for me. So we'll just keep moving on. One of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person. So close your eyes. Now imagine you have to cross a street. You don't know how far that street is and you don't know if you're going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth  and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation. So there were two obstacles I had to get through. One was post traumatic stress disorder. And every time I approached the corner or the curb I would panic. And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street. So one of the seniors just came up to me  and she pushed me up to the corner and she said   When you think it's time to go  just stick the cane out there. If it's hit  don't cross the street.  Made perfect sense. But by the third cane that went whizzing across the road  they realized that they needed to put the resources together  and they raised funds so that I could go to the Braille Institute and actually gain the skills to be a blind person  and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life. And I was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me  and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.    years later I gained my sight back. Not magically. I opted in for three surgeries  and one of them was experimental. It was actually robotic surgery. They removed a hematoma from behind my eye. The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward  that there were innovations and all kinds of new things    cellphones  laptops  all these things that I had never seen before. And as a blind person  your visual memory fades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell. So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster. So I was walking around it. And I go   I'm just going to touch it.  And I touched it and I went   Oh my God  it's a laundry basket.  So everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted. But when you're blind  you have the tactile memory for things. The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that I'd lost    years of my life. I thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends. But when I looked down  I realized that time marched on for me too and that I needed to get caught up  so I got going on it. We didn't have words like crowd sourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident. But the concept held true    people working with people to rebuild me  people working with people to re educate me. I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration. Thank you so much. I'm here to talk about the wonder and the mystery of conscious minds. The wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind. We recovered minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence  yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder. We should  in fact  because without having this possibility of conscious minds  we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity  we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world. We would have no pains  but also no joys. We would have no access to love or to the ability to create. And of course  Scott Fitzgerald said famously that  he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for.  But he also forgot that without consciousness  he would have no access to true happiness and even the possibility of transcendence. So much for the wonder  now for the mystery. This is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate. All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience  this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation  has got major controversies. And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it  we should just leave it alone  it's not to be solved. I don't believe that  and I think the situation is changing. It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains  but we certainly can begin to approach the question  and we can begin to see the shape of a solution. And one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do  for example  what you're seeing right now. These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab  and which show you  in a living brain  the reconstruction of that brain. And this is a person who is alive. This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy. And even more    and this is something that one can be really amazed about    is what I'm going to show you next  which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections  real pathways. So all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons  the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses. And I'm sorry to disappoint you  they don't come in color. But at any rate  they are there. The colors are codes for the direction  from whether it is back to front or vice versa. At any rate  what is consciousness  What is a conscious mind  And we could take a very simple view and say  well  it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams  or when we go under anesthesia  and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia. But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia  or when we are in deep  dreamless sleep  Well first of all  it is a mind  which is a flow of mental images. And of course consider images that can be sensory patterns  visual  such as you're having right now in relation to the stage and me  or auditory images  as you are having now in relation to my words. That flow of mental images is mind. But there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room. We are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images. We have selves. We have a Me that is automatically present in our minds right now. We own our minds. And we have a sense that it's everyone of us that is experiencing this    not the person who is sitting next to you. So in order to have a conscious mind  you have a self within the conscious mind. So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it. The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind  and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind. So what we need to know to even address this mystery is  number one  how are minds are put together in the brain  and  number two  how selves are constructed. Now the first part  the first problem  is relatively easy    it's not easy at all    but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience. And it's quite clear that  in order to make minds  we need to construct neural maps. So imagine a grid  like the one I'm showing you right now  and now imagine  within that grid  that two dimensional sheet  imagine neurons. And picture  if you will  a billboard  a digital billboard  where you have elements that can be either lit or not. And depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting  the digital elements  or  for that matter  the neurons in the sheet  you're going to be able to construct a map. This  of course  is a visual map that I'm showing you  but this applies to any kind of map    auditory  for example  in relation to sound frequencies  or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate. Now to bring home the point of how close it is    the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience    I'm going to tell you a personal story. So if I cover my left eye    I'm talking about me personally  not all of you    if I cover my left eye  I look at the grid    pretty much like the one I'm showing you. Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular. But sometime ago  I discovered that if I cover my left eye  instead what I get is this. I look at the grid and I see a warping at the edge of my central left field. Very odd    I've analyzed this for a while. But sometime ago  through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine  Carmen Puliafito  who developed a laser scanner of the retina  I found out the the following. If I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner  what I get is the following. On the right side  my retina is perfectly symmetrical. You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins. But on my left retina there is a bump  which is marked there by the red arrow. And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below. And that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image. So just think of this  you have a grid of neurons  and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid  and you get a warping of your mental experience. So this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina  which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball  or  for that matter  a sheet of visual cortex. So from the retina you go onto visual cortex. And of course  the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina. And in that image there  you see a variety of islands of what I call image making regions in the brain. You have the green for example  that corresponds to tactile information  or the blue that corresponds to auditory information. And something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps  can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around  which is the association cortex  where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making. And the great beauty is that you can then go from memory  out of those association cortices  and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception. So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is. So it provides certain areas for perception and image making. And those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information. So far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images. But what about the self  The self is really the elusive problem. And for a long time  people did not even want to touch it  because they'd say   How can you have this reference point  this stability  that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day   And I thought about a solution to this problem. It's the following. We generate brain maps of the body's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps. So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this. I came to this because  if you're going to have a reference that we know as self    the Me  the I in our own processing    we need to have something that is stable  something that does not deviate much from day to day. Well it so happens that we have a singular body. We have one body  not two  not three. And so that is a beginning. There is just one reference point  which is the body. But then  of course  the body has many parts  and things grow at different rates  and they have different sizes and different people  however  not so with the interior. The things that have to do with what is known as our internal milieu    for example  the whole management of the chemistries within our body are  in fact  extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason. If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life permitting survival range  you go into disease or death. So we have an in built system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity. I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day. Because if you don't have that sameness  physiologically  you're going to be sick or you're going to die. So that's one more element for this continuity. And the final thing is that there is a very tight coupling between the regulation of our body within the brain and the body itself  unlike any other coupling. So for example  I'm making images of you  but there's no physiological bond between the images I have of you as an audience and my brain. However  there is a close  permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own body. So here's how it looks. Look at the region there. There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord. And it is within that region that I'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life regulation devices of the body. This is so specific that  for example  if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem  if you damage that as a result of a stroke  for example  what you get is coma or vegetative state  which is a state  of course  in which your mind disappears  your consciousness disappears. What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self  you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence  and  in fact  there can be images going on  being formed in the cerebral cortex  except you don't know they're there. You have  in effect  lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem. But if you consider the green part of the brain stem  nothing like that happens. It is that specific. So in that green component of the brain stem  if you damage it  and often it happens  what you get is complete paralysis  but your conscious mind is maintained. You feel  you know  you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly. This is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it. And people are  in fact  imprisoned within their own bodies  but they do have a mind. There was a very interesting film  one of the rare good films done about a situation like this  by Julian Schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition. So now I'm going to show you a picture. I promise not to say anything about this  except this is to frighten you. It's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem  there are  to make it simple  all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior  different aspects of our body. They are exquisitely topographic and they are exquisitely interconnected in a recursive pattern. And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe    and I could be wrong  but I don't think I am    that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings    primordial feelings  by the way. So what is the picture that we get here  Look at  cerebral cortex   look at  brain stem   look at  body   and you get the picture of the interconnectivity in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body. And you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are  in fact  the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to  as we should  because that's really the film that is rolling in our minds. But look at the arrows. They're not there for looks. They're there because there's this very close interaction. You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem. You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body. Another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species. So throughout vertebrates  the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours  which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious minds like we do. Except that they're not as rich as ours  because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do. That's where the difference is. And I strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great product of the cerebral cortex. Only the wealth of our minds is  not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence  and that we have any sense of person. Now there are three levels of self to consider    the proto  the core and the autobiographical. The first two are shared with many  many other species  and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species. It's the autobiographical self which some species have  I think. Cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree. And everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree. But the novelty is here. The autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made  it's the lived past and the anticipated future. And the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory  reasoning  imagination  creativity and language. And out of that came the instruments of culture    religions  justice  trade  the arts  science  technology. And it is within that culture that we really can get    and this is the novelty    something that is not entirely set by our biology. It is developed in the cultures. It developed in collectives of human beings. And this is  of course  the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio cultural regulation. And finally  you could rightly ask  why care about this  Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made  Three reasons. First  curiosity. Primates are extremely curious    and humans most of all. And if we are interested  for example  in the fact that anti gravity is pulling galaxies away from the Earth  why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings  Second  understanding society and culture. We should look at how society and culture in this socio cultural regulation are a work in progress. And finally  medicine. Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression  Alzheimer's disease  drug addiction. Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious. You have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a non serendipitous way if you do not know how this works. So that's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we're doing  and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains. Thank you for your attention. I study how the brain processes information. That is  how it takes information in from the outside world  and converts it into patterns of electrical activity  and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things    to see  hear  to reach for an object. So I'm really a basic scientist  not a clinician  but in the last year and a half I've started to switch over  to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices  and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this. It's really our first foray into this. It's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness. So let me start in on that problem. There are    million people in the U.S. and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina  diseases like macular degeneration  and there's little that can be done for them. There are some drug treatments  but they're only effective on a small fraction of the population. And so  for the vast majority of patients  their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices. The problem is that current prosthetics don't work very well. They're still very limited in the vision that they can provide. And so  you know  for example  with these devices  patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges  not very much more  so nothing close to normal vision has been possible. So what I'm going to tell you about today is a device that we've been working on that I think has the potential to make a difference  to be much more effective  and what I wanted to do is show you how it works. Okay  so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve. Here you have a retina. So you have an image  a retina  and a brain. So when you look at something  like this image of this baby's face  it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina  on the front end cells here  the photoreceptors. Then what happens is the retinal circuitry  the middle part  goes to work on it  and what it does is it performs operations on it  it extracts information from it  and it converts that information into a code. And the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain  and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code. And when I say code  I do literally mean code. Like this pattern of pulses here actually means  baby's face   and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses  it knows that what was out there was a baby's face  and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was  say  a dog  or another pattern would be a house. Anyway  you get the idea. And  of course  in real life  it's all dynamic  meaning that it's changing all the time  so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you're looking at is changing all the time too. So  you know  it's sort of a complicated thing. You have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you're seeing. So what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration  What happens is is that  the front end cells die  the photoreceptors die  and over time  all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them  they die too. Until the only things that you have left are these cells here  the output cells  the ones that send the signals to the brain  but because of all that degeneration they aren't sending any signals anymore. They aren't getting any input  so the person's brain no longer gets any visual information    that is  he or she is blind. So  a solution to the problem  then  would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front end circuitry and send signals to the retina's output cells  and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain. So this is what we've been working on  and this is what our prosthetic does. So it consists of two parts  what we call an encoder and a transducer. And so the encoder does just what I was saying  it mimics the actions of the front end circuitry    so it takes images in and converts them into the retina's code. And then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain  and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output. So a completely blind retina  even one with no front end circuitry at all  no photoreceptors  can now send out normal signals  signals that the brain can understand. So no other device has been able to do this. Okay  so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing  because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool. I'm not sure  cool  is really the right word  but you know what I mean. So what it's doing is  it's replacing the retinal circuitry  really the guts of the retinal circuitry  with a set of equations  a set of equations that we can implement on a chip. So it's just math. In other words  we're not literally replacing the components of the retina. It's not like we're making a little mini device for each of the different cell types. We've just abstracted what the retina's doing with a set of equations. And so  in a way  the equations are serving as sort of a codebook. An image comes in  goes through the set of equations  and out comes streams of electrical pulses  just like a normal retina would produce. Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output  and what the implications of this are. Here are three sets of firing patterns. The top one is from a normal animal  the middle one is from a blind animal that's been treated with this encoder transducer device  and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic. So the bottom one is the state of the art device that's out there right now  which is basically made up of light detectors  but no encoder. So what we did was we presented movies of everyday things    people  babies  park benches  you know  regular things happening    and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals. Now just to orient you  each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells  and just as in the previous slides  each row is a different cell  and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so I could show you a long stretch of data. So as you can see  the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns    and it's not perfect  but it's pretty good    and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic  the responses really don't. And so with the standard method  the cells do fire  they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code. How important is this  What's the potential impact on a patient's ability to see  So I'm just going to show you one bottom line experiment that answers this  and of course I've got a lot of other data  so if you're interested I'm happy to show more. So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment. So what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked  what was the retina seeing at that moment  Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns  So  when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer. So let me show you  and I'm going to start with the standard method first. So you can see that it's pretty limited  and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code  they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there. So you can see that there's something there  but it's not so clear what that something is  and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning  that with the standard method  patients can see high contrast edges  they can see light  but it doesn't easily go further than that. So what was the image  It was a baby's face. So what about with our approach  adding the code  And you can see that it's much better. Not only can you tell that it's a baby's face  but you can tell that it's this baby's face  which is a really challenging task. So on the left is the encoder alone  and on the right is from an actual blind retina  so the encoder and the transducer. But the key one really is the encoder alone  because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer. This is just actually the first one that we tried. I just wanted to say something about the standard method. When this first came out  it was just a really exciting thing  the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all. But there was this limiting factor  the issue of the code  and how to make the cells respond better  produce normal responses  and so this was our contribution. Now I just want to wrap up  and as I was mentioning earlier of course I have a lot of other data if you're interested  but I just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language  and the potential power of being able to do that. So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device. Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood  and be understood by the brain. And then the last thing I wanted to say  really  is to emphasize that the idea generalizes. So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas  for example  the auditory system and the motor system  so for treating deafness and for motor disorders. So just the same way that we were able to jump over the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's output cells  we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve  or jump over damaged areas in the cortex  in the motor cortex  to bridge the gap produced by a stroke. I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really  really important  and if we can understand the code  the language of the brain  things become possible that didn't seem obviously possible before. Thank you. Do you remember the story of Odysseus and the Sirens from high school or junior high school  There was this hero  Odysseus  who's heading back home after the Trojan War. And he's standing on the deck of his ship  he's talking to his first mate  and he's saying   Tomorrow  we will sail past those rocks  and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens. And these women sing an enchanting song  a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die.  Now you would expect  given that  that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens  but instead Odysseus says   I want to hear that song. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men    stay with me    so that you can't hear the song  and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that I can listen and we can all sail by unaffected.  So this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song. And I'd like to think if this was the case  they probably would have rehearsed it a few times. Odysseus would have said   Okay  let's do a dry run. You tie me to the mast  and I'm going to beg and plead. And no matter what I say  you cannot untie me from the mast. All right  so tie me to the mast.  And the first mate takes a rope and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot. And Odysseus does his best job playacting and says   Untie me. Untie me. I want to hear that song. Untie me.  And the first mate wisely resists and doesn't untie Odysseus. And then Odysseus says   I see that you can get it. All right  untie me now and we'll get some dinner.  And the first mate hesitates. He's like   Is this still the rehearsal  or should I untie him   And the first mate thinks   Well  I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end.  So he unties Odysseus  and Odysseus flips out. He's like   You idiot. You moron. If you do that tomorrow  I'll be dead  you'll be dead  every single one of the men will be dead. Now just don't untie me no matter what.  He throws the first mate to the ground. This repeats itself through the night    rehearsal  tying to the mast  conning his way out of it  beating the poor first mate up mercilessly. Hilarity ensues. Tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device. A commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don't do something regrettable when you have a hot head. Because there's two heads inside one person when you think about it. Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation. There is first  the present self. This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song. He just wants to get to the front row. He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification. But then there's this other self  the future self. This is Odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife Penelope outside of Ithaca    the other one. So why do we need commitment devices  Well resisting temptation is hard  as the   th century English economist Nassau William Senior said   To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power  or to seek distant rather than immediate results  are among the most painful exertions of the human will.  If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people  you probably realize it's not that your goals are physically impossible that's keeping you from achieving them  it's that you lack the self discipline to stick to them. It's physically possible to lose weight. It's physically possible to exercise more. But resisting temptation is hard. The other reason that it's difficult to resist temptation is because it's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self. I mean  let's face it  the present self is present. It's in control. It's in power right now. It has these strong  heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth. And the future self is not even around. It's off in the future. It's weak. It doesn't even have a lawyer present. There's nobody to stick up for the future self. And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams. So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought  and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two. Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually. Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one  but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it or unplugging your Internet connection so you can use your computer. I was creating commitment devices of my own long before I knew what they were. So when I was a starving post doc at Columbia University  I was deep in a publish or perish phase of my career. I had to write five pages a day towards papers or I would have to give up five dollars. And when you try to execute these commitment devices  you realize the devil is really in the details. Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars. I mean  you can't burn it  that's illegal. And I thought  well I could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that. But then I thought  oh  I'm sending myself mixed messages. Because not writing is bad  but giving to charity is good. So then I would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift. And then I kind of flipped that around and thought  well I could give it to the neo Nazis. But then I was like  that's more bad than writing is good  and so that wouldn't work. So ultimately  I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway. Sometimes a good person would find it  sometimes a bad person would find it. On average  it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that I would regret. Such it is with commitment devices. But despite my like for them  there's two nagging concerns that I've always had about commitment devices  and you might feel this if you use them yourself. So the first is  when you've got one of these devices going  such as this contract to write everyday or pay  it's just a constant reminder that you have no self control. You're just telling yourself   Without you  commitment device  I am nothing  I have no self discipline.  And then when you're ever in a situation where you don't have a commitment device in place    like   Oh my God  that person's offering me a doughnut  and I have no defense mechanism      you just eat it. So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you. I think self discipline is something  it's like a muscle. The more you exercise it  the stronger it gets. The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them. You say   Well  of course I can't write today  because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews  and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that. And so there's no way that this is going to work.  So in effect  you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person. You're putting yourself  you're binding yourself  and you're weaseling your way out of it  and then you're beating yourself up afterwards. So I've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people's relationship to the future self without using commitment devices. In particular  I'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self. And this is a timely issue. I'm talking about the topic of saving. Now saving is a classic two selves problem. The present self does not want to save at all. It wants to consume. Whereas the future self wants the present self to save. So this is a timely problem. We look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the     s. At the same time  the Retirement Risk Index  the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement  has been increasing. And we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers  the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre retirement needs while they're in retirement. So what can we do about this  There's a philosopher  Derek Parfit  who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I. He said that   We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination.  That is to say  we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old  or we might not be able to imagine that we're going to get old some day. On the one hand  it sounds ridiculous. Of course  we know that we're going to get old. But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time  So my coauthors and I have used computers  the greatest tool of our time  to assist people's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future. And I'll show you some of these tools right here. The first is called the distribution builder. It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future. Each outcome is shown by one of these markers  and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement. Being up at the top means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement. Being down at the bottom means that you're struggling to make ends meet. When you make an investment  what you're really saying is   I accept that any one of these     things could happen to me and determine my wealth.  Now you can try to move your outcomes around. You can try to manipulate your fate  like this person is doing  but it costs you something to do it. It means that you have to save more today. Once you find an investment that you're happy with  what people do is they click  done  and the markers begin to disappear  slowly  one by one. It simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out. At the end  there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement. Yes  this person retired at     percent of their working income in retirement. They're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working. If you're like most people  just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy    just to think about making    percent more money in retirement than before. However  had you ended up on the very bottom  it might have given you a slight sense of dread and or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement. By using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome  people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well being in the future. Now people are motivated through emotions  but different people find different things motivating. This is a simulation that uses graphics  but other people find motivating what money can buy  not just numbers. So here I made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes  I show people what those outcomes will get you  in particular apartments that you can afford if you're retiring on                     dollars per month and so on. As you move down the ladder of apartments  you see that they get worse and worse. Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student. And as you get to the very bottom  you're faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don't save anything for retirement  you won't be able to afford any housing at all. Those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the Internet. The last thing I'll show you  the last behavioral time machine  is something that I created with Hal Hershfield  who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project  Bill Sharpe. And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality. So what we do is we take pictures of people    in this case  college age people    and we use software to age them and show these people what they'll look like when they're            years old. And we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior. So this is one of our experiments. Here we see the face of the young subject on the left. He's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate. As he moves his savings rate down  it means that he's saving zero when it's all the way here at the left. You can see his current annual income    this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today    is quite high     percent  but his retirement income is quite low. He's going to retire on    percent of what he earned while he was working. If he saves the maximum legal amount  his retirement income goes up  but he's unhappy because now he has less money on the left hand side to spend today. Other conditions show people the future self. And from the future self's point of view  everything is in reverse. If you save very little  the future self is unhappy living on    percent of the income. Whereas if the present self saves a lot  the future self is delighted  where the income is close up near     percent. To bring this to a wider audience  I've been working with Hal and Allianz to create something we call the behavioral time machine  in which you not only get to see yourself in the future  but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth. So for instance  here is somebody using the tool. And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider. The younger face gets happier and happier  saving nothing. The older face is miserable. And slowly  slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate. And then it's a high savings rate. The younger face is getting unhappy. The older face is quite pleased with the decision. We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do. And what's nice about it is it's not something that biasing people actually  because as one face smiles  the other face frowns. It's not telling you which way to put the slider  it's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self. Your decisions today are going to determine its well being. And that's something that's easy to forget. This use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older. There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke  if they get too much exposure to the sun  if they gain weight and so on. And what's good is  unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith  you don't have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality. There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing. This is actually a picture of Hal  my coauthor. You might recognize him from the previous demos. And just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding  aging and weight gain software to see how he would look. Hal is here  so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image. And I'll close it there. On behalf of Hal and myself  I wish all the best to your present and future selves. Thank you. In       I walked into a prison in Cambodia  and I met a    year old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel. And as I looked into his eyes  I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners  that I would never have written a letter for him  because he was not a    year old boy who had done something important for anybody. He was not a political prisoner. He was a    year old boy who had stolen a bicycle. What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia  but of the     developing countries that torture     of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured. And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool. We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst  but  in fact     percent of torture today is not for political prisoners. It is for people who are in broken down legal systems  and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation    it's cheaper than having a legal system  cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel    it is what happens most of the time. I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community  if we make a decision  to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime  but it will require three things. First is the training  empowerment  and connection of defenders worldwide. The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel. And the third is commitment. So in the year       I began to wonder  what if we came together  Could we do something for these    countries  And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the    countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms. My first experiences  though  did come from Cambodia  and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were  in       still less than    attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all. And even    years later  there was only    lawyers in the country  so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet    year old boys  you'd meet women and you'd say   Why are you here   Women would say   Well I've been here for    years because my husband committed a crime  but they can't find him.  So it's just a place where there was no rule of law. The first group of defenders came together and I still remember  as I was training  I said   Okay  what do you do for an investigation   And there was silence in the class  and finally one woman stood up   inaudible name   and she said  Khrew   which means  teacher.  She said   I have defended more than a hundred people  and I've never had to do any investigation  because they all come with confessions.  And we talked about  as a class  the fact that number one  the confessions might not be reliable  but number two  we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this  especially as it was now against the law. And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws. And I still remember the first cases where they came  all    together  she would stand up  and they were in the back  and they would support her  and the judges kept saying   No  no  no  no  we're going to do things the exact same way we've been doing them.  But one day the perfect case came  and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller  she was sitting outside of a house. She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was  but the police came  they got her  there was nothing on her. She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried. And when they brought her case to the judge  for the first time he stood up and he said   Yes  there's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released.  And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see  they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia. But Cambodia is not alone. I used to think  well is it Cambodia  Or is it other countries  But it is in so many countries. In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a    year old boy  it was an   year old boy for stealing a mobile phone. Or a woman  I picked up her baby  really cute baby  I said  Your baby is so cute.  It wasn't a baby  she was three. And she said  Yeah  but she's why I'm here   because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison. And when I walked up to the prison director  I said   You've got to let her out. A judge would let her out.  And he said   Okay  we can talk about it  but look at my prison. Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer. What can we do   So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases. But we realized that it's not only the training of the lawyers  but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference. For example  in Cambodia  it was that  inaudible name  did not go alone but she had    lawyers with her who stood up together. And in the same way  in China  they always tell me   It's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together.  Or in Zimbabwe  where I remember Innocent  after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said   I've been here for one year  eight years     years without a lawyer   he came and we had a training together and he said   I have heard it said     because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling     I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources.  And then he said   But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice.  And with that  he successfully organized    lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases. The key that we see  though  is training and then early access. I was recently in Egypt  and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers  and what they told me is that they said   Hey  look  we don't have police on the streets now. The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution. They were torturing everybody all the time.  And I said   But there's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here. What's going on   I met with one of the development agencies  and they were training prosecutors and judges  which is the normal bias  as opposed to defenders. And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual. I said   I'm gonna copy this.  It had everything in it. Lawyers can come at the police station. It was perfect. Prosecutors were perfectly trained. But I said to them   I just have one question  which is  by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor's office  what had happened to them   And after a pause  they said   They had been tortured.  So the pieces are  not only the training of the lawyers  but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel  because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured. And as I tell you this  I'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like   Oh  okay  it sounds like we could do it  but can we really do it   Because it sounds big. And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible. The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment. It's not only Innocent  who I told you about in Zimbabwe  but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces. We have a program called JusticeMakers  and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things  but how can we support them  So it's an online contest where it's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice. And there are    JusticeMakers throughout the world  from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC  who with five thousand dollars do amazing things  through SMS programs  through paralegal programs  through whatever they can do. And it's not only these JusticeMakers  but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward. So in China  for instance  great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished. And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers  and said   How can we get this out  How can we make sure that this is implemented  This is fantastic.  And he said to me   Well  do you have money   And I said   No.  And he said   That's okay  we can still figure it out.  And on December    he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League  from    of the top law schools  who organized themselves  developed posters with the new laws  and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights. So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders. We need to systematically implement early access to counsel. But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this. And people often say to me   You know  this is great  but it's wildly idealistic. Never going to happen.  And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery  or end apartheid. It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit. Now  there's one of our favorite poems from the defenders  which they share from each other  is   Take courage friends  the road is often long  the path is never clear  and the stakes are very high  but deep down  you are not alone.  And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders  but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it  we can end torture as an investigative tool. I end always  because I'm sure the questions are    and I'd be happy to talk to you at any point     But what can I really do   Well  I would say this. First of all  you know what you can do. But second of all  I would leave you with the story of Vishna  who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice. Vishna was a   year old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province. But because he was born in the prison  everybody loved him  including the guards  so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars. So  you know  there's bars. And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger  which means what gets bigger  Your head gets bigger. So he would come to the first bar  the second bar and then the third bar  and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through  and come back  third  second  first. And he would grab my pinkie  because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit. You know  he never quite made it to all of them every day  but he wanted to visit all     prisoners. And I would lift him  and he would put his fingers through. Or if they were dark cells  it was like iron corrugated  and he would put his fingers through. And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine  and they looked forward to him. And I was like  here's Vishna. He's a   year old boy. He was born in a prison with almost nothing  no material goods  but he had a sense of his own heroic journey  which I believe we are all born into. He said   Probably I can't do everything. But I'm one. I can do something. And I will do the one thing that I can do.  So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together  and invite you into this journey with us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I've been in Afghanistan for    years. I work for the Red Cross and I'm a physical therapist. My job is to make arms and legs    well it's not completely true. We do more than that. We provide the patients  the Afghan disabled  first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration. It's a very logical plan  but it was not always like this. For many years  we were just providing them with artificial limbs. It took quite many years for the program to become what it is now. Today  I would like to tell you a story  the story of a big change  and the story of the people who made this change possible. I arrived in Afghanistan in      to work in a hospital for war victims. And then  not only for war victims  but it was for any kind of patient. I was also working in the orthopedic center  we call it. This is the place where we make the legs. At that time I found myself in a strange situation. I felt not quite ready for that job. There was so much to learn. There were so many things new to me. But it was a terrific job. But as soon as the fighting intensified  the physical rehabilitation was suspended. There were many other things to do. So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority. It was a strange sensation. Anyway  you know every time I make this speech    it's not the first time    but it's an emotion. It's something that comes out from the past. It's    years  but they are still all there. Anyway  in       the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan. And the orthopedic center was closed. I was assigned to work for the homeless  for the internally displaced people. But one day  something happened. I was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions. I wanted to go home. I was driving. You know  when you want to forget  you don't want to see things  so you just want to go to your room  to lock yourself inside and say   That's enough.  A bomb fell not far from my car    well  far enough  but big noise. And everybody disappeared from the street. The cars disappeared as well. I ducked. And only one figure remained in the middle of the road. It was a man in a wheelchair desperately trying to move away. Well I'm not a particularly brave person  I have to confess it  but I could not just ignore him. So I stopped the car and I went to help. The man was without legs and only with one arm. Behind him there was a child  his son  red in the face in an effort to push the father. So I took him into a safe place. And I ask   What are you doing out in the street in this situation    I work   he said. I wondered  what work  And then I ask an even more stupid question   Why don't you have the prostheses  Why don't you have the artificial legs   And he said   The Red Cross has closed.  Well without thinking  I told him  Come tomorrow. We will provide you with a pair of legs.  The man  his name was Mahmoud  and the child  whose name was Rafi  left. And then I said   Oh  my God. What did I say  The center is closed  no staff around. Maybe the machinery is broken. Who is going to make the legs for him   So I hoped that he would not come. This is the streets of Kabul in those days. So I said   Well I will give him some money.  And so the following day  I went to the orthopedic center. And I spoke with a gatekeeper. I was ready to tell him   Listen  if someone such and such comes tomorrow  please tell him that it was a mistake. Nothing can be done. Give him some money.  But Mahmoud and his son were already there. And they were not alone. There were     maybe     people like him waiting. And there was some staff too. Among them there was my right hand man  Najmuddin. And the gatekeeper told me   They come everyday to see if the center will open.  I said   No. We have to go away. We cannot stay here.  They were bombing    not very close    but you could hear the noise of the bombs. So   We cannot stay here  it's dangerous. It's not a priority.  But Najmuddin told me   Listen now  we're here.  At least we can start repairing the prostheses  the broken prostheses of the people and maybe try to do something for people like Mahmoud.  I said   No  please. We cannot do that. It's really dangerous. We have other things to do.  But they insisted. When you have    people in front of you  looking at you and you are the one who has to decide ... So we started doing some repairs. Also one of the physical therapists reported that Mahmoud could be provided with a leg  but not immediately. The legs were swollen and the knees were stiff  so he needed a long preparation. Believe me  I was worried because I was breaking the rules. I was doing something that I was not supposed to do. In the evening  I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters  and I told them    I lied    I told them   Listen  we are going to start a couple of hours per day  just a few repairs.  Maybe some of them are here now. So we started. I was working  I was going everyday to work for the homeless. And Najmuddin was staying there  doing everything and reporting on the patients. He was telling me   Patients are coming.  We knew that many more patients could not come  prevented by the fighting. But people were coming. And Mahmoud was coming every day. And slowly  slowly week after week his legs were improving. The stump or cast prosthesis was made  and he was starting the real physical rehabilitation. He was coming every day  crossing the front line. A couple of times I crossed the front line in the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing. I tell you  it was something so sinister that I was astonished he could do it every day. But finally  the great day arrived. Mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs. It was April  I remember  a very beautiful day. April in Kabul is beautiful  full of roses  full of flowers. We could not possibly stay indoors  with all these sandbags at the windows. Very sad  dark. So we chose a small spot in the garden. And Mahmoud put on his prostheses  the other patients did the same  and they started practicing for the last time before being discharged. Suddenly  they started fighting. Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting. We could hear in the air the bullets passing. So we dashed  all of us  towards the shelter. Mahmoud grabbed his son  I grabbed someone else. Everybody was grabbing something. And we ran. You know     meters can be a long distance if you are totally exposed  but we managed to reach the shelter. Inside  all of us panting  I sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father   Father  you can run faster than me.  And Mahmoud   Of course I can. I can run  and now you can go to school. No need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair.  Later on  we took them home. And I will never forget Mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair. And then I understood  physical rehabilitation is a priority. Dignity cannot wait for better times. From that day on  we never closed a single day. Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours  but we never  we never closed it again. I met Mahmoud one year later. He was in good shape    a bit thinner. He needed to change his prostheses    a new pair of prostheses. I asked about his son. He told me   He's at school. He'd doing quite well.  But I understood he wanted to tell me something. So I asked him   What is that   He was sweating. He was clearly embarrassed. And he was standing in front of me  his head down. He said   You have taught me to walk. Thank you very much. Now help me not to be a beggar anymore.  That was the job.  My children are growing. I feel ashamed. I don't want them to be teased at school by the other students.  I said   Okay.  I thought  how much money do I have in my pocket  Just to give him some money. It was the easiest way. He read my mind  and he said   I ask for a job.  And then he added something I will never forget for the rest of my life. He said   I am a scrap of a man  but if you help me  I'm ready to do anything  even if I have to crawl on the ground.  And then he sat down. I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere. Legless  with only one arm  illiterate  unskilled    what job for him  Najmuddin told me   Well we have a vacancy in the carpentry shop.   What   I said   Stop.   Well yes  we need to increase the production of feet. We need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet. We need to increase the production.   Excuse me   I could not believe. And then he said   No  we can modify the workbench maybe to put a special stool  a special anvil  special vice  and maybe an electric screwdriver.  I said   Listen  it's insane. And it's even cruel to think of anything like this. That's a production line and a very fast one. It's cruel to offer him a job knowing that he's going to fail.  But with Najmuddin  we cannot discuss. So the only things I could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise. Only one week    one week try and not a single day more. One week later  Mahmoud was the fastest in the production line. I told Najmuddin   That's a trick. I can't believe it.  The production was up    percent.  It's a trick  it's a trick   I said. And then I asked for verification. It was true. The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove. I understood that I was wrong again. Mahmoud had looked taller. I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling. He was a new man  taller again. Of course  I understood that what made him stand tall    yeah they were the legs  thank you very much    but as a first step  it was the dignity. He has regained his full dignity thanks to that job. So of course  I understood. And then we started a new policy    a new policy completely different. We decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job. It became a policy of  positive discrimination   we call it now. And you know what  It's good for everybody. Everybody benefits from that    those employed  of course  because they get a job and dignity. But also for the newcomers. They are       every year    people coming for the first time. And you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them. Sometimes you see them  they look   Oh.  And you see the faces. And then the surprise turns into hope. And it's easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability. Poof  they learn much faster    the motivation  the empathy they can establish with the patient is completely different  completely. Scraps of men do not exist. People like Mahmoud are agents of change. And when you start changing  you cannot stop. So employing people  yes  but also we started programming projects of microfinance  education. And when you start  you cannot stop. So you do vocational training  home education for those who cannot go to school. Physical therapies can be done  not only in the orthopedic center  but also in the houses of the people. There is always a better way to do things. That's Najmuddin  the one with the white coat. Terrible Najmuddin  is that one. I have learned a lot from people like Najmuddin  Mahmoud  Rafi. They are my teachers. I have a wish  a big wish  that this way of working  this way of thinking  is going to be implemented in other countries. There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan. It is possible and it is not difficult. All we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist  to make them part of the decision making process and then  of course  to adapt. This is my big wish. Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over  not at all. We are going on. Recently we have just started a program  a sport program    basketball for wheelchair users. We transport the wheelchairs everywhere. We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan. At the beginning  when Anajulina told me   We would like to start it   I hesitated. I said   No   you can imagine. I said   No  no  no  no  we can't.  And then I asked the usual question   Is it a priority  Is it really necessary   Well now you should see me. I never miss a single training session. The night before a match I'm very nervous. And you should see me during the match. I shout like a true Italian. What's next  What is going to be the next change  Well I don't know yet  but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends  they have it already in mind. That was my story. Thank you very much. I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation  hopefully for a good cause  which is self improvement. And I've done this in three parts. So first I started with the mind. And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z    or  more precisely  from  a ak  to  Zywiec.  And here's a little image of that. And this was an amazing year. It was really a fascinating journey. It was painful at times  especially for those around me. My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation. So it had its downsides. But after that  I decided to work on the spirit. As I mentioned last year  I grew up with no religion at all. I'm Jewish  but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. Not really. But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it. So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible. And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard    because Leviticus says you cannot shave. So this is what I looked like by the end. Thank you for that reaction. I look a little like Moses  or Ted Kaczynski. I got both of them. So there was the topiary there. And there's the sheep. Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be  the healthiest person alive. So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years. And I just finished a couple of months ago. And I have to say  thank God. Because living so healthily was killing me. It was so overwhelming  because the amount of things you have to do  it's just mind boggling. I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers. And they were telling me all the things I had to do. I had to eat right  exercise  meditate  pet dogs  because that lowers the blood pressure. I wrote the book on a treadmill  and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book. I had to put on sunscreen. This was no small feat  because if you listen to dermatologists  they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen. And you have to reapply it every two to four hours. So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen. I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year. There was the washing of hands. I had to do that properly. And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house  because those are just orgies of germs. So that took a lot of time. I also tried to be the safest person I could be  because that's a part of health. I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council. They started a public campaign that says   A walking helmet is a good helmet.  So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking  but also for walking around. And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets. Well yeah  I tried that. Now it's a little extreme  I admit. But if you think about this  this is actually    the  Freakonomics  authors wrote about this    that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving. So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. So I finished  and it was a success in a sense. All of the markers went in the right direction. My cholesterol went down  I lost weight  my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant. So that was nice. And it was successful overall. But I also learned that I was too healthy  and that was unhealthy. I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family. And as Dan Buettner can tell you  having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. So I finished. And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over. I went to the dark side  and I just indulged myself. It was like something out of Caligula. Without the sex part. Because I have three young kids  so that wasn't happening. But the over eating and over drinking  definitely. And I finally have stabilized. So now I'm back to adopting many    not all  I don't wear a helmet anymore    but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year. It was really a life changing project. And I  of course  don't have time to go into all of them. Let me just tell you two really quickly. The first is    and this was surprising to me  I didn't expect this to come out    but I live a much quieter life now. Because we live in such a noisy world. There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly  he's very noisy. And this is a real underestimated  under appreciated health hazard    not just because it harms our hearing  which it obviously does  but it actually initiates the fight or flight response. A loud noise will get your fight or flight response going. And this  over the years  can cause real damage  cardiovascular damage. The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year. And it was done in Europe. And they estimated that  .  million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution. So they think it's actually very deadly. And by the way  it's also terrible for your brain. It really impairs cognition. And our Founding Fathers knew about this. When they wrote the Constitution  they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate. So without noise reduction technology  our country would not exist. So as a patriot  I felt it was important to    I wear all the earplugs and the earphones  and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way. And the second point I want to make  the final point  is that    and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED    that joy is so important to your health  that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them. And just to give you one instance of this  food. The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food. To give just one example  we love crunchiness  mouthfeel. So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes    throw in some sunflower seeds. And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos. And it has made me a healthier person. So that is it. The book about it comes out in April. It's called  Drop Dead Healthy.  And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour. That's my greatest hope. So thank you very much. There have been many revolutions over the last century  but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution. We are living on average today    years longer than our great grandparents did. Think about that. That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan. And yet  for the most part  our culture has not come to terms with what this means. We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That's the metaphor  the old metaphor. You're born  you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude. Age as pathology. But many people today    philosophers  artists  doctors  scientists    are taking a new look at what I call the third act  the last three decades of life. They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance    as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood. And they are asking    we should all be asking    how do we use this time  How do we live it successfully  What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging  I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject. And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase    the upward ascension of the human spirit  bringing us into wisdom  wholeness and authenticity. Age not at all as pathology  age as potential. And guess what  This potential is not for the lucky few. It turns out  most people over    feel better  are less stressed  are less hostile  less anxious. We tend to see commonalities more than differences. Some of the studies even say we're happier. This is not what I expected  trust me. I come from a long line of depressives. As I was approaching my late   s  when I would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative. And I got scared. I thought  oh my gosh. I'm going to become a crotchety old lady. But now that I am actually smack dab in the middle of my own third act  I realize I've never been happier. I have such a powerful feeling of well being. And I've discovered that when you're inside oldness  as opposed to looking at it from the outside  fear subsides. You realize  you're still yourself    maybe even more so. Picasso once said   It takes a long time to become young.  I don't want to romanticize aging. Obviously  there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth. Some of it is a matter of luck. Some of it  obviously  is genetic. One third of it  in fact  is genetic. And there isn't much we can do about that. But that means that two thirds of how well we do in the third act  we can do something about. We're going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference. Now let me say something about the staircase  which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs. Myself included. As you may know  the entire world operates on a universal law  entropy  the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy means that everything in the world  everything  is in a state of decline and decay  the arch. There's only one exception to this universal law  and that is the human spirit  which can continue to evolve upwards    the staircase    bringing us into wholeness  authenticity and wisdom. And here's an example of what I mean. This upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges. About three years ago  I read an article in the New York Times. It was about a man named Neil Selinger       years old  a retired lawyer    who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer's voice. Two years later  he was diagnosed with ALS  commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a terrible disease. It's fatal. It wastes the body  but the mind remains intact. In this article  Mr. Selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him. And I quote   As my muscles weakened  my writing became stronger. As I slowly lost my speech  I gained my voice. As I diminished  I grew. As I lost so much  I finally started to find myself.  Neil Selinger  to me  is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act. Now we're all born with spirit  all of us  but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life  violence  abuse  neglect. Perhaps our parents suffered from depression. Perhaps they weren't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world. Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain  a wound. Perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure. And so we can feel unfinished. Perhaps the task of the third act is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves. For me  it began as I was approaching my third act  my   th birthday. How was I supposed to live it  What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act  And I realized that  in order to know where I was going  I had to know where I'd been. And so I went back and I studied my first two acts  trying to see who I was then  who I really was    not who my parents or other people told me I was  or treated me like I was. But who was I  Who were my parents    not as parents  but as people  Who were my grandparents  How did they treat my parents  These kinds of things. I discovered a couple of years later that this process that I had gone through is called by psychologists  doing a life review.  And they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person's life. You may discover  as I did  that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault  a lot of things you used to think about yourself  really had nothing to do with you. It wasn't your fault  you're just fine. And you're able to go back and forgive them and forgive yourself. You're able to free yourself from your past. You can work to change your relationship to your past. Now while I was writing about this  I came upon a book called  Man's Search for Meaning  by Viktor Frankl. Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist who'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp. And he wrote that  while he was in the camp  he could tell  should they ever be released  which of the people would be okay and which would not. And he wrote this   Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing  your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. This is what determines the quality of the life we've lived    not whether we've been rich or poor  famous or unknown  healthy or suffering. What determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities  what kind of meaning we assign them  what kind of attitude we cling to about them  what state of mind we allow them to trigger.  Perhaps the central purpose of the third act is to go back and to try  if appropriate  to change our relationship to the past. It turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this  it manifests neurologically    neural pathways are created in the brain. You see  if you have  over time  reacted negatively to past events and people  neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain. And over time  these neural pathways become hardwired  they become the norm    even if it's bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety. If however  we can go back and alter our relationship  re vision our relationship to past people and events  neural pathways can change. And if we can maintain the more positive feelings about the past  that becomes the new norm. It's like resetting a thermostat. It's not having experiences that make us wise  it's reflecting on the experiences that we've had that makes us wise    and that helps us become whole  brings wisdom and authenticity. It helps us become what we might have been. Women start off whole  don't we  I mean  as girls  we start off feisty     Yeah  who says   We have agency. We are the subjects of our own lives. But very often  many  if not most of us  when we hit puberty  we start worrying about fitting in and being popular. And we become the subjects and objects of other people's lives. But now  in our third acts  it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started and know it for the first time. And if we can do that  it will not just be for ourselves. Older women are the largest demographic in the world. If we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole  this will create a cultural shift in the world  and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan. Thank you very much. There's a poem written by a very famous English poet at the end of the   th century. It was said to echo in Churchill's brain in the     s. And the poem goes   On the idle hill of summer  lazy with the flow of streams  hark I hear a distant drummer  drumming like a sound in dreams  far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by  dear to friend and food to powder  soldiers marching  soon to die.  Those who are interested in poetry  the poem is  A Shropshire Lad  written by A.E. Housman. But what Housman understood  and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too  was that the long  hot  silvan summers of stability of the   th century were coming to a close  and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes. And these are always periods  ladies and gentlemen  accompanied by turbulence  and all too often by blood. And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned  if you like  to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world  the new powers that exist in the world  are beginning to take form. And these are    and we see it very clearly today    nearly always highly turbulent times  highly difficult times  and all too often very bloody times. By the way  it happens about once every century. You might argue that the last time it happened    and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too    was that when power passed from the old nations  the old powers of Europe  across the Atlantic to the new emerging power of the United States of America    the beginning of the American century. And of course  into the vacuum where the too old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century    the one in the first part and the one in the second part  the two great World Wars. Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars  and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them. Well  ladies and gentlemen  we live at one of those times. But for us  I want to talk about three factors today. And the first of these  the first two of these  is about a shift in power. And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to  which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now. But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world. And what is happening today is  in one sense  frightening because it's never happened before. We have seen lateral shifts of power    the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations    but we are seeing something slightly different. For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation. It's also moving vertically. What's happening today is that the power that was encased  held to accountability  held to the rule of law  within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage. The globalization of power    we talk about the globalization of markets  but actually it's the globalization of real power. And where  at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law  on the international stage it is not. The international stage and the global stage where power now resides  the power of the Internet  the power of the satellite broadcasters  the power of the money changers    this vast money go round that circulates now    times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance    the money changers  if you like  the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently  the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium sized countries. These live in a global space which is largely unregulated  not subject to the rule of law  and in which people may act free of constraint. Now that suits the powerful up to a moment. It's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint  but the lesson of history is that  sooner or later  unregulated space    space not subject to the rule of law    becomes populated  not just by the things you wanted    international trade  the Internet  etc.    but also by the things you don't want    international criminality  international terrorism. The revelation of      is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth  nevertheless  those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright September morning. It's said that something like    percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund      actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers which      destroyed. You see  our enemies also use this space    the space of mass travel  the Internet  satellite broadcasters    to be able to get around their poison  which is about destroying our systems and our ways. Sooner or later  sooner or later  the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow. And if it is therefore the case  as I believe it is  that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power  then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space. And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim  to bring governance to the global space. Now notice  I'm not talking about government. I'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution. My own view  by the way  ladies and gentlemen  is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions. If we didn't have the U.N.  we'd have to invent it. The world needs an international forum. It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action. But when it comes to governance of the global space  my guess is this won't happen through the creation of more U.N. institutions. It will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty based systems  treaty based agreements  to govern that global space. And if you look  you can see them happening  already beginning to emerge. The World Trade Organization  treaty based organization  entirely treaty based  and yet  powerful enough to hold even the most powerful  the United States  to account if necessary. Kyoto  the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty based organization. The G    we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation. And that's what the G   is  a treaty based institution. Now there's a problem there  and we'll come back to it in a minute  which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty based institutions  to fill that governance space  then what happens to the weak who are left out  And that's a big problem  and we'll return to it in just a second. So there's my first message  that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently  then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space. And watch that beginning to happen. My second point is  and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing  but power is not just shifting vertically  it's also shifting horizontally. You might argue that the story  the history of civilizations  has been civilizations gathered around seas    with the first ones around the Mediterranean  the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic. Well it seems to me that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power  broadly speaking  away from nations gathered around the Atlantic  seaboard  to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim. Now that begins with economic power  but that's the way it always begins. You already begin to see the development of foreign policies  the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world. I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East  something different is happening. My guess is  for what it's worth  is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next    years      but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered  it has radically changed. We are coming out of    years  most unusual years  of history in which we have had a totally mono polar world  in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington    a world bestrode by a single colossus. But that's not a usual case in history. In fact  what's now emerging is the much more normal case of history. You're beginning to see the emergence of a multi polar world. Up until now  the United States has been the dominant feature of our world. They will remain the most powerful nation  but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi polar world. And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up    in China  of course  though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth. It's going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy. But that's a subject of a different discussion. You see India  you see Brazil. You see increasingly that the world now looks actually  for us Europeans  much more like Europe in the   th century. Europe in the   th century  a great British foreign secretary  Lord Canning  used to describe it as the  European concert of powers.  There was a balance  a five sided balance. Britain always played to the balance. If Paris got together with Berlin  Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance. Now notice  in a period which is dominated by a mono polar world  you have fixed alliances    NATO  the Warsaw Pact. A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances. But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances. And that's the world we're coming into  in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed. Canning  the great British foreign secretary once said   Britain has a common interest  but no common allies.  And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out  have to reach out  beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world. Note  that when we went into Libya  it was not good enough for the West to do it alone  we had to bring others in. We had to bring  in this case  the Arab League in. My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves  and we haven't succeeded. My guess is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of     years    I say     years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire    of the hegemony of Western power  Western institutions and Western values. You know  up until now  if the West got its act together  it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world. But that's no longer true. Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War. The West got together    the Bretton Woods Institution  World Bank  International Monetary Fund    the problem solved. Now we have to call in others. Now we have to create the G  . Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our Western friends. Let me make a prediction for you  which is probably even more startling. I suspect we are now reaching the end of     years when Western power was enough. People say to me   The Chinese  of course  they'll never get themselves involved in peace making  multilateral peace making around the world.  Oh yes  Why not  How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret  serving under the blue flag  serving under the U.N. command in the world today       . How many Americans    . What is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of Somali pirates  The Chinese naval contingent. Of course they are  they are a mercantilist nation. They want to keep the sea lanes open. Increasingly  we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values  but with whom  for the moment  we share common interests. It's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging. And here's the third factor  which is totally different. Today in our modern world  because of the Internet  because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here  everything is connected to everything. We are now interdependent. We are now interlocked  as nations  as individuals  in a way which has never been the case before  never been the case before. The interrelationship of nations  well it's always existed. Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations. But now we are intimately locked together. You get swine flu in Mexico  it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport    hours later. Lehman Brothers goes down  the whole lot collapses. There are fires in the steppes of Russia  food riots in Africa. We are all now deeply  deeply  deeply interconnected. And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone  not connected with others  not working with others  is no longer a viable proposition. Because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself  nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory  because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them. I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain. At that time  the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only  how strong was our army  how strong was our air force  how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies. That was when the enemy was outside the walls. Now the enemy is inside the walls. Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country  I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security  I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security  I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies    as we see from cyber warfare    I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country  who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country    as we in London saw in the     bombings. It's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense. It's its capacity to lock together its institutions. And this tells you something very important. It tells you that  in fact  our governments  vertically constructed  constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution    vertical hierarchy  specialization of tasks  command structures    have got the wrong structures completely. You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time  ladies and gentlemen  is the network. It's your capacity to network that matters  both within your governments and externally. So here is Ashdown's third law. By the way  don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet  it always sounds better if there's a third law  doesn't it  Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age  where everything is connected to everything  the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others. The most important bit about your structure    whether you're a government  whether you're an army regiment  whether you're a business    is your docking points  your interconnectors  your capacity to network with others. You understand that in industry  governments don't. But now one final thing. If it is the case  ladies and gentlemen    and it is    that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before  then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other. Suddenly and for the very first time  collective defense  the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations  is no longer enough. It used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe  I was safe  if my country was more powerful than their country  I was safe  my alliance  like NATO  was more powerful than their alliance  I was safe. It is no longer the case. The advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that  increasingly  I share a destiny with my enemy. When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the     s  we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them. Collective security is not enough. Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero sum game couldn't work. They shared a destiny with their enemies. One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides  both Israel and  I think  the Palestinians  do not understand that they share a collective destiny. And so suddenly  ladies and gentlemen  what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy. I started with a poem  I'll end with one. The great poem of John Donne's.  Send not for whom the bell tolls.  The poem is called  No Man is an Island.  And it goes   Every man's death affected me  for I am involved in mankind  send not to ask for whom the bell tolls  it tolls for thee.  For John Donne  a recommendation of morality. For us  I think  part of the equation for our survival. Thank you very much. There's currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website. And I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic    except for me. I don't agree with this. I think we have a situation here. Because if you think about it        TEDTalks  that's over       ideas worth spreading. How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas  Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos  it would actually currently take you over     hours to do so. And I did a little calculation of this. The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around        . So having seen this danger to the economy  I thought  we need to find a solution to this problem. Here's my approach to it all. If you look at the current situation  you have a thousand TEDTalks. Each of those TEDTalks has an average length of about       words. Now take this together and you end up with  .  million words of TEDTalks  which is about three Bibles worth of content. The obvious question here is  does a TEDTalk really need       words  Isn't there something shorter  I mean  if you have an idea worth spreading  surely you can put it into something shorter than       words. The only question is  how short can you get  What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TEDTalk  While I was pondering this question  I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway  who allegedly said that these six words here   For sale  baby shoes  never worn   were the best novel he had ever written. And I also encountered a project called Six Word Memoirs where people were asked  take your whole life and please sum this up into six words  such as these here   Found true love  married someone else.  Or  Living in existential vacuum  it sucks.  I actually like that one. So if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words  you don't need more than six words for a TEDTalk. We could have been done by lunch here. I mean ... And if you did this for all thousand TEDTalks  you would get from  .  million words down to      . So I thought this was quite worthwhile. So I started asking all my friends  please take your favorite TEDTalk and put that into six words. So here are some of the results that I received. I think they're quite nice. For example  Dan Pink's talk on motivation  which was pretty good if you haven't seen it   Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning.  It's what he's basically talking about in those    and a half minutes. Or some even included references to the speakers  such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style  or the one of Tim Ferriss  which might be considered a bit strenuous at times. The challenge here is  if I try to systematically do this  I would probably end up with a lot of summaries  but not with many friends in the end. So I had to find a different method  preferably involving total strangers. And luckily there's a website for that called Mechanical Turk  which is a website where you can post tasks that you don't want to do yourself  such as  Please summarize this text for me in six words.  And I didn't allow any low cost countries to work on this  but I found out I could get a six word summary for just    cents  which I think is a pretty good price. Even then  unfortunately  it's not possible to summarize each TEDTalk individually. Because if you do the math  you have a thousand TEDTalks  the pay    cents each  you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks  because some of them will probably be  or are  really bad. So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars. So I thought of a different way by thinking  well  the talks revolve around certain themes. So what if I don't let people summarize individual TEDTalks to six words  but give them    TEDTalks at the same time and say   Please do a six word summary for that one.  I would cut my costs by    percent. So for      I could summarize a thousand TEDTalks into just     summaries  which would actually be quite nice. Now some of you might actually right now be thinking  It's downright crazy to have    TEDTalks summarized into just six words. But it's actually not  because there's an example by statistics professor  Hans Rosling. I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks. He's got eight talks online  and those talks can basically be summed up into just four words  because that's all he's basically showing us  our intuition is really bad. He always proves us wrong. So people on the Internet  some didn't do so well. I mean  when I asked them to summarize the    TEDTalks at the same time  some took the easy route out. They just had some general comment. There were others  and I found this quite cheeky. They used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately. And finally also  I never understood this  some people really came up with their own version of the truth. I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this. But  oh well. In the end  however  and this is really amazing  for each of those    TEDTalk clusters that I submitted  I actually received meaningful summaries. Here are some of my favorites. For example  for all the TEDTalks around food  someone summed this up into   Food shaping body  brains and environment   which I think is pretty good. Or happiness   Striving toward happiness   moving toward unhappiness.  So here I was. I had started out with a thousand TEDTalks and I had     six word summaries for those. Actually it sounded nice in the beginning  but when you look at     summaries  it's quite a lot. It's a huge list. So I thought  I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries    and this is exactly what I did. So I took the     summaries that I had  put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com and asked people to do summaries of those. Again  there were some misunderstandings. For example  when I had a cluster of all the beautiful talks  someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick up line. But in the end  amazingly  again  people were able to do it. For example  all the courageous TEDTalks   People dying   or  People suffering   was also one   with easy solutions around.  Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw dropping TEDTalk   Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer.  I mean that's the essence of it all. Now I had my nine groups  but  I mean  it's already quite a reduction. But of course  once you are that far  you're not really satisfied. I wanted to go all the way  all the way down the distillery  starting out with a thousand TEDTalks. I wanted to have a thousand TEDTalks summarized into just six words    which would be a   .     percent reduction in content. And I would only pay    .      so stay even below a hundred dollars for it. So I had    overall summaries done. This time I paid    cents because I thought the task was a bit harder. And unfortunately when I first received the answers    and here you'll see six of the answers    I was a bit disappointed. Because I think you'll agree  they all summarize some aspect of TED  but to me they felt a bit bland  or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them. So I was almost ready to give up when one night I played around with these sentences and found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here. So here it is  a crowd sourced  six word summary of a thousand TEDTalks at the value of    .     Why the worry  I'd rather wonder.  Thank you very much. Lauren Hodge  If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option  which would you choose  grilled or fried chicken  Now most people would answer grilled  and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories. However  grilled chicken poses a hidden danger. The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines    specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine  or PhIP    which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound. A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells  which can also cause them to metastasize or spread. They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group. Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines. However  no studies exist yet that show how or why. These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens. And as you can see  none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe  which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet. Now you might wonder how a    year old girl could come up with this idea. And I was led to it through a series of events. I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office    which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants. They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken  but they were sued because of California's Proposition     which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning. So I was very surprised about this. And I was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken  which doesn't seem very harmful. But then one night  my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner  and I noticed that the edges of the chicken  which had been marinated in lemon juice  turned white. And later in biology class  I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing  which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function. So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis  saying that  could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH  So my idea was born  and I had the project set up and a hypothesis  so what was my next step  Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school. I thought this would be easy  but I emailed about     different people within a five hour radius of where I lived  and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me. Most of the others either never responded back  said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me. So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times. However  it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab    so I could finally start my project. The first stage was completed at home  which consisted of marinating the chicken  grilling the chicken  amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab. The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab  which is where I extracted the chemicals  changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken. The final stages  when I ran the samples through a high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer  which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken. So when I went through the data  I had very surprising results  because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation. When compared with the unmarinated chicken  which is what I used as my control  I found that lemon juice worked by far the best  which decreased the carcinogens by about    percent. The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well  decreasing the carcinogens by about    percent. Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation  but it was nearly negligible. And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range  but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens. Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially was the time cooked. And I found that if you increase the time cooked  the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases. So the best way to marinate chicken  based on this  is to  not under cook  but definitely don't over cook and char the chicken  and marinate in either lemon juice  brown sugar or saltwater. Based on these findings  I have a question for you. Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life  Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated  you're definitely going to catch cancer and die. However  anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle. Is it worth it to you  How will you cook your chicken now  Shree Bose  Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose. I was the       year old age category winner and then the grand prize winner. And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant. And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they're different colors. Sounds ridiculous  right. But that was me years ago. And that was my first science fair project. It got a bit more complicated from there. My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra. My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects  including a remote controlled garbage can. And then came the summer after my freshman year  when my grandfather passed away due to cancer. And I remember watching my family go through that and thinking that I never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss. So  armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology  I decided I wanted to do cancer research at   . Good plan. So I started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab. Got rejected by all except one. And then went on  my next summer  to work under Dr. Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth  Texas. And that is where the research began. So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about  or at least don't pay that much attention to. But yet  it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. In fact  one in    women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. One in     will die from it. Chemotherapy  one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today  involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells. Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug    a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves. Sounds great  right  But here's the problem  sometimes patients become resistant to the drug  and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free  they come back. And this time  they no longer respond to the drug. It's a huge problem. In fact  it's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today. So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin. And we wanted to figure this out  because if we could figure that out  then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening. So that's what we set out to do. And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase  an energy protein. So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein  and we saw this huge shift. I mean  on the slide  you can see that on our sensitive side  these cells that are responding to the drug  when we start blocking the protein  the number of dying cells    those colored dots    they're going down. But then on this side  with the same treatment  they're going up    interesting. But those are dots on a screen for you  what exactly does that mean  Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell. And in fact  it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant. And that's huge. In fact  it means that if a patient comes in and they're resistant to this drug  then if we give them a chemical to block this protein  then we can treat them again with the same drug. And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness    possibly for many different types of cancer. So that was my work  and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research  with figuring out exactly what this protein does  but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness    so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren. But my work wasn't just about the research. It was about finding my passion. That's why being the grand prize winner of the Google Global Science Fair    cute picture  right    it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor. And ever since then  I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff    from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys. But like I said  my journey wasn't just about the research  it was about finding my passion  and it was about making my own opportunities when I didn't even know what I was doing. It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing. After all  my story begins with a dried  withered spinach plant and it's only getting better from there. Thank you. Naomi Shah  Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah  and today I'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients.  .  million deaths worldwide. One death every    seconds. People spend over    percent of their lives indoors. And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined. Now these statistics had a huge impact on me  but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year round. It confused me  why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season  With this question in mind  I started researching  and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit. As soon as I realized this  I investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients. At first  I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients. But soon after  I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients. And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health  because that relationship seems so important. So with that in mind  I started researching more  I started investigating more  and I became very passionate. Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation  we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively. For example  volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools  homes and workplaces. They're everywhere. These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant  as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act. Which is surprising to me  because these chemical pollutants  through my research  I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated. So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created. I'm going to show it to you on my laptop. And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today  Julie. And all of Julie's data has been pre entered into my interactive software model. And this can be used by anyone. So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes  or someone who's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder. So Julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma. And the doctor has her sit down  and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate    which is essentially her exhalation rate  or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath. So that peak expiratory flow rate  I've entered it up into the interactive software model. I've also entered in her age  her gender and her height. I've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels. So any user can come in here and click on  lung function report  and it'll take them to this report that I created. And this report really drives home the crux of my research. So what it shows    if you want to focus on that top graph in the right hand corner    it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar. This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office. In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph  it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate  what her exhalation rate or lung health  should be based on her age  gender and height. So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar  and he says   Wow  we need to give her steroids  medication and inhalers.  But I want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids  inhalers and medication  the doctor turns to Julie and says   Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters. Clean out the air ducts in your home  in your workplace  in your school. Stop the use of incense and candles. And if you're remodeling your house  take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring.  Because these solutions are natural  these solutions are sustainable  and these solutions are long term investments    long term investments that we're making for our generation and for future generations. Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home  her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her. So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma  more respiratory disorders  as well as more pollutants. But before I end my talk today  I want to leave you with one saying. And that saying is that genetics loads the gun  but the environment pulls the trigger. And that made a huge impact on me when I was doing this research. Because what I feel  is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level  that we can't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything. But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home  in our own school and in our own workplace  we can make a huge difference in air quality. Because remember  we spend    percent of our lives indoors. And air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients  anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general. So I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality  better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations. Thank you. Lisa Ling  Right. Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly  Your Google Science Fair champions. Your winners. Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today    we think of financial and economic primarily    the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue    our ability to address modern conflicts as they are  to go to the source of what they're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them. We who are diplomats  we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states. And I can tell you  our agenda is full. There is trade  there is disarmament  there is cross border relations. But the picture is changing  and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene. We loosely call them  groups.  They may represent social  religious  political  economic  military realities. And we struggle with how to deal with them. The rules of engagement  how to talk  when to talk  and how to deal with them. Let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since      until today. You see the green is a traditional interstate conflict  the ones we used to read about. The red is modern conflict  conflicts within states. These are quite different  and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy. And the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries. And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries. So in a way  it is everybody's business. Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years  recent years  is that very few of these domestic interstate  intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily. They may have to be dealt with with military means  but they cannot be solved by military means. They need political solutions. And we  therefore  have a problem  because they escape traditional diplomacy. And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them. Plus  during the last decade  we've been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous. After       either you were with us or against us. It was black or white. And groups are very often immediately label terrorists. And who would talk to terrorists  The West  as I would see it  comes out of that decade weakened  because we didn't understand the group. So we've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others. Now I'm not naive. You cannot talk to everybody all the time. And there are times you should walk. And sometimes military intervention is necessary. I happen to believe that Libya was necessary and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary. And my country relies on its security through military alliance  that's clear. But still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict. Let us turn to Afghanistan.    years after that military intervention  that country is far from secure. The situation  to be honest  is very serious. Now again  the military is necessary  but the military is no problem solver. When I first came to Afghanistan in      as a foreign minister  I met the commander of ISAF  the international troops. And he told me that   This can be won militarily  minister. We just have to persevere.  Now four COM ISAF's later  we hear a different message   This cannot be won militarily. We need military presence  but we need to move to politics. We can only solve this through a political solution. And it is not us who will solve it  Afghans have to solve it.  But then they need a different political process than the one they were given in           . They need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues. Everybody seems to agree with that. It was very controversial to say three  four  five years ago. Now everybody agrees. But now  as we prepare to talk  we understand how little we know. Because we didn't talk. We didn't grasp what was going on. The International Committee of the Red Cross  the ICRC  is talking to everyone  and it is doing so because it is neutral. And that's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict    because they talk. My point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk. And you don't have to agree when you sit down with the other side. And you can always walk. But if you don't talk  you can't engage the other side. And the other side which you're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree. Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process   You don't make peace with your friends  you make peace with your enemies.  It's hard  but it is necessary. Let me go one step further. This is Tahrir Square. There's a revolution going on. The Arab Spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter. It will last for a long  long time. And who knows what it will be called in the end. That's not the point. The point is that we are probably seeing  for the first time in the history of the Arab world  a revolution bottom up    people's revolution. Social groups are taking to the streets. And we find out in the West that we know very little about what's happening. Because we never talk to the people in these countries. Most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups  because they were terrorists. So now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution  we find out how little we know. Right now  the discussion goes   Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood  Should we talk to Hamas  If we talk to them  we may legitimize them.  I think that is wrong. If you talk in the right way  you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing. And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood  as we should  that they must respect minority rights  if we don't accept majority rights  Because they may turn out to be a majority. How can we escape  having  a double standard  if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don't want to deal with the groups that are representative  How will we ever be interlocutors  Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups. But talking can be done in different ways. We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level. Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid. Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion. There's a big array of the ways of dealing with this. So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come  we will further radicalization  I believe. We will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel. And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy  if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states  there are some rewards on the other side. The paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this. And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising    and for one reason primarily. And the reason is what happened in South Africa  Nelson Mandela. When Mandela came out of prison after    years of captivity  if he had told his people   It's time to take up the arms  it's time to fight   he would have been followed. And I think the international community would have said   Fair enough. It's their right to fight.  Now as you know  Mandela didn't do that. In his memoirs   Long Road to Freedom   he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being  also being a human being. So he engaged a political process of dialogue  not as a strategy of the weak  but as a strategy of the strong. And he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked. Now South African friends will know that was very painful. So what can we learn from all of this  Dialogue is not easy    not between individuals  not between groups  not between governments    but it is very necessary. If we're going to deal with political conflict solving of conflicts  if we're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom up  supported by technology  which is available to all  we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations. We have to connect with these profound changes. And what is dialogue really about  When I enter into dialogue  I really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view  that I would impress upon them my opinions and my values. I cannot do that unless I send the signals that I will be open to listen to the other side's signals. We need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem solving forward. We know from our personal experiences that it's easy sometimes just to walk  and sometimes you may need to fight. And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances. Sometimes you have to. But that strategy seldom takes you very far. The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue. And I believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy  not only between states  but also within states. We are seeing some new signs. We could never have done the convention against anti personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently  by engaging with civil society. All of a sudden  NGOs were not only standing in the streets  crying their slogans  but they were taking  them  into the negotiations  partly because they represented the victims of these weapons. And they brought their knowledge. And there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom up. This is perhaps a first element of a change. In the future  I believe  we should draw examples from these different illustrations  not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society. And we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times  climate change. How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations  unless we are able to make civil society and people  not part of the problem  but part of the solution  It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations  but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization. It's crucial to understand  I believe  because of technology and because of globalization  societies from bottom up. We as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities. What is it that makes people trust each other  not only between states  but also within states  What is the legitimacy of diplomacy  of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups  The good thing is that we are not powerless. We have never had as many means of communication  means of being connected  means of reaching out  means of including. The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication. But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it. Now  I hope  in the coming years  that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem solving  among the Afghans  inside the Palestinian population  between the peoples of Palestine and Israel. And as we try to understand this broad movement across the Arab world  we are not powerless. We need to improve the necessary skills  and we need the courage to use them. In my country  I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together  not as a government initiative  but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low key tension. And when tension increased  they already had that dialogue  and that was a strength to deal with different issues. Our modern Western societies are more complex than before  in this time of migration. How are we going to settle and build a bigger  We  to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication  So there are many reasons  and for all of these reasons  this is time and this is why we must talk. Thank you for your attention. What I'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body. Now molecules are really  really tiny. And by tiny  I mean really. They're smaller than a wavelength of light  so we have no way to directly observe them. But through science  we do have a fairly good idea of what's going on down at the molecular scale. So what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules  but we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules. One way around this is to draw pictures. And this idea is actually nothing new. Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process. They draw pictures of what they're observing with their eyes  through technology like telescopes and microscopes  and also what they're thinking about in their minds. I picked two well known examples  because they're very well known for expressing science through art. And I start with Galileo who used the world's first telescope to look at the Moon. And he transformed our understanding of the Moon. The perception in the   th century was the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere. But what Galileo saw was a rocky  barren world  which he expressed through his watercolor painting. Another scientist with very big ideas  the superstar of biology  is Charles Darwin. And with this famous entry in his notebook  he begins in the top left hand corner with   I think   and then sketches out the first tree of life  which is his perception of how all the species  all living things on Earth  are connected through evolutionary history    the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population. Even as a scientist  I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible  with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work  until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell  who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute. And his pictures  everything's accurate and it's all to scale. And his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like. So this is a transection through blood. In the top left hand corner  you've got this yellow green area. The yellow green area is the fluids of blood  which is mostly water  but it's also antibodies  sugars  hormones  that kind of thing. And the red region is a slice into a red blood cell. And those red molecules are hemoglobin. They are actually red  that's what gives blood its color. And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body. I was very much inspired by this image many years ago  and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world. What would it look like  And that's how I really began. So let's begin. This is DNA in its classic double helix form. And it's from X ray crystallography  so it's an accurate model of DNA. If we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands  you see these things that look like teeth. Those are the letters of genetic code  the        genes you've got written in your DNA. This is what they typically talk about    the genetic code    this is what they're talking about. But I want to talk about a different aspect of DNA science  and that is the physical nature of DNA. It's these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can't go into right now. But they physically run in opposite directions  which creates a number of complications for your living cells  as you're about to see  most particularly when DNA is being copied. And so what I'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body  at least      biology. So DNA's entering the production line from the left hand side  and it hits this collection  these miniature biochemical machines  that are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy. So DNA comes in and hits this blue  doughnut shaped structure and it's ripped apart into its two strands. One strand can be copied directly  and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there. But things aren't so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards. So it's thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time  creating two new DNA molecules. Now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you  copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity. It's an accurate representation  and it's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you. I've left out error correction and a bunch of other things. This was work from a number of years ago. Thank you. This is work from a number of years ago  but what I'll show you next is updated science  it's updated technology. So again  we begin with DNA. And it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules  which I've stripped away so you can see something. DNA is about two nanometers across  which is really quite tiny. But in each one of your cells  each strand of DNA is about    to    million nanometers long. So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code  it's wrapped around these purple proteins    or I've labeled them purple here. It's packaged up and bundled up. All this field of view is a single strand of DNA. This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome. And we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute. We're pulling out  we're zooming out  out through a nuclear pore  which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the DNA called the nucleus. All of this field of view is about a semester's worth of biology  and I've got seven minutes. So we're not going to be able to do that today  No  I'm being told   No.  This is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope. And it's been filmed under time lapse  which is why you can see it moving. The nuclear envelope breaks down. These sausage shaped things are the chromosomes  and we'll focus on them. They go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots. When the cell feels it's ready to go  it rips apart the chromosome. One set of DNA goes to one side  the other side gets the other set of DNA    identical copies of DNA. And then the cell splits down the middle. And again  you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you. Now we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it. So again  here we are at that equator moment. The chromosomes line up. And if we isolate just one chromosome  we're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure. So this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have  at least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us. So this is a single chromosome. And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome. One is bundled up into one sausage. The other strand is bundled up into the other sausage. These things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell. They're called mircrotubules. That name's not important. But what we're going to focus on is this red region    I've labeled it red here    and it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes. It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes. We have no idea really as to how it's achieving that movement. We've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study  and we're still just beginning to discover what it's all about. It is made up of about     different types of proteins  thousands of proteins in total. It is a signal broadcasting system. It broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it's ready  when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes. It is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules. It's involved with the growing of the microtubules  and it's able to transiently couple onto them. It's also an attention sensing system. It's able to feel when the cell is ready  when the chromosome is correctly positioned. It's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right. And you'll see  there's this one little last bit that's still remaining red. And it's walked away down the microtubules. That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal. And it's walked away. I mean  it's that mechanical. It's molecular clockwork. This is how you work at the molecular scale. So with a little bit of molecular eye candy  we've got kinesins  which are the orange ones. They're little molecular courier molecules walking one way. And here are the dynein. They're carrying that broadcasting system. And they've got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on. So again  this is all derived accurately from the science. The problem is we can't show it to you any other way. Exploring at the frontier of science  at the frontier of human understanding  is mind blowing. Discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science. But most medical researchers    discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals  which are to eradicate disease  to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty. Thank you. Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over    years last October. There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get. And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most. We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage  but we still can't do that with water  and here's why. Right now  if you want to test water in the field  you need a trained technician  expensive equipment like this  and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results. It's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change  too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing. And it ignores the fact that  in the meanwhile  people still need to drink water. Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn't come from testing water  it came from forms like this  which documented all the people we failed to help. Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines    a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they're safe. I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known. We think there's a simpler solution to this problem    one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday. It's in its early stages  but this is what it looks like right now. We call it the Water Canary. It's a fast  cheap device that answers an important question  Is this water contaminated  It doesn't require any special training. And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place  it uses light. That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place  no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information. To test water  you simply insert a sample and  within seconds  it either displays a red light  indicating contaminated water  or a green light  indicating the sample is safe. This will make it possible for anyone to collect life saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold. We're also  on top of that  integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM. What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time. With enough users  maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action  containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from. And then  instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most  it can happen automatically. We've seen how distributed networks  big data and information can transform society. I think it's time for us to apply them to water. Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field and to open source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation  so we can tackle this problem together. Thank you. One of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don't    into the religious and the atheists. And for the last decade or so  it's been quite clear what being an atheist means. There have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out  not just that religion is wrong  but that it's ridiculous. These people  many of whom have lived in North Oxford  have argued    they've argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game. Now I think it's too easy. I think it's too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way. And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. And what I'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist    if you like  a new version of atheism we could call Atheism  . . Now what is Atheism  .   Well it starts from a very basic premise  of course  there's no God. Of course  there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels  etc. Now let's move on  that's not the end of the story  that's the very  very beginning. I'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines  that thinks   I can't believe in any of this stuff. I can't believe in the doctrines. I don't think these doctrines are right. But   a very important but   I love Christmas carols. I really like the art of Mantegna. I really like looking at old churches. I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament.  Whatever it may be  you know the kind of thing I'm talking about    people who are attracted to the ritualistic side  the moralistic  communal side of religion  but can't bear the doctrine. Until now  these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice. It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff  or you reject the doctrine and you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of CNN and Walmart. So that's a sort of tough choice. I don't think we have to make that choice. I think there is an alternative. I think there are ways    and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious    of stealing from religions. If you don't believe in a religion  there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing  with taking out the best sides of religion. And for me  atheism  .  is about both  as I say  a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying   What here could we use   The secular world is full of holes. We have secularized badly  I would argue. And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well. And I'd like to run through a few of these today. I'd like to kick off by looking at education. Now education is a field the secular world really believes in. When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place  we think education  that's where we put a lot of money. Education is going to give us  not only commercial skills  industrial skills  it's also going to make us better people. You know the kind of thing a commencement address is  and graduation ceremonies  those lyrical claims that education  the process of education    particularly higher education    will make us into nobler and better human beings. That's a lovely idea. Interesting where it came from. In the early   th century  church attendance in Western Europe started sliding down very  very sharply  and people panicked. They asked themselves the following question. They said  where are people going to find the morality  where are they going to find guidance  and where are they going to find sources of consolation  And influential voices came up with one answer. They said culture. It's to culture that we should look for guidance  for consolation  for morality. Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare  the dialogues of Plato  the novels of Jane Austen. In there  we'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John. Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea. They wanted to replace scripture with culture. And that's a very plausible idea. It's also an idea that we have forgotten. If you went to a top university    let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge    and you said   I've come here because I'm in search of morality  guidance and consolation  I want to know how to live   they would show you the way to the insane asylum. This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of. Why  They don't think we need it. They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance. They see us as adults  rational adults. What we need is information. We need data  we don't need help. Now religions start from a very different place indeed. All religions  all major religions  at various points call us children. And like children  they believe that we are in severe need of assistance. We're only just holding it together. Perhaps this is just me  maybe you. But anyway  we're only just holding it together. And we need help. Of course  we need help. And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning. You know  in the   th century in the U.K.  the greatest preacher  greatest religious preacher  was a man called John Wesley  who went up and down this country delivering sermons  advising people how they could live. He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents  the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich. He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons  the classic medium of delivery of religions. Now we've given up with the idea of sermons. If you said to a modern liberal individualist   Hey  how about a sermon   they'd go   No  no. I don't need one of those. I'm an independent  individual person.  What's the difference between a sermon and our modern  secular mode of delivery  the lecture  Well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information. And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition. The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable  because we are in need of guidance  morality and consolation    and religions know that. Another point about education  we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once  they'll remember it. Sit them in a classroom  tell them about Plato at the age of     send them out for a career in management consultancy for    years  and that lesson will stick with them. Religions go   Nonsense. You need to keep repeating the lesson    times a day. So get on your knees and repeat it.  That's what all religions tell us   Get on you knees and repeat it    or    or    times a day.  Otherwise our minds are like sieves. So religions are cultures of repetition. They circle the great truths again and again and again. We associate repetition with boredom.  Give us the new   we're always saying.  The new is better than the old.  If I said to you   Okay  we're not going to have new TED. We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true. We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times because what she says is so clever   you'd feel cheated. Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset. The other things that religions do is to arrange time. All the major religions give us calendars. What is a calendar  A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas. In the Catholic chronology  Catholic calendar  at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor. You won't do that by accident  you will do that because you are guided to do that. Now we don't think that way. In the secular world we think   If an idea is important  I'll bump into it. I'll just come across it.  Nonsense  says the religious world view. Religious view says we need calendars  we need to structure time  we need to synchronize encounters. This comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings. Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon. You know  when you look at the Moon  you think   I'm really small. What are my problems   It sets things into perspective  etc.  etc. We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't. Why don't we  Well there's nothing to tell us   Look at the Moon.  But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September  you will be ordered out of your home  made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi  where you will be given poems to read in honor of the Moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of. You'll be handed rice cakes. And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart. That's very good. The other thing that religions are really aware of is  speak well    I'm not doing a very good job of this here    but oratory  oratory is absolutely key to religions. In the secular world  you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career. But the religious world doesn't think that way. What you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it. So if you go to an African American Pentecostalist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk  my goodness  they talk well. After every convincing point  people will go   Amen  amen  amen.  At the end of a really rousing paragraph  they'll all stand up  and they'll go   Thank you Jesus  thank you Christ  thank you Savior.  If we were doing it like they do it    let's not do it  but if we were to do it    I would tell you something like   Culture should replace scripture.  And you would go   Amen  amen  amen.  And at the end of my talk  you would all stand up and you would go   Thank you Plato  thank you Shakespeare  thank you Jane Austen.  And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going. All right  all right. We're getting there. We're getting there. The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains  we are also bodies. And when they teach us a lesson  they do it via the body. So for example  take the Jewish idea of forgiveness. Jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh. They don't just deliver us sermons on this. They don't just give us books or words about this. They tell us to have a bath. So in Orthodox Jewish communities  every Friday you go to a Mikveh. You immerse yourself in the water  and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea. We don't tend to do that. Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another. Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two. Let's look at art now. Now art is something that in the secular world  we think very highly of. We think art is really  really important. A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums  etc. We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals  or our new churches. You've heard that saying. Now I think that the potential is there  but we've completely let ourselves down. And the reason we've let ourselves down is that we're not properly studying how religions handle art. The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art  The first idea is that art should be for art's sake    a ridiculous idea    an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world. I couldn't disagree more. The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself  that artists shouldn't say what they're up to  because if they said it  it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy. That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum    let's admit it    is   I don't know what this is about.  But if we're serious people  we don't admit to that. But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art. Now religions have a much saner attitude to art. They have no trouble telling us what art is about. Art is about two things in all the major faiths. Firstly  it's trying to remind you of what there is to love. And secondly  it's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate. And that's what art is. Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith. So as you walk around a church  or a mosque or a cathedral  what you're trying to imbibe  what you're imbibing is  through your eyes  through your senses  truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind. Essentially it's propaganda. Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view. Now the word  propaganda  sets off alarm bells. We think of Hitler  we think of Stalin. Don't  necessarily. Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something. And if that thing is good  there's no problem with it at all. My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions. And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum    if I was a museum curator  I would make a room for love  a room for generosity. All works of art are talking to us about things. And if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told  use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind  we would get a lot more out of art. Art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we've neglected because of certain mis founded ideas. Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society. Art should be didactic. Let's think of something else. The people in the modern world  in the secular world  who are interested in matters of the spirit  in matters of the mind  in higher soul like concerns  tend to be isolated individuals. They're poets  they're philosophers  they're photographers  they're filmmakers. And they tend to be on their own. They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable  single people. And they get depressed and they get sad on their own. And they don't really change much. Now think about religions  think about organized religions. What do organized religions do  They group together  they form institutions. And that has all sorts of advantages. First of all  scale  might. The Catholic Church pulled in    billion dollars last year according to the Wall Street Journal. These are massive machines. They're collaborative  they're branded  they're multinational  and they're highly disciplined. These are all very good qualities. We recognize them in relation to corporations. And corporations are very like religions in many ways  except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs. They're selling us shoes and cars. Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff    the therapists  the poets    are on their own and they have no power  they have no might. So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind. Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us  but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it. Books alone  books written by lone individuals  are not going to change anything. We need to group together. If you want to change the world  you have to group together  you have to be collaborative. And that's what religions do. They are multinational  as I say  they are branded  they have a clear identity  so they don't get lost in a busy world. That's something we can learn from. I want to conclude. Really what I want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields  there is something to learn from the example of religion    even if you don't believe any of it. If you're involved in anything that's communal  that involves lots of people getting together  there are things for you in religion. If you're involved  say  in a travel industry in any way  look at pilgrimage. Look very closely at pilgrimage. We haven't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel. If you're in the art world  look at the example of what religions are doing with art. And if you're an educator in any way  again  look at how religions are spreading ideas. You may not agree with the ideas  but my goodness  they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so. So really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion  but at the end of the day  religions are so subtle  so complicated  so intelligent in many ways that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone  they're for all of us. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Now this is actually a courageous talk  because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters. AB  You can get shot by both sides. You can get shot by the hard headed atheists  and you can get shot by those who fully believe. CA  Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment. AB  Indeed. CA  But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from  which is this sense    that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious    of spiritual experience  of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are. Is there any room for that experience in Atheism  .   AB  Absolutely. I  like many of you  meet people who say things like   But isn't there something bigger than us  something else   And I say   Of course.  And they say   So aren't you sort of religious   And I go   No.  Why does that sense of mystery  that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe  need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling  Science and just observation gives us that feeling without it  so I don't feel the need. The universe is large and we are tiny  without the need for further religious superstructure. So one can have so called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit. CA  Actually  let me just ask a question. How many people here would say that religion is important to them  Is there an equivalent process by which there's a sort of bridge between what you're talking about and what you would say to them  AB  I would say that there are many  many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged. It's not as though  as I try to suggest  it's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things  or you don't have religion and then you're cut off from all these very good things. It's so sad that we constantly say   I don't believe so I can't have community  so I'm cut off from morality  so I can't go on a pilgrimage.  One wants to say   Nonsense. Why not   And that's really the spirit of my talk. There's so much we can absorb. Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion. CA  It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community who are atheists. But probably most people in the community certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common. Are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where  instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war  that there could be bridging  AB  No  we need to be polite about differences. Politeness is a much overlooked virtue. It's seen as hypocrisy. But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist and someone says   Well you know  I did pray the other day   you politely ignore it. You move on. Because you've agreed on    percent of things  because you have a shared view on so many things  and you politely differ. And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored. They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement. CA  And finally  does this new thing that you're proposing that's not a religion but something else  does it need a leader  and are you volunteering to be the pope  AB  Well  one thing that we're all very suspicious of is individual leaders. It doesn't need it. What I've tried to lay out is a framework and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in. I've sketched a sort of broad framework. But wherever you are  as I say  if you're in the travel industry  do that travel bit. If you're in the communal industry  look at religion and do the communal bit. So it's a wiki project. CA  Alain  thank you for sparking many conversations later. In the     s in the communist Eastern Germany  if you owned a typewriter  you had to register it with the government. You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter. And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from. If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought  they could track down who created that thought. And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody could do this  how much this would restrict freedom of speech. We would never do that in our own countries. But today in       if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page  that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer. This is happening to us today. And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it. And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us  the citizens. And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today. If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world  we can group the attacks based on the attackers. We have three main groups. We have online criminals. Like here  we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine. And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand. These guys make money. They use online attacks to make lots of money  and lots and lots of it. We actually have several cases of millionaires online  multimillionaires  who made money with their attacks. Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia. This is Alfred Gonzalez. This is Stephen Watt. This is Bjorn Sundin. This is Matthew Anderson  Tariq Al Daour and so on and so on. These guys make their fortunes online  but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking  or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer. The U.S. Secret Service  two months ago  froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here  and that bank account had   .  million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen. Mr. Jain himself is on the loose  nobody knows where he is. And I claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world. And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse. In the future  the majority of crime will be happening online. The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money. They're motivated by something else    motivated by protests  motivated by an opinion  motivated by the laughs. Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last    months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks. So those are the three main attackers  criminals who do it for the money  hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest  but then the last group are nation states  governments doing the attacks. And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar. This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens. DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands    or actually  it was. It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into. Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly. And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives  I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack. And his answer was yes. So how do people die as the result of a hack like this  Well DigiNotar is a C.A. They sell certificates. What do you do with certificates  Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https  SSL encrypted services  services like Gmail. Now we all  or a big part of us  use Gmail or one of their competitors  but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran  where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections  so the local government can't snoop on their discussions. Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A. and issue rogue certificates. And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar. What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening  for example  in Egypt  Well in Egypt  the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April       and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers. Among those papers  was this binder entitled  FINFISHER.  And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting    and in very large scale    all the communication of the citizens of the country. They had sold this tool for         Euros to the Egyptian government. The company headquarters are right here. So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens. But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well. For example  in Germany  just a couple of weeks ago the so called State Trojan was found  which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens. If you are a suspect in a criminal case  well it's pretty obvious  your phone will be tapped. But today  it goes beyond that. They will tap your Internet connection. They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan  which enables them to watch all your communication  to listen to your online discussions  to collect your passwords. Now when we think deeper about things like these  the obvious response from people should be that   Okay  that sounds bad  but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen. Why should I worry  Because I have nothing to hide.  And this is an argument  which doesn't make sense. Privacy is implied. Privacy is not up for discussion. This is not a question between privacy against security. It's a question of freedom against control. And while we might trust our governments right now  right here in       any right we give away will be given away for good. And do we trust  do we blindly trust  any future government  a government we might have    years from now  And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next    years. I'm going to start here. This is a hand lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago. The store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar. And kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake. But unfortunately  one of the things kids liked to draw was cartoon characters. They liked to draw the Little Mermaid  they'd like to draw a smurf  they'd like to draw Micky Mouse. But it turns out to be illegal to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse onto a plate of sugar. And it's a copyright violation. And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the College Bakery said   You know what  we're getting out of that business. If you're an amateur  you don't have access to our machine anymore. If you want a printed sugar birthday cake  you have to use one of our prefab images    only for professionals.  So there's two bills in Congress right now. One is called SOPA  the other is called PIPA. SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act. It's from the Senate. PIPA is short for PROTECTIP  which is itself short for Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property    because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands. And what SOPA and PIPA want to do is they want to do this. They want to raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs. Now the way they propose to do this is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright    although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills    and then they want to remove them from the domain name system. They want to take them out of the domain name system. Now the domain name system is the thing that turns human readable names  like Google.com  into the kinds of addresses machines expect      .   .   .   . Now the problem with this model of censorship  of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system  is that it won't work. And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law  but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much. Now the reason it won't work is that you can still type   .   .   .    into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you'll still go to Google. So the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act. Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals  but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects  you have to understand a little bit about the back story. And the back story is this  SOPA and PIPA  as legislation  were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the   th century. The   th century was a great time to be a media company  because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity. If you were making a TV show  it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made  it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same time    which is a very low threshold of competitive difficulty. Which meant that if you fielded average content  you got a third of the U.S. public for free    tens of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn't too terrible. This is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink. But technology moved on  as technology is wont to do. And slowly  slowly  at the end of the   th century  that scarcity started to get eroded    and I don't mean by digital technology  I mean by analog technology. Cassette tapes  video cassette recorders  even the humble Xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business. Because it turned out we're not really couch potatoes. We don't really like to only consume. We do like to consume  but every time one of these new tools came along  it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share. And this freaked the media businesses out    it freaked them out every time. Jack Valenti  who was the head lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America  once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to Jack the Ripper and poor  helpless Hollywood to a woman at home alone. That was the level of rhetoric. And so the media industries begged  insisted  demanded that Congress do something. And Congress did something. By the early   s  Congress passed the law that changed everything. And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act of     . What the Audio Home Recording Act of      said was  look  if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends  that is not a crime. That's okay. Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay. If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them  that's not okay. But this taping business  fine  let it go. And they thought that they clarified the issue  because they'd set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying. But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted. They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full stop. So when the Audio Home Recording Act of      was passed  the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if Congress was acting in their framework  they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment. So they went for plan B. It took them a while to formulate plan B. Plan B appeared in its first full blown form in         something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It was a complicated piece of legislation  a lot of moving parts. But the main thrust of the DMCA was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material    except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material. It would be  as Ed Felton once famously said   Like handing out water that wasn't wet.  Bits are copyable. That's what computers do. That is a side effect of their ordinary operation. So in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits  the DMCA also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices. Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home    no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it    could be broken by the content industries  if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content. And to make sure you didn't realize  or didn't enact their capabilities as general purpose computing devices  they also made it illegal for you to try to reset the copyability of that content. The DMCA marks the moment when the media industries gave up on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical means. Now the DMCA had  and is continuing to have  a lot of complicated effects  but in this one domain  limiting sharing  it has mostly not worked. And the main reason it hasn't worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined. The mixtape  the fanzine  that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now with the Internet. We are in a world where most American citizens over the age of    share things with each other online. We share written things  we share images  we share audio  we share video. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made out of what we've found  and all of it horrifies those industries. So PIPA and SOPA are round two. But where the DMCA was surgical    we want to go down into your computer  we want to go down into your television set  down into your game machine  and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store    PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying  we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content. Now the mechanism  as I said  for doing this  is you need to take out anybody pointing to those IP addresses. You need to take them out of search engines  you need to take them out of online directories  you need to take them out of user lists. And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet are not Google and Yahoo  they're us  we're the people getting policed. Because in the end  the real threat to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA is our ability to share things with one another. So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing is taking a centuries old legal concept  innocent until proven guilty  and reversing it    guilty until proven innocent. You can't share until you show us that you're not sharing something we don't like. Suddenly  the burden of proof for legal versus illegal falls affirmatively on us and on the services that might be offering us any new capabilities. And if it costs even a dime to police a user  that will crush a service with a hundred million users. So this is the Internet they have in mind. Imagine this sign everywhere    except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery  imagine it says YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. Imagine it says TED  because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost. The real effects of SOPA and PIPA are going to be different than the proposed effects. The threat  in fact  is this inversion of the burden of proof  where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we're given the freedom to create  to produce or to share. And the people who provide those capabilities to us    the YouTubes  the Facebooks  the Twitters and TEDs    are in the business of having to police us  or being on the hook for contributory infringement. There's two things you can do to help stop this    a simple thing and a complicated thing  an easy thing and a hard thing. The simple thing  the easy thing  is this  if you're an American citizen  call your representative  call your senator. When you look at the people who co signed on the SOPA bill  people who've co signed on PIPA  what you see is that they have cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media industries. You don't have millions and millions of dollars  but you can call your representatives  and you can remind them that you vote  and you can ask not to be treated like a thief  and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken. And if you're not an American citizen  you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same. Because this seems like a national issue  but it is not. These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet. If they break it  they will break it for everybody. That's the easy thing. That's the simple thing. The hard thing is this  get ready  because more is coming. SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA  which was purposed last year  which did not pass. And all of this goes back to the failure of the DMCA to disallow sharing as a technical means. And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act  which horrified those industries. Because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving that  that turns out to be really inconvenient.  We'd prefer not to do that   says the content industries. And what they want is not to have to do that. They don't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing. They just want the sharing to go away. PIPA and SOPA are not oddities  they're not anomalies  they're not events. They're the next turn of this particular screw  which has been going on    years now. And if we defeat these  as I hope we do  more is coming. Because until we convince Congress that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster  with YouTube  which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies that goes on in democratic societies. That's the way to handle this. In the meantime  the hard thing to do is to be ready. Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA. Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch  just consuming    not producing  not sharing    and we should say   No.  Thank you. Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day  Do you know how many choices you make in typical week  I recently did a survey with over       Americans  and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about    in a typical day. There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week. And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks. And they found that the average CEO engaged in about     tasks in a week. Each task was made up of many  many  many sub choices of course.    percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less. Only about    percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time. Think about your own choices. Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category  How well do you think you're doing at managing those choices  Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have  which is the choice overload problem. I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions. Now as I talk about this problem  I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers. So when I ask you a question  since I'm blind  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. Otherwise  when I ask you a question  and if your answer is yes  I'd like you to clap your hands. So for my first question for you today  Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem  Thank you. So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University  I used to go to this very  very upscale grocery store  at least at that time it was truly upscale. It was a store called Draeger's. Now this store  it was almost like going to an amusement park. They had     different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over     different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water    and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water. I used to love going to this store  but on one occasion I asked myself  well how come you never buy anything  Here's their olive oil aisle. They had over    different kinds of olive oil  including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand year old olive trees. So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager  and I asked the manager   Is this model of offering people all this choice really working   And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday  with cameras ready usually. We decided to do a little experiment  and we picked jam for our experiment. Here's their jam aisle. They had     different kinds of jam. We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store. We there put out six different flavors of jam or    different flavors of jam  and we looked at two things  First  in which case were people more likely to stop  sample some jam  More people stopped when there were     about    percent  than when there were six  about    percent. The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam. Now we see the opposite effect. Of the people who stopped when there were     only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. Of the people who stopped when there were six  well now we saw that    percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. Now if you do the math  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered   . Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us    at least it's good for our waistlines    but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions. We choose not to choose  even when it goes against our best self interests. So now for the topic of today  financial savings. Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman  Emir Kamenica  Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about     plans all in the U.S. And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan  the     k  plan  does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow. And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation. So in these plans  we had about     plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to    different fund offerings. And what we found was that  the more funds offered  indeed  there was less participation rate. So if you look at the extremes  those plans that offered you two funds  participation rates were around in the mid   s    still not as high as we want it to be. In those plans that offered nearly    funds  participation rates have now dropped to about the   th percentile. Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present  even then  it has negative consequences. So for those people who did choose to participate  the more choices available  the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds. The more choices available  the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts. Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well being. Well  over the past decade  we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices. They're more likely to delay choosing    procrastinate even when it goes against their best self interest. They're more likely to make worse choices    worse financial choices  medical choices. They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied  even when they do objectively better. The main reason for this is because  we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises  mustards  vinegars  jams  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display. So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques    techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues    that you can easily apply in your businesses. The first  Cut. You've heard it said before  but it's never been more true than today  that less is more. People are always upset when I say   Cut.  They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space. But in fact  what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut  get rid of those extraneous redundant options  well there's an increase in sales  there's a lowering of costs  there is an improvement of the choosing experience. When Proctor   Gamble went from    different kinds of Head   Shoulders to     they saw an increase in sales by    percent. When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their    worst selling cat litter products  they saw an increase in profits by    percent    a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs. You know  the average grocery store today offers you        products. The typical Walmart today offers you         products. But the ninth largest retailer  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is Aldi  and it offers you only       products    one kind of canned tomato sauce. Now in the financial savings world  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing  which was the program that they have at Harvard. Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund. For those people who actually want to choose  they're given    funds  not     or more funds. You know  often  people say   I don't know how to cut. They're all important choices.  And the first thing I do is I ask the employees   Tell me how these choices are different from one another. And if your employees can't tell them apart  neither can your consumers.  Now before we started our session this afternoon  I had a chat with Gary. And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all expenses paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world. Here's a description of the road. And I'd like you to read it. And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer. Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer. Is that all  All right  let me show you some more about this. You guys knew there was a trick  didn't you. Now who's ready to go on this trip. I think I might have actually heard more hands. All right. Now in fact  you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around  but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around. Because the pictures made it feel more real to you. Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem  which is concretization. That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices  they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice  and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way  in a very concrete way. Why do people spend an average of    to    percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash  Because it doesn't feel like real money. And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more. So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero  we did a study with people at ING    employees that are all working at ING    and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their     k  plan. And during that session  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be  but we added one little thing. The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more. By doing that simple thing  there was an increase in enrollment by    percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent. The third technique  Categorization. We can handle more categories than we can handle choices. So for example  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle. It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor  the magazine aisles range anywhere from     different kinds of magazines all the way up to    . But you know what  If I show you     magazines and I divide them up into    categories  versus I show you     magazines and divide them up into    categories  you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the     than if I gave you the    . Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. Here are two different jewelry displays. One is called  Jazz  and the other one is called  Swing.  If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz  clap your hands. Okay  there's some. If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing  clap your hands. Okay  a bit more. Now it turns out you're right. The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing  but you know what  This is a highly useless categorization scheme. The categories need to say something to the chooser  not the choice maker. And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. Who are they actually supposed to be informing  My fourth technique  Condition for complexity. It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can  we've just got to take it a little easier. We have to gradually increase the complexity. I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about. Let's take a very  very complicated decision  buying a car. Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car. You've got to make    different decisions  completely make up your car. Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision. Car colors  exterior car colors    I've got    choices. Engines  gearshift    four choices. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear. So half of the customers are going to go from high choice     car colors  to low choice  four gearshifts. The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice  four gearshifts  to    car colors  high choice. What am I going to look at  How engaged you are. If you keep hitting the default button per decision  that means you're getting overwhelmed  that means I'm losing you. What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again. We're losing them. They go from low choice to high choice  they're hanging in there. It's the same information. It's the same number of choices. The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented. If I start you off easy  I learn how to choose. Even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor  it still prepares me for how to choose. It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together  so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged. So let me recap. I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload    cut    get rid of the extraneous alternatives  concretize    make it real  categorize    we can handle more categories  less choices  condition for complexity. All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices    better for you  you can use them on yourself  better for the people that you are serving. Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing. And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing. Thank you very much. What I'm going to do is  I'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept that was developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland  Ohio. But before I do that  we have to go over the definition of what green is  'cause a lot of us have a different definition of it. Green. The product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means. There's plenty of things that are being called green now. What does it actually mean  We use three metrics to determine green. The first metric is  Is it sustainable  Which means  are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations  Is it alternative  Is it different than what is being used today  or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what's used conventionally  And three  Is it renewable  Does it come from Earth's natural replenishing resources  such as sun  wind and water  Now  my task at NASA is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels. Extreme green. Why aviation  The field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined. We need to find an alternative. Also it's a national aeronautics directive. One of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels  biofuels  using domestic and safe  friendly resources. Now  combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric   Actually  extreme green for us is all three together  that's why you see the plus there. I was told to say that. So it has to be the big three at GRC. That's another metric. Ninety seven percent of the world's water is saltwater. How about we use that  Combine that with number three. Do not use arable land. Because crops are already growing on that land that's very scarce around the world. Number two  Don't compete with food crops. That's already a well established entity  they don't need another entry. And lastly the most precious resource we have on this Earth is fresh water. Don't use fresh water. If   .  percent of the world's water is saltwater   .  percent is fresh water. Less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use. But    percent of the population lives within that one percent. So  combating my problem was  now I have to be extreme green and meet the big three. Ladies and gentlemen  welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility. This is a facility dedicated to the next generation of aviation fuels using halophytes. A halophyte is a salt tolerating plant. Most plants don't like salt  but halophytes tolerate salt. We also are using weeds and we are also using algae. The good thing about our lab is  we've had       visitors in the last two years. Why do you think that's so  Because we are on to something special. So  in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously  and on the right hand side you'll see algae. If you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels  algae is a viable option  there's a lot of funding right now  and we have an algae to fuels program. There's two types of algae growing. One is a closed photobioreactor that you see here  and what you see on the other side is our species   we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus. Our job at NASA is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors. Now the problems with closed photobioreactors are  They are quite expensive  they are automated  and it's very difficult to get them in large scale. So on large scale what do they use  We use open pond systems. Now  around the world they are growing algae  with this racetrack design that you see here. Looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well  but when it gets around the last turn  which I call turn four   it's stagnant. We actually have a solution for that. In the GreenLab in our open pond system we use something that happens in nature  waves. We actually use wave technology on our open pond systems. We have    percent mixing and our lipid content is higher than a closed photobioreactor system  which we think is significant. There is a drawback to algae  however  It's very expensive. Is there a way to produce algae inexpensively  And the answer is  yes. We do the same thing we do with halophytes  and that is  climatic adaptation. In our GreenLab we have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater. What we do  We take a potential species  we start at freshwater  we add a little bit more salt  when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as Brazil   right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants   the next tank represents Africa  the next tank represents Arizona  the next tank represents Florida  and the next tank represents California or the open ocean. What we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world  where there's barren desert. We are being very successful so far. Now  here's one of the problems. If you are a farmer  you need five things to be successful  You need seeds  you need soil  you need water and you need sun  and the last thing that you need is fertilizer. Most people use chemical fertilizers. But guess what  We do not use chemical fertilizer. Wait a second  I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer. Believe it or not  in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems    percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves. The    percent that's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous. We have a natural solution  fish. No we don't cut up the fish and put them in there. Fish waste is what we use. As a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies  that we've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way to seawater. Freshwater mollies  cheap  they love to make babies  and they love to go to the bathroom. And the more they go to the bathroom  the more fertilizer we get  the better off we are  believe it or not. It should be noted that we use sand as our soil  regular beach sand. Fossilized coral. So a lot of people ask me   How did you get started   Well  we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab. It's a seedling lab. We have    different species of halophytes  and five are winners. What we do here is   actually it should be called a death lab  'cause we try to kill the seedlings  make them rough   and then we come to the GreenLab. What you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing  a macro algae that I'll talk about in a minute. And lastly  it's me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work  I don't just talk about what I do. Here's the plant species. Salicornia virginica. It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant. Everywhere we go we see it. It's all over the place  from Maine all the way to California. We love that plant. Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very difficult to get around the world. It is the highest lipid content that we have  but it has a shortcoming  It's short. Now you take europaea  which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have. And what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology   combine all three to make a high growth  high lipid plant. Next  when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay   soybean fields gone   we came up with an idea  Can you have a plant that has a land reclamation positive in Delaware  And the answer is yes. It's called seashore mallow. Kosteletzkya virginica   say that five times fast if you can. This is a     percent usable plant. The seeds  biofuels. The rest  cattle feed. It's there for    years  it's working very well. Now we get to Chaetomorpha. This is a macro algae that loves excess nutrients. If you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks. This species is so significant to us. The properties are very close to plastic. We are trying right now to convert this macro algae into a bioplastic. If we are successful  we will revolutionize the plastics industry. So  we have a seed to fuel program. We have to do something with this biomass that we have. And so we do G.C. extraction  lipid optimization  so on and so forth  because our goal really is to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels  aviation specifics  so on and so forth. So far we talked about water and fuel  but along the way we found out something interesting about Salicornia  It's a food product. So we talk about ideas worth spreading  right  How about this  In sub Saharan Africa  next to the sea  saltwater  barren desert  how about we take that plant  plant it  half use for food  half use for fuel. We can make that happen  inexpensively. You can see there's a greenhouse in Germany that sells it as a health food product. This is harvested  and in the middle here is a shrimp dish  and it's being pickled. So I have to tell you a joke. Salicornia is known as sea beans  saltwater asparagus and pickle weed. So we are pickling pickle weed in the middle. Oh  I thought it was funny.  Laughter  And at the bottom is seaman's mustard. It does make sense  this is a logical snack. You have mustard  you are a seaman  you see the halophyte  you mix it together  it's a great snack with some crackers. And last  garlic with Salicornia  which is what I like. So  water  fuel and food. None of this is possible without the GreenLab team. Just like the Miami Heat has the big three  we have the big three at NASA GRC. That's myself  professor Bob Hendricks  our fearless leader  and Dr. Arnon Chait. The backbone of the GreenLab is students. Over the last two years we've had    different students from around the world working at GreenLab. As a matter fact my division chief says a lot   You have a green university.  I say   I'm okay with that  'cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers  which is significant.  So  in first summary I presented to you what we think is a global solution for food  fuel and water. There's something missing to be complete. Clearly we use electricity. We have a solution for you   We're using clean energy sources here. So  we have two wind turbines connected to the GreenLab  we have four or five more hopefully coming soon. We are also using something that is quite interesting   there is a solar array field at NASA's Glenn Research Center  hasn't been used for    years. Along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues  we realized that they are still viable  so we are refurbishing them right now. In about    days or so they'll be connected to the GreenLab. And the reason why you see red  red and yellow  is a lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday   This is a picture taken on Saturday. There are no cars around  but you see my truck in yellow. I work on Saturday.  Laughter  This is a proof to you that I'm working. 'Cause we do what it takes to get the job done  most people know that. Here's a concept with this  We are using the GreenLab for a micro grid test bed for the smart grid concept in Ohio. We have the ability to do that  and I think it's going to work. So  GreenLab Research Facility. A self sustainable renewable energy ecosystem was presented today. We really  really hope this concept catches on worldwide. We think we have a solution for food  water  fuel and now energy. Complete. It's extreme green  it's sustainable  alternative and renewable and it meets the big three at GRC  Don't use arable land  don't compete with food crops  and most of all  don't use fresh water. So I get a lot of questions about   What are you doing in that lab   And I usually say   None of your business  that's what I'm doing in the lab.   Laughter  And believe it or not  my number one goal for working on this project is I want to help save the world. Is there a real you  This might seem to you  like a very odd question. Because  you might ask  how do we find the real you  how do you know what the real you is  And so forth. But the idea that there must be a real you  surely that's obvious. If there's anything real  in the world  it's you. Well  I'm not quite sure. At least we have to understand  a bit better what that means. Now certainly  I think there are lots of things in our culture around us which sort of reinforce the idea that for each one of us  we have a kind of a core  an essence. There is something about what it means to be you which defines you  and it's kind of permanent and unchanging. The most kind of crude way in which we have it  are things like horoscopes. You know  people are very wedded to these  actually. People put them on their Facebook profile as though they are meaningul  you even know  your Chinese horoscope as well. There are also  more scientific versions of this  all sorts of ways of profiling personality type  such as the Myers Briggs tests  for example. I don't know if you've done those. A lot of companies  use these for recruitment. You answer a lot of questions  and this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality. And of course  the popular fascination  with this is enormous. In magazines like this  you'll see  in the bottom left corner  they'll advertise in virtually every issue some kind of personality thing. And if you pick up one of those magazines  it's hard to resist  isn't it  Doing the test to find what is your learning style  what is your loving style  or what is your working style  Are you this kind of person or that  So I think that we have a common sense idea that there is a kind of core  or essence of ourselves to be discovered. And that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves  something that's the same throughout life. Well  that's the idea I want to challenge. And I have to say now  I'll say it a bit later  but I'm not challenging this just because I'm weird  the challenge actually has a very  very long and distinguished history. Here's the common sense idea. There is you. You are the individuals you are  and you have this kind of core. Now in your life  what happens is that you  of course  accumulate different experiences and so forth. So you have memories  and these memories help  to create what you are. You have desires  maybe for a cookie  maybe for something that we don't want to talk about at    o'clock in the morning in a school. You will have beliefs. This is a number plate from someone in America. I don't know whether this number plate  which says  messiah     indicates that the driver believes in the messiah  or that they are the messiah. Either way  they have beliefs  about messiahs. We have knowledge. We have sensations and experiences as well. It's not just intellectual things. So this is kind of  the common sense model  I think  of what a person is. There is a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences. But the suggestion  I want to put to you today is that there's something  fundamentally wrong with this model. And I can show you what's wrong with one click. Which is there isn't actually a  you  at the heart of all these experiences. Strange thought  Well  maybe not. What is there  then  Well  clearly there are memories  desires  intentions  sensations  and so forth. But what happens is these things exist  and they're kind of all integrated  they're overlapped  they're connected in various different ways. They're connecting partly  and perhaps even mainly  because they all belong to one body and one brain. But there's also a narrative   a story we tell about ourselves  the experiences we have when we remember past things. We do things because of other things. So what we desire is partly a result of what we believe  and what we remember is also informing us what we know. And so really  there are all these things  like beliefs  desires   sensations  experiences  they're all related to each other  and that just is you. In some ways  it's a small difference from the common sense understanding. In some ways  it's a massive one. It's the shift between thinking of yourself as a thing which has  all the experiences of life  and thinking of yourself as simply that collection of all experiences in life. You are the sum of your parts. Now those parts are also physical parts   of course  brains  bodies and legs and things  but they aren't so important  actually. If you have a heart transplant  you're still the same person. If you have a memory transplant  are you the same person  If you have a belief transplant   would you be the same person  Now this idea  that what we are   the way to understand ourselves  is as not of some permanent being  which has experiences  but is kind of a collection of experiences  might strike you as kind of weird. But actually  I don't think  it should be weird. In a way  it's common sense. Because I just invite you  to think about  by comparison  think about pretty much anything else in the universe  maybe apart from the  very most fundamental forces or powers. Let's take something like water. Now my science isn't very good. We might say something like  water has two parts hydrogen and one parts oxygen  right  We all know that. I hope no one in this room thinks that what that means is there is a thing called water   and attached to it are hydrogen and oxygen atoms  and that's what water is. Of course we don't. We understand  very easily  very straightforwardly  that water is nothing more than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged. Everything else in the universe is the same. There's no mystery about my watch  for example. We say the watch has a face  and hands  and a mechanism and a battery  But what we really mean is  we don't think  there is a thing called the watch to which we then attach all these bits. We understand very clearly  that you get the parts of the watch  you put them together  and you create a watch. Now if everything else  in the universe is like this  why are we different  Why think of ourselves as somehow not just being  a collection of all our parts  but somehow being a separate  permanent entity which has those parts  Now this view is not particularly new   actually. It has quite a long lineage. You find it in Buddhism  you find it in   th     th century philosophy going through to the current day  people like Locke and Hume. But interestingly  it's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience. This is Paul Broks   he's a clinical neuropsychologist  and he says this   We have a deep intuition that there is a core  an essence there   and it's hard to shake off  probably impossible to shake off   I suspect. But it's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together.  So when you look at the brain  and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self  you find that there isn't  a central control spot in the brain. There is no kind of center where everything happens. There are lots of different processes in the brain  all of which operate  in a way  quite independently. But it's because of the way  that they relate that we get this sense of self. The term I use in the book   I call it the ego trick. It's like a mechanical trick. It's not that we don't exist  it's just that the trick is  to make us feel that inside of us is something more unified than is really there. Now you might think this is a worrying idea. You might think that if it's true  that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self  no permanent essence  does that mean that really  the self is an illusion  Does it mean that we really don't exist  There is no real you. Well  a lot of people actually do use  this talk of illusion and so forth. These are three psychologists  Thomas Metzinger  Bruce Hood  Susan Blackmore  a lot of these people do talk  the language of illusion  the self is an illusion  it's a fiction. But I don't think this is  a very helpful way of looking at it. Go back to the watch. The watch isn't an illusion   because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts. In the same way   we're not illusions either. The fact that we are  in some ways  just this very  very complex collection  ordered collection of things  does not mean we're not real. I can give you  a very sort of rough metaphor for this. Let's take something like a waterfall. These are the Iguazu Falls  in Argentina. Now if you take something like this  you can appreciate the fact  that in lots of ways  there's nothing permanent about this. For one thing  it's always changing. The waters  are always carving new channels. with changes and tides and the weather  some things dry up   new things are created. Of course the water that flows  through the waterfall is different every single instance. But it doesn't mean that  the Iguazu Falls are an illusion. It doesn't mean it's not real. What it means is we have  to understand what it is as something which has a history  has certain things that keep it together  but it's a process  it's fluid   it's forever changing. Now that  I think  is a model for understanding ourselves  and I think it's a liberating model. Because if you think that you have this fixed  permanent essence  which is always the same  throughout your life  no matter what  in a sense you're kind of trapped. You're born with an essence  that's what you are until you die  if you believe in an afterlife   maybe you continue. But if you think of yourself as being  in a way  not a thing as such   but a kind of a process  something that is changing  then I think that's quite liberating. Because unlike the the waterfalls  we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree. Now we've got to be careful here  right  If you watch the X Factor too much  you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be. That's not true. I've heard some fantastic musicians this morning  and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them. I could practice hard  and maybe be good  but I don't have that really natural ability. There are limits to what we can achieve. There are limits to what  we can make of ourselves. But nevertheless  we do have  this capacity to  in a sense  shape ourselves. The true self  as it were then  is not something that is just there for you to discover  you don't sort of look into your soul and find your true self  What you are partly doing  at least  is actually creating your true self. And this  I think  is very  very significant  particularly at this stage of life you're at. You'll be aware of the fact how much of you changed over recent years. If you have any videos of yourself   three or four years ago  you probably feel embarrassed  because you don't recognize yourself. So I want to get that message over  that what we need to do is think about ourselves as things that we can shape  and channel and change. This is the Buddha  again   Well makers lead the water  fletchers bend the arrow  carpenters bend a log of wood  wise people fashion themselves.  And that's the idea  I want to leave you with  that your true self is not something  that you will have to go searching for  as a mystery  and maybe never ever find. To the extent you have a true self  it's something that you in part discover  but in part create. and that  I think   is a liberating and exciting prospect. Thank you very much. It is actually a reality today that you can download products from the Web    product data  I should say  from the Web    perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste  and have that information sent to a desktop machine that will fabricate it for you on the spot. We can actually build for you  very rapidly  a physical object. And the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing  or  D printing. This is a  D printer. They have been around for almost    years now  which is quite amazing to think of  but they're only just starting to filter into the public arena. And typically  you would take data  like the data of a pen here  which would be a geometric representation of that product in  D  and we would pass that data with material into a machine. And a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built. And we can take out the physical product  and ready to use  or to  perhaps  assemble into something else. But if these machines have been around for almost    years  why don't we know about them  Because typically they've been too inefficient  inaccessible  they've not been fast enough  they've been quite expensive. But today  it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful. Many barriers are breaking down. That means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines  if not this minute. And it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing  and most certainly our lives  our businesses and the lives of our children. So how does it work  It typically reads CAD data  which is a product design data created on professional product design programs. And here you can see an engineer    it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer    create a product in  D. And this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into two dimensional representations of that product all the way through    almost like slicing it like salami. And that data  layer by layer  gets passed through the machine  starting at the base of the product and depositing material  layer upon layer  infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer in an additive process. And this material that's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form. And the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting. In this case  we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS. It's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer. And over time    quite rapidly actually  in a number of hours    we can build a physical product  ready to take out of the machine and use. And this is quite an extraordinary idea  but it is reality today. So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way. They were all  D printed. And you can see  they're ranging from shoes  rings that were made out of stainless steal  phone covers out of plastic  all the way through to spinal implants  for example  that were created out of medical grade titanium  and engine parts. But what you'll notice about all of these products is they're very  very intricate. The design is quite extraordinary. Because we're taking this data in  D form  slicing it up before it gets past the machine  we can actually create structures that are more intricate than any other manufacturing technology    or  in fact  are impossible to build in any other way. And you can create parts with moving components  hinges  parts within parts. So in some cases  we can abolish totally the need for manual labor. It sounds great. It is great. We can have  D printers today that build structures like these. This is almost three meters high. And this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of about five millimeters to    mm in thickness    slowly growing this structure. This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro. And you can actually walk into it. And on the other end of the spectrum  this is a microstructure. It's created depositing layers of about four microns. So really the resolution is quite incredible. The detail that you can get today is quite amazing. So who's using it  Typically  because we can create products very rapidly  it's been used by product designers  or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design. And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse. There's very little economies of scale. So you can now create one offs very easily. Architects  for example  they want to create prototypes of buildings. Again you can see  this is a building of the Free University in Berlin and it was designed by Foster and Partners. Again  not buildable in any other way. And very hard to even create this by hand. Now this is an engine component. It was developed by a company called Within Technologies and  T RPD. It's very  very  very detailed inside with the design. Now  D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production. If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here  you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it  which means it's a more efficient product. You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually. It's more efficient because we can now create all these cavities within the object that cool fluid. And it's used by aerospace and automotive. It's a lighter part and it uses less material waste. So it's overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products. And then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure  we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within implants. Typically an implant is more effective within the body if it's more porous  because our body tissue will grow into it. There's a lower chance of rejection. But it's very hard to create that in standard ways. With  D printing  we're seeing today that we can create much better implants. And in fact  because we can create bespoke products en masse  one offs  we can create implants that are specific to individuals. So as you can see  this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic. And we're starting to see it being used for final end products. And in fact  as the detail is improving  the quality is improving  the price of the machines are falling and they're becoming quicker. They're also now small enough to sit on a desktop. You can buy a machine today for about      that you can create yourself  which is quite incredible. But then it begs the question  why don't we all have one in our home  Because  simply  most of us here today don't know how to create the data that a  D printer reads. If I gave you a  D printer  you wouldn't know how to direct it to make what you want it to. But there are more and more technologies  software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers. I believe we're at a tipping point where this is now something that we can't avoid. This technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and  I believe  cause a revolution in manufacturing. So today  you can download products from the Web    anything you would have on your desktop  like pens  whistles  lemon squeezers. You can use software like Google SketchUp to create products from scratch very easily.  D printing can be also used to download spare parts from the Web. So imagine you have  say  a Hoover in your home and it has broken down. You need a spare part  but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued. Can you imagine going online    this is a reality    and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information  that data  and having the product made for you at home  ready to use  on your demand  And in fact  because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making themselves. You're having machines fabricate themselves. These are parts of a RepRap machine  which is a kind of desktop printer. But what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse. There's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in China. You can just make it physically on the spot. Which means that we can now present to the public the next generation of customization. This is something that is now possible today  that you can direct personally how you want your products to look. We're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization. Brands like Nike are doing it. It's all over the Web. In fact  every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products on a daily basis    all the way from Smart Cars to Prada to Ray Ban  for example. But this is not really mass customization  it's known as variant production  variations of the same product. What you could do is really influence your product now and shape manipulate your product. I'm not sure about you guys  but I've had experiences when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that I know where I want to sit in my house and I just can't find the right thing  or that perfect piece of jewelry as a gift or for myself. Imagine that you can now engage with a brand and interact  so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you're about to buy. You can today download a product with software like this  view the product in  D. This is the sort of  D data that a machine will read. This is a lamp. And you can start iterating the design. You can direct what color that product will be  perhaps what material. And also  you can engage in shape manipulation of that product  but within boundaries that are safe. Because obviously the public are not professional product designers. The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible. And when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design  they click  Enter  and this data gets converted into the data that a  D printer reads and gets passed to a  D printer  perhaps on someone's desktop. But I don't think that that's immediate. I don't think that will happen soon. What's more likely  and we're seeing it today  is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center. This means lower carbon footprint. We're now  instead of shipping a product across the world  we're sending data across the Internet. Here's the product being built. You can see  this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later. It's this lamp  as you can see here. So as long as you have the data  you can create the part on demand. And you don't necessarily need to use this for just aesthetic customization  you can use it for functional customization  scanning parts of the body and creating things that are made to fit. So we can run this through to something like prosthetics  which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap. Or we can create very specific prosthetics for that individual. Scanning teeth today  you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you. While you wait at the dentist  a machine will quietly be creating this for you ready to insert in the teeth. And the idea of now creating implants  scanning data  an MRI scan of somebody can now be converted into  D data and we can create very specific implants for them. And applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies. You know  this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree. It's very intricate. You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way. But with MRI data  we can just build the product  as you can see  very intricately. Using this process  pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today. So one of the pioneers  for example  is Dr. Anthony Atala  and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts    bladders  valves  kidneys. Now this is not something that's ready for the public  but it is in working progress. So just to finalize  we're all individual. We all have different preferences  different needs. We like different things. We're all different sizes and our companies the same. Businesses want different things. Without a doubt in my mind  I believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it. Thank you. Yeah  so a couple of years ago I was turning     and I don't like being   . And I started grappling with this existential angst of what little I had done with my life. It wasn't the resume of breaking this record here  it was more like  who had I become  How had I spent my valuable time  How could this have gone by like lightning  And I couldn't forgive myself for the countless  countless hours I had lost in negative thought    all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this. Just why  why didn't I do it better  Why  Why  Why  And then my mother died at   . And so I starting thinking  not only am I not happy with the past  now I'm getting choked with   I've only got    years left.  What am I going to do with this short amount of time that's just fleeting  And I'm not in the present whatsoever. And I decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream  an extreme dream  something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion  something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life  every minute of every day  because the dream was so big that I couldn't get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction. And I decided  it was an old dream that was lingering  that was from so many years ago  three decades ago    the only sort of world class swim I had tried and failed at back in my   s    was going from Cuba to Florida. It was deep in my imagination. No one's ever done it without a shark cage. It's daunting. It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean. It's probably  at my speed  at my age    for anybody's speed at anybody's age    going to take     maybe     hours of continuous swimming  never getting out on the boat. And I started to train. I hadn't swum for    years  not a stroke. And I had kept in good shape  but swimming's a whole different animal. As a matter of fact  this picture is supposed to be me during training. It's a smiling face. And when you're training for this sport  you are not smiling. It's an arduous  difficult sport  and I don't remember smiling at any time during this sport. As I said  I respect other sports  and I compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events  but this is a sensory deprivation  a physical duress. And when I started in with the eight hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hour swims  I knew I had it  because I was making it through these. And when I said I'm going to go out and do a    hour swim  and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night  and we come in and it's    hours and    minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done  the trainer says   That's great. It's    hours    minutes. Who cares the last two minutes   I say   No  it's got to be    hours   and I swim another minute out and another minute back to make the    hours. And I put together an expedition. It's not that I didn't have help  but honestly  I sort of led  I was the team leader. And to get the government permissions  you read in the paper  you think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday  Try going in with an armada like we had of    people and five boats and CNN's crew  etc. The navigation is difficult. There's a big river called the Gulf Stream that runs across and it's not going in the direction you are. It's going to the east and you'd like to go north. It's tricky. And there's dehydration. And there's hypothermia. And there are sharks. And there are all kinds of problems. And I gathered together  honestly  the world's leading experts in every possible way. And a month ago  the   rd of September  I stood on that shore and I looked across to that long  long faraway horizon and I asked myself  do you have it  Are your shoulders ready  And they were. They were prepared. No stone left unturned. Was the mind ready  You know  you're swimming with the fogged goggles  you're swimming at    strokes a minute  so you're never really focused on anything  you don't see well. You've got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head  because it's where the hypothermia starts  and so you don't hear very well. You're really left alone with your own thoughts. And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there in English  followed by German  followed by Spanish  followed by French. You save the French for last. And I had songs  I had a playlist in my head    not through headphones  in my own head    of    songs. And I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night  because that's when Neil Young comes out. And it's odd  isn't it  You'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's  Hallelujah  out in the majesty of the ocean  not songs about heroin addiction in New York City. But no  for some reason I couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing     A heard you knocking at my cellar door     I love you baby and I want some more     Ooh  ooh  the damage done    The night before I started  I finished Stephen Hawking's  The Grand Design.  And I couldn't wait to trip the mind fantastic. About the   th hour  I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe. Is there an edge  Is this an envelope we're living inside of  or no  does it go onto infinity in both time and space  And there's nothing like swimming for    hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this. I couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am  that nobody else in the world can do this swim. And I knew I could do it. And when I jumped into that water  I yelled in my mother's French   Courage   And I started swimming  and  oh my God  it was glassy. And we knew it  all    people on the boat  we all knew this was it  this was our time. And I reminded myself a couple hours in  you know  the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself. First of all  you're going to hit obstacles. And even though you're feeling great at any one moment  don't take it for granted  be ready  because there's going to be pain  there's going to be suffering. It's not going to feel this good all the way across. And I was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things    the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater. You're immersed in the liquid. Your body doesn't like the saltwater. After a couple of days  three days  you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways. But no  two hours in  wham  Never in my life ... I knew there were Portuguese men o' war  all kinds of moon jellies  all kinds of things  but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters. And I was on fire    excruciating  excruciating pain. I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm. Evidently  a piece this big of tentacle has a hundred thousand little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin  it's sending a venom. The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish. And every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system. So first I feel like boiling hot oil  I've been dipped in. And I'm yelling out   Fire  Fire  Fire  Fire  Help me  Somebody help me   And the next thing is paralysis. I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here  and I can't breathe. And now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke  I'm sort of crabbing it this way. Then come convulsions. A young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me. He's stung. They drag him out on the boat  and he's    evidently  I didn't see any of this    but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out. He's    years old  very well built  lean  he's six foot  five  weighs     lbs.  and he is down. And he is crying and he's yelling to my trainer who's trying to help me. And he's saying   Bonnie  I think I'm going to die. My breath is down to three breaths a minute. I need help  and I can't help Diana.  So that was at eight o'clock at night. The doctor  medical team from University of Miami arrived at five in the morning. So I swam through the night  and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots. I didn't get out  but was in the water taking prednisone shots  taking Xanax  oxygen to the face. It was like an ICU unit in the water. And I guess the story is that even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly  they're done. They either die or they quickly get to a hospital. And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day. And the next night at dusk  again  wham  The box jelly again    all across the neck  all across here. And this time  I don't like it  I didn't want to give into it  but there's a difference between a non stop swim and a staged swim. And I gave in to the staged swim. And they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board. And I got back in. And I swam through that night and into the next day. And at    hours  this body couldn't make it. The devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that I couldn't make the progress I wanted. And the dream was crushed. And how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together. And I knew about the jellyfish  but I was sort of cavalier. A lot of athletes have this  you know  sort of invincibility. They should worry about me. I don't worry about them. I'll just swim right through them. We've got benadryl on board. If I get stung  I'll just grin and bear it. Well there was no grin and bearing this. As a matter of fact  the best advice I got was from an elementary school class in the Caribbean. And I was telling these kids      of them    they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor    and I was telling them about the jellyfish and how they're gelatinous and you can't see them at night especially. And they have these long    to    to    ft. tentacles. And they do this wrapping. And they can send the poison into the system. And a little kid from the back was like this. And I said   What's your name    Henry.   Henry  what's your question   He said   Well  I didn't have a question so much as I had a suggestion.  He said   You know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they wear bombs   And I said   Well it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit  but yeah  I know those guys.  He said   That's what you need. You need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this.   And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish  they're going to be busy with them  and you'll just scoot around.  I said   Oh  it's like a suicide army.  He said   That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need.  And little did I know  that you should listen to eight year olds. And so I started that swim in a bathing suit like normal  and  no joke  this is it  it came from the shark divers. I finished the swim like this. I was swimming with this thing on. That's how scared of the jellyfish I was. So now what do I do  I wouldn't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives. Because we've all had them  haven't we  We've all had a heartache. And so my journey now is to find some sort of grace in the face of this defeat. And I can look at the journey  not just the destination. I can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight and say I was courageous. Yeah. Thank you. And with all sincerity  I can say  I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way  because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore  I got there with that goal. When you live that way  when you live with that kind of passion  there's no time  there's no time for regrets  you're just moving forward. And I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way  swim or no swim. But the difference in accepting this particular defeat is that sometimes  if cancer has won  if there's death and we have no choice  then grace and acceptance are necessary. But that ocean's still there. This hope is still alive. And I don't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years  and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails  but I can swim from Cuba to Florida  and I will swim from Cuba to Florida. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And so  what after that  Are you going to swim the Atlantic  No  that's the last swim. It's the only swim I'm interested in. But I'm ready. And by the way  a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on Wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was August   nd       and for some odd reason in Wikipedia  they had my death date too. He said   Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born  New York City  and it's going to be in January of '     I said   Nope. I didn't know.  And now I'm going to live to   . I have three more years than I thought. And so I ask myself  I'm starting to ask myself now  even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me  I'm asking myself  and maybe I can ask you tonight too  to paraphrase the poet Mary Oliver  she says   So what is it  what is it you're doing  with this one wild and precious life of yours   Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Live it large. Live it large. I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change. And I think it starts with one physician  and that's me. And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that. Before I actually begin the meat of my talk  let's begin with a bit of baseball. Hey  why not  We're near the end  we're getting close to the World Series. We all love baseball  don't we  Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics. And there's hundreds of them.  Moneyball  is about to come out  and it's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team. I'm going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of. It's called batting average. So we talk about a      a batter who bats    . That means that ballplayer batted safely  hit safely three times out of    at bats. That means hit the ball into the outfield  it dropped  it didn't get caught  and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe. Three times out of   . Do you know what they call a     hitter in Major League Baseball  Good  really good  maybe an all star. Do you know what they call a     baseball hitter  That's somebody who hit  by the way  four times safely out of every   . Legendary    as in Ted Williams legendary    the last Major League Baseball player to hit over     during a regular season. Now let's take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfortable  or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I'm going to talk to you about. Suppose you have appendicitis and you're referred to a surgeon who's batting     on appendectomies. Somehow this isn't working out  is it  Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who's batting     on angioplasties. But  but  you know what  She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail. And she's hitting a    . Somehow this isn't working. But I'm going to ask you a question. What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon  an OBGYN  a paramedic is supposed to be         very good. Now truth of the matter is  nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat. What we do though is we send each one of them  including myself  out into the world with the admonition  be perfect. Never ever  ever make a mistake  but you worry about the details  about how that's going to happen. And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school. I was an obsessive compulsive student. In high school  a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test. And so I did. And I studied in my little garret at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital  not far from here. And I memorized everything. I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle  every branch of every artery that came off the aorta  differential diagnoses obscure and common. I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis. And all the while  I was amassing more and more knowledge. And I did well  I graduated with honors  cum laude. And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything  or as much as possible  as close to everything as possible  that it would immunize me against making mistakes. And it worked for a while  until I met Mrs. Drucker. I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working. At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation. And it was my job  when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult  to see that patient in emerg. and to report back to my attending. And I saw Mrs. Drucker  and she was breathless. And when I listened to her  she was making a wheezy sound. And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope  I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart fails  and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward  some of the blood backs up into the lung  the lungs fill up with blood  and that's why you have shortness of breath. And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make. I made it and I set to work treating her. I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. I gave her medications that we call diuretics  water pills  to get her to pee out the access fluid. And over the course of the next hour and a half or two  she started to feel better. And I felt really good. And that's when I made my first mistake  I sent her home. Actually  I made two more mistakes. I sent her home without speaking to my attending. I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do  which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself. And he knew her  he would have been able to furnish additional information about her. Maybe I did it for a good reason. Maybe I didn't want to be a high maintenance resident. Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients without even having to contact him. The second mistake that I made was worse. In sending her home  I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me   Goldman  not a good idea. Don't do this.  In fact  so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker   Do you think it's okay if she goes home   And the nurse thought about it and said very matter of factly   Yeah  I think she'll do okay.  I can remember that like it was yesterday. So I signed the discharge papers  and an ambulance came  paramedics came to take her home. And I went back to my work on the wards. All the rest of that day  that afternoon  I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach. But I carried on with my work. And at the end of the day  I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do. I walked through the emergency department on my way home. And it was there that another nurse  not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before  but another nurse  said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread. Others in medicine dread them as well  but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly. The three words are  Do you remember   Do you remember that patient you sent home   the other nurse asked matter of factly.  Well she's back   in just that tone of voice. Well she was back all right. She was back and near death. About an hour after she had arrived home  after I'd sent her home  she collapsed and her family called     and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of     which is in severe shock. And she was barely breathing and she was blue. And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops. They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure. They put her on a ventilator. And I was shocked and shaken to the core. And I went through this roller coaster  because after they stabilized her  she went to the intensive care unit  and I hoped against hope that she would recover. And over the next two or three days  it was clear that she was never going to wake up. She had irreversible brain damage. And the family gathered. And over the course of the next eight or nine days  they resigned themselves to what was happening. And at about the nine day mark  they let her go    Mrs. Drucker  a wife  a mother and a grandmother. They say you never forget the names of those who die. And that was my first time to be acquainted with that. Over the next few weeks  I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine    where I felt alone  isolated  not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel  because you can't talk about it with your colleagues. You know that healthy kind  when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions  but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say  I'll never make that mistake again. And you make amends and you never make that mistake again. That's the kind of shame that is a teacher. The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside. It's the one that says  not that what you did was bad  but that you are bad. And it was what I was feeling. And it wasn't because of my attending  he was a doll. He talked to the family  and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued. And I kept asking myself these questions. Why didn't I ask my attending  Why did I send her home  And then at my worst moments  Why did I make such a stupid mistake  Why did I go into medicine  Slowly but surely  it lifted. I began to feel a bit better. And on a cloudy day  there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered  maybe I could feel better again. And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again  please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work. And then it happened again. Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto  and I saw a    year old man with a sore throat. It was busy  I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here. I looked at his throat  it was a little bit pink. And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way. And even as he was walking out the door  he was still sort of pointing to his throat. And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift  and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office. And she said the three words  Do you remember   Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat   Well it turns out  he didn't have a strep throat. He had a potentially life threatening condition called epiglottitis. You can Google it  but it's an infection  not of the throat  but of the upper airway  and it can actually cause the airway to close. And fortunately he didn't die. He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days. And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work  until it happened again and again and again. Twice in one emergency shift  I missed appendicitis. Now that takes some doing  especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but    people a night. Now in both cases  I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care. One I thought had a kidney stone. I ordered a kidney X ray. When it turned out to be normal  my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons. The other one had a lot of diarrhea. I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him. And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant  called the surgeons. In both cases  they had their operations and they did okay. But each time  they were gnawing at me  eating at me. And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say  which is total B.S. Some of my doozies have been in the last five years. Alone  ashamed and unsupported. Here's the problem  If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes  if I can't find the still small voice that tells me what really happened  how can I share it with my colleagues  How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing  If I were to walk into a room    like right now  I have no idea what you think of me. When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure  Oh yeah  you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor  but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes. If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now  I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable  somebody would crack a joke  they'd change the subject and we would move on. And in fact  if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital  believe me  I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person. That's the system that we have. It's a complete denial of mistakes. It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians    those who make mistakes and those who don't  those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can  those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes. And it's almost like an ideological reaction  like the antibodies begin to attack that person. And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine  what will we be left with  but a safe system. But there are two problems with that. In my    years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism  I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can  from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show  White Coat  Black Art.  And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous. We work in a system where errors happen every day  where one in    medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage  where hospital acquired infections are getting more and more numerous  causing havoc and death. In this country  as many as        Canadians die of preventable medical errors. In the United States  the Institute of Medicine pegged it at        . In both cases  these are gross underestimates  because we really aren't ferreting out the problem as we should. And here's the thing. In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years  we can't keep up with it. Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive. We can't get rid of it. We have our cognitive biases  so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain. Now take the same patient with chest pain  make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath  and suddenly my history is laced with contempt. I don't take the same history. I'm not a robot  I don't do things the same way each time. And my patients aren't cars  they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time. Given all of that  mistakes are inevitable. So if you take the system  as I was taught  and weed out all the error prone health professionals  well there won't be anybody left. And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases  On my show  on  White Coat  Black Art   I made it a habit of saying   Here's my worst mistake   I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery   Here's my worst mistake   blah  blah  blah  blah  blah   What about yours   and I would point the microphone towards them. And their pupils would dilate  they would recoil  then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories. They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories. They want to be able to say   Look  don't make the same mistake I did.  What they need is an environment to be able to do that. What they need is a redefined medical culture. And it starts with one physician at a time. The redefined physician is human  knows she's human  accepts it  isn't proud of making mistakes  but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else. She shares her experience with others. She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes. And she points out other people's mistakes  not in a gotcha way  but in a loving  supportive way so that everybody can benefit. And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system  and when human beings run the system  they will make mistakes from time to time. So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving  supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so  and especially people like me  when we do make mistakes  we're rewarded for coming clean. My name is Brian Goldman. I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that  but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people. I still don't know what you think of me  but I can live with that. And let me close with three words of my own  I do remember. We do not invest in victims  we invest in survivors. And in ways both big and small  the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women. You can't count what you don't see. And we don't invest in what's invisible to us. But this is the face of resilience. Six years ago  I started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict. I set out to write a compelling economic story  one that had great characters  that no one else was telling  and one that I thought mattered. And that turned out to be women. I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of    for business school  a path I knew almost nothing about. None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland had graduated from college  let alone considered business school. But they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent. And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling. So if you're going to talk about jobs  then you have to talk about entrepreneurs. And if you're talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post conflict settings  then you must talk about women  because they are the population you have left. Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was    percent female. I want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs I've met and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years. I went to Afghanistan in      to work on a Financial Times piece  and there I met Kamila  a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly        a month    an astronomical sum in that context. And she had turned it down  she said  because she was going to start her next business  an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around Afghanistan. Business  she said  was critical to her country's future. Because long after this round of internationals left  business would help keep her country peaceful and secure. And she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women. So I was amazed. I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from  The Apprentice.  So I asked her   How in the world do you know this much about business  Why are you so passionate   She said   Oh Gayle  this is actually my third business. My first business was a dressmaking business I started under the Taliban. And that was actually an excellent business  because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood. And that's really how I became an entrepreneur.  Think about this  Here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets. And at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive  these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many. I couldn't leave the story  and I couldn't leave the topic either  because everywhere I went I met more of these women who no one seemed to know about  or even wish to. I went on to Bosnia  and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said   You know  Gayle  I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia  but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road. So maybe you could interview her.  So I went out reporting and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic who at that point was opening a new factory on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo. She had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage  sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the    or    family members who were counting on her for survival. By the time we met  she had    employees  most of them women  who were sending their boys and their girls to school. And she was just the start. I met women running essential oils businesses  wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency. So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover. And when this story posted  I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official. And I said   Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference  here are a couple of women.  But think about this. The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro. The biases  whether intentional or otherwise  are pervasive  and so are the misleading mental images. If you see the word  microfinance   what comes to mind  Most people say women. And if you see the word  entrepreneur   most people think men. Why is that  Because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women. Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self sufficiency and self respect  but we must move beyond micro hopes and micro ambitions for women  because they have so much greater hopes for themselves. They want to move from micro to medium and beyond. And in many places  they're there. In the U.S.  women owned businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by     . In South Korea and Indonesia  women own nearly half a million firms. China  women run    percent of all small businesses. And in the developing world overall  That figure is    to    percent. Nearly everywhere I go  I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance  access to markets and established business networks. They are often ignored because they're harder to help. It is much riskier to give a        dollar loan than it is to give a     dollar loan. And as the World Bank recently noted  women are stuck in a productivity trap. Those in small businesses can't get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness can't grow out of them. Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana. She sells chocolates. And she had come to Washington  not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan. She had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to Africa  Europe  the Middle East and far beyond    capital that would help her to employ more than the    people that she already has working for her  and capital that would fuel her own country's economic climb. The great news is we already know what works. Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us. We don't need to invent solutions because we have them    cash flow loans based in income rather than assets  loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral  because women often don't own land. And Kiva.org  the microlender  is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans. And that's just to start. Recently it has become very much in fashion to call women  the emerging market of the emerging market.  I think that is terrific. You know why  Because    and I say this as somebody who worked in finance        billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade. Because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth  and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets. How wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest     billion dollars unleashing women's economic potential  Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs  productivity  employment  child nutrition  maternal mortality  literacy and much  much more. Because  as the World Economic Forum noted  smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness. And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap    not one. So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity. We have so much room to grow. So you see  this is not about doing good  this is about global growth and global employment. It is about how we invest and it's about how we see women. And women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group. Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me   Gayle  these are great stories  but you're really writing about the exceptions.  Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons. First of all  for exceptions  there are a lot of them and they're important. Secondly  when we talk about men who are succeeding  we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated. And when we talk about women  they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored. And finally  there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional. So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them  This topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life. My mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold Tupperware at night so that I could have every opportunity possible. We shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores  and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work  we even applied for food stamps. And when I would feel sorry for myself as nine or    year old girls do  she would say to me   My dear  on a scale of major world tragedies  yours is not a three.  And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn't do it and nobody I knew had done it  I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact. And she told me   Never import other people's limitations.  And when I complained to my grandmother  a World War II veteran who worked in film for    years and who supported me from the age of     that I was terrified that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC for a fellowship overseas  I would never ever  ever find another job  she said   Kiddo  I'm going to tell you two things. First of all  no one turns down a Fulbright  and secondly  McDonald's is always hiring.   You will find a job. Take the leap.  The women in my family are not exceptions. The women in this room and watching in L.A. and all around the world are not exceptions. We are not a special interest group. We are the majority. And for far too long  we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others. It is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women  to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world. We can make a difference  and make a difference  not just for women  but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions. Together we can make certain that the so called exceptions begin to rule. When we change the way we see ourselves  others will follow. And it is time for all of us to think bigger. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you about  or share with you  a breakthrough new approach for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse. We're talking about a pick  pack and ship setting here. So as a hint  this solution involves hundreds of mobile robots  sometimes thousands of mobile robots  moving around a warehouse. And I'll get to the solution. But for a moment  just think about the last time that you ordered something online. You were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t shirt. So   click    you put it into your shopping cart. And then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too   click  And maybe a blue pair of shoes   click  So at this point you've assembled your order. You didn't stop to think  for a moment that that might not be a great outfit. But you hit  submit order.  And two days later  this package shows up on your doorstep. And you open the box and you're like  wow  there's my goo. Did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse  So I'm here to tell you  it's that guy right there. So deep in the middle of that picture  you see a classic pick pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting. Classically these pick workers will  spend    or    percent of their day wandering around the warehouse. They'll often walk as much as   or    miles in pursuit of those items of inventory. Not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders  it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders. So let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem. I was out in the Bay area  in '          the dot com boom. I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame out called Webvan. This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online. And it really came down to the fact that we couldn't do it cost effectively. Turns out e commerce was something that was very hard and very costly. In this particular instance we were trying to assemble    items of inventory into a few totes  onto a van to deliver to the home. And when you think about it  it was costing us    dollars. Imagine  we had an     can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote. And that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home. So long story short  during my one year at Webvan  what I realized by talking to  all the material handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking. Red item  green  blue  getting those three things in a box. So we said  there's just got to be a better way to do this. Existing material handling was set up to pump pallets and cases of goo to retail stores. Of course Webvan went out of business  and about a year and a half later  I was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me. And I started thinking about it again. And I said  let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker  or my vision for how it should work. I said  let's focus on the problem. I have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put red  green and blue in this box right here. What I need is a system where I put out my hand and   poof    the product shows up  and I pack it into the order  and now we're thinking  this would be a very operator centric approach to solving the problem. This is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem  But as you can see  orders can come and go  products can come and go. It allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem  and providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible. So how did I arrive at this notion  Well  actually it came from a brainstorming exercise  probably a technique that many of you use  It's this notion of testing your ideas. Take a blank sheet  of course  but then test your ideas at the limits   infinity  zero. In this particular case  we challenged ourselves with the idea  What if we had to build a distribution center in China  where it's a very  very low cost market  And say  labor is cheap  land is cheap. And we said specifically   What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a million  square foot distribution center   So naturally that led to ideas that said   Let's put lots of people in the warehouse.  And I said   Hold on  zero dollars per hour  what I would do is 'hire'        workers to come to the warehouse every morning at   a.m.  walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there. So you hold Captain Crunch  you hold the Mountain Dew  you hold the Diet Coke. If I need it  I'll call you  otherwise just stand there. But when I need Diet Coke and I call it  you guys talk amongst yourselves. Diet Coke walks up to the front   pick it  put it in the tote  away it goes.  Wow  what if the products could walk and talk on their own  That's a very interesting  very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse. So of course  labor isn't free  on that practical versus awesome spectrum. So we said mobile shelving   We'll put them on mobile shelving. We'll use mobile robots and we'll move the inventory around. And so we got underway on that and then I'm sitting on my couch in     . Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics  the opening ceremonies  I about fell out of my couch when I saw this. I'm like  that was the idea  We'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor  the stadium floor. But interestingly enough  this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful  impressive digital art  all without computers  I'm told  it was all peer to peer coordination and communication. You stand up  I'll squat down. And they made some fabulous art. It speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other. So that was a little bit of the journey. So of course  now what became the practical reality of this idea  Here is a warehouse. It's a pick  pack and ship center that has about        different SKUs. We'll call them red pens  green pens  yellow Post It Notes. We send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods. And we deliver them to the side of the building. So all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter. And the game here is to pick up the shelves  take them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker. This pick worker's life is completely different. Rather than wandering around the warehouse  she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her. So the process is very productive. Reach in  pick an item  scan the bar code  pack it out. By the time you turn around  there's another product there ready to be picked and packed. So what we've done is take out all of the non value added walking  searching  wasting  waited time  and we've developed a very  high fidelity way to pick these orders  where you point at it with a laser  scan the UPC barcode  and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into. So more productive  more accurate and  it turns out  it's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers. They actually complete the whole order. So they do red  green and blue  not just a part of the order. And they feel a little bit more in control of their environment. So the side effects of this approach are what really surprised us. We knew it was going  to be more productive. But we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse. But what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine. So this is again a cross fertilization of ideas. Here's a warehouse and we're thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures. The notion here is that you have    workers on  the right side of the screen that are now all independent autonomous pick workers. If the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom  it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers. Contrast that  for a moment  with the traditional method of using a conveyor. When one person passes the order to you  you put something in and pass it downstream. Everyone has to be in place for that serial process to work. This becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse. And then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we're tracking the popularity of the products. And we're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse. So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day. All that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations. Come in two days after Valentine's Day  and that candy  the leftover candy  has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there. One other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous. So whether you're doing two pick stations     pick stations  or     pick stations  the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work. In this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that's where the pick stations were. They sorted it out for themselves. So I'll conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick worker's actual day in the life of. So as we mentioned  the process is to move inventory along the highway and then find your way into these pick stations. And our software in the background understands what's going on  in each station  we direct the pods across the highway and we're attempting to get into a queuing system to present the work to the pick worker. What's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers. The faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few. But this pick worker now is literally having that experience that we described before. She puts out her hand. The product jumps into it. Or she has to reach in and get it. She scans it and  she puts it in the bucket. And all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes. So she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job. Never has any idle time  never has to leave her mat. And actually we think not only a more productive and more accurate way to fill orders. We think it's a more fulfilling way to fill orders. The reason we can say that  though  is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day. And sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as  they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren  or in one case a guy said   the Kiva zone is so stress free that I've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication.  That was at a pharmaceutical distributor  so they told us not to use that video. So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own  interesting processes and productivities can emerge. And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online  you break it open and the goo is in there  you'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order. Thank you. As the highest military commander of the Netherlands  with troops stationed around the world  I'm really honored to be here today. When I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue  I see a very special audience. You are the reason why I said yes to the invitation to come here today. When I look around  I see people who want to make a contribution. I see people who want to make a better world  by doing groundbreaking scientific work  by creating impressive works of art  by writing critical articles or inspiring books  by starting up sustainable businesses. And you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world. Some chose the microscope as their instrument. Others chose dancing or painting  or making music like we just heard. Some chose the pen. Others work through the instrument of money. Ladies and gentlemen  I made a different choice. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen ... I share your goals. I share the goals of the speakers you heard before. I did not choose to take up the pen  the brush  the camera. I chose this instrument. I chose the gun. For you  and you heard already  being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy. It may even feel scary. A real gun at a few feet's distance. Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness. You could even hear it. Let us cherish the fact that probably most of you have never been close to a gun. It means the Netherlands is a peaceful country. The Netherlands is not at war. It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets. Guns are not a part of our lives. In many countries  it is a different story. In many countries  people are confronted with guns. They are oppressed. They are intimidated    by warlords  by terrorists  by criminals. Weapons can do a lot of harm. They are the cause of much distress. Why then am I standing before you with this weapon  Why did I choose the gun as my instrument  Today I want to tell you why. Today I want to tell you why I chose the gun to create a better world. And I want to tell you how this gun can help. My story starts in the city of Nijmegen in the east of the Netherlands  the city where I was born. My father was a hardworking baker  but when he had finished work in the bakery  he often told me and my brother stories. And most of the time  he told me this story I'm going to share with you now. The story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier in the Dutch armed forces at the beginning of the Second World War. The Nazis invaded the Netherlands. Their grim plans were evident. They meant to rule by means of repression. Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans. Only brute force remained. It was our last resort. My father was there to provide it. As the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt  my father was an excellent marksman. When he aimed  he never missed. At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal near the city of Nijmegen. He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country  his country  our country. He fired. Nothing happened. He fired again. No German soldier fell to the ground. My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank. Hitler's troops marched on  and there was nothing my father could do about it. Until the day my father died  he was frustrated about missing these shots. He could have done something. But with an old gun  not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark. So this story stayed with me. Then in high school  I was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers    soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn't know. They liberated my birth town. It was then that I decided I would take up the gun    out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us. From the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil. And that is why I took up the gun    not to shoot  not to kill  not to destroy  but to stop those who would do evil  to protect the vulnerable  to defend democratic values  to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place. Ladies and gentlemen  I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons. I do not like guns. And once you have been under fire yourself  it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about. I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability. The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world. Now this may sound contradictory to you. But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deployments in Lebanon  Sarajevo and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence  this is also supported by cold  hard statistics. Violence has declined dramatically over the last     years. Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news  wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace. The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of    since the Middle Ages. And occurrences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of the Cold War. Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era. Why  Why has violence decreased  Has the human mind changed  Well  we were talking about the human mind this morning. Did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge  for violent rituals  for pure rage  Or is there something else  In his latest book  Harvard professor Steven Pinker    and many other thinkers before him    concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction  on a large scale  of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence    legitimized by a democratically elected government  legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system. In other words  a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control. Such a state monopoly on violence  first of all  serves as a reassurance. It removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies. Secondly  the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further. Abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war. Now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel. It enhances peace even further. Where there is no conflict  trade flourishes. And trade is another important incentive against violence. With trade  there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties. And when there is mutual gain  both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war. War is simply no longer the best option  and that is why violence has decreased. This  ladies and gentlemen  is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces. The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence. We do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us to do so. It is this legitimate  controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to reducing the statistics of war  conflict and violence around the globe. It is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars. My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace. And this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous. Failed states have no legitimized  democratically controlled use of force. Failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability. That is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict. That is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect of our foreign missions. That is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in Afghanistan. That is why we train police officers  we train judges  we train public prosecutors around the world. And that is why    and in the Netherlands  we are very unique in that    that is why the Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law. Ladies and gentlemen  looking at this gun  we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind. Every day I hope that politicians  diplomats  development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope. And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression. But until that day comes  we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle. Until that day comes  I stand for my father who tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun. I stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us. I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg  when she was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan. Ladies and gentlemen  until the day comes when we can do away with the gun  I hope we all agree that peace and stability do not come free of charge. It takes hard work  often behind the scenes. It takes good equipment and well trained  dedicated soldiers. I hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain and provide her with a good gun  instead of the bad gun my father was given. I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there  when they come home and when they are injured and need our care. They put their lives on the line  for us  for you  and we cannot let them down. I hope you will respect my soldiers  this soldier with this gun. Because she wants a better world. Because she makes an active contribution to a better world  just like all of us here today. Thank you very much. Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer    if not personally  then through a loved one  a family member  colleague  friend. And once our lives are touched by cancer  we quickly learn that there are basically three weapons  or three tools  that are available to fight the disease  surgery  radiation and chemotherapy. And once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions  again either personally or with our loved ones and family members  we also very quickly learn the benefits  the trade offs and the limitations of these tools. I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark and the TEDMED team for inviting me today to describe a fourth tool  a new tool  that we call Tumor Treating Fields. Tumor Treating Fields were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti  professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel. And they use low intensity electric fields to fight cancer. To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work  we first need to understand what are electric fields. Let me first address a few popular misconceptions. First of all  electric fields are not an electric current that is coursing through the tissue. Electric fields are not ionizing radiation  like X rays or proton beams  that bombard tissue to disrupt DNA. And electric fields are not magnetism. What electric fields are are a field of forces. And these forces act on  attract  bodies that have an electrical charge. The best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity. Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses. We can all picture astronauts in space. They float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them. But as that space shuttle returns to Earth  and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field  they begin to see the effects of gravity. They begin to be attracted towards Earth. And as they land  they're fully aligned in the gravitational field. We're  of course  all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now. That's why you're all in your chairs. And that's why we have to use our muscle energy to stand up  to walk around and to lift things. In cancer  cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth. We can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it's a mini space station. And in that space station we have the genetic material  the chromosomes  within a nucleus. And out in the cytoplasmic soup we have special proteins that are required for cell division that float freely in this soup in three dimensions. Importantly  those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body. As cell division begins the nucleus disintegrates  the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special proteins undergo a three dimensional sequence whereby they attach and they literally click into place end on end to form chains. These chains then progress and attach to the genetic material and pull the genetic material from one cell into two cells. And this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells  two cancer cells become four cancer cells  and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth. Tumor Treating Fields use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create an artificial electric field on that space station. And when that cellular space station is within the electric field  it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them. And it prevents them from forming those chains  those mitotic spindles  that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells. What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide for several hours. And they will either enter into this so called cellular suicide  programmed cell death  or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided. And we can observe this. What I'm going to show you next are two in vitro experiments. This is cultures  identical cultures  of cervical cancer cells. And we've stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains. The first clip shows a normal cell division without the Tumor Treating Fields. What we see are  first of all  a very active culture  a lot of divisions  and then very clear nuclei once the cells have separated. And we can see them dividing throughout. When we apply the fields    again  in the identical time scale to the identical culture    you're going to see something different. The cells round up for division  but they're very static in that position. We'll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide. The one within the circle manages. But see how much of the protein is still throughout the nucleus  even in the dividing cell. The one up there can't divide at all. And then this bubbling  this membrane bubbling  is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell. Formation of healthy mitotic spindles is necessary for division in all cell types. We've applied Tumor Treating Fields to over    different cancers in the lab  and we see this effect in all of them. Now importantly  these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect on normal undividing cells.    years ago  Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients. In that time  Novocure's developed two systems    one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body. The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer  GBM. GBM affects about        people in the U.S. each year. It's a death sentence. The expected five year survival is less than five percent. And the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year  and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again. Novocure conducted its first phase three randomized trial in patients with recurrent GBM. So these are patients who had received surgery  high dose radiation to the head and first line chemotherapy  and that had failed and their tumors had grown back. We divided the patients into two groups. The first group received second line chemotherapy  which is expected to double the life expectancy  versus no treatment at all. And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy. What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups    so the chemotherapy treated group and the Tumor Treating Field group    was the same. But importantly  the Tumor Treating Field group suffered none of the side effects typical of chemotherapy patients. They had no pain  suffered none of the infections. They had no nausea  diarrhea  constipation  fatigue that would be expected. Based on this trial  in April of this year  the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM. Importantly  it was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim. So I'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial. Robert Dill Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion. He won the gold medal in Moscow in the       meter pursuit. And five years ago  Robert was diagnosed with GBM. He received the standard treatments. He received surgery. He received high dose radiation to the head. And he received first line chemotherapy. A year after this treatment    in fact  this is his baseline MRI. You can see that the black regions in the upper right quadrant are the areas where he had surgery. And a year after that treatment  his tumor grew back with a vengeance. That cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence of the tumor. At this point  he was told by his doctors that he had about   months to live. He entered our trial. And here we can see him getting the therapy. First of all  these electrodes are noninvasive. They're attached to the skin in the area of the tumor. Here you can see that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages. The patients learn to do this themselves And then the patients can undergo all the activities of their daily life. There's none of the tiredness. There's none of what is called the  chemo head.  There's no sensation. It doesn't interfere with computers or electrical equipment. And the therapy is delivered continuously at home  without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually. These are Robert's MRIs  again  under only TTField treatment. This is a therapy that takes time to work. It's a medical device  it works when it's on. But what we can see is  by month six  the tumor has responded and it's begun to melt away. It's still there. By month     we could argue whether there's a little bit of material around the edges  but it's essentially completely gone. It's now five years since Robert's diagnosis  and he's alive  but importantly  he's healthy and he's at work. I'm going to let him  in this very short clip  describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words. I rate what I have today a bit different than what most people would assume. I am the happiest  the happiest person in the world. And every single morning I appreciate life. Every night I fall asleep very well  and I am  I repeat  the happiest man in the world  and I'm thankful I am alive. BD  Novocure's also working on lung cancer as the second target. We've run a phase two trial in Switzerland on  again  recurrent patients    patients who have received standard therapy and whose cancer has come back. I'm going to show you another clip of a woman named Lydia. Lydia's a    year old farmer in Switzerland. She was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago. She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years  none of which had an effect. Her cancer continued to grow. Three years ago  she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial. You can see  in her case  she's wearing her transducer arrays  one of the front of her chest  one on the back  and then the second pair side to side over the liver. You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator  but importantly you can also see that she is living her life. She is managing her farm. She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids. And when we talked to her  she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy  she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions. Her whole family suffered as her side effect profile came and went. Now she can run all of the activities of her farm. It's only the beginning. In the lab  we've observed tremendous synergies between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields. There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit. We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation and interrupt the self repair mechanisms that we have. There's now a new research project underway at the Karolinska in Sweden to prove that hypothesis. We have more trials planned for lung cancer  pancreatic cancer  ovarian cancer and breast cancer. And I firmly believe that in the next    years Tumor Treating Fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most difficult to treat solid tumors. I'm also very hopeful that in the next decades  we will make big strides on reducing that death rate that has been so challenging in this disease. Thank you.
