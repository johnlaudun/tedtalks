I'm here today to talk about social change  not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that  but a new business model for social change  a new way of tackling the problem. In Britain     percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re offend again within a year. Now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit  Forty three. And how many previous times do you think they've been in prison  Seven. So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice  and we said to the Ministry of Justice  what's it worth to you if fewer of these guys re offend  It's got to be worth something  right  I mean  there's prison costs  there's police costs  there's court costs  all these things that you're spending money on to deal with these guys. What's it worth  Now  of course  we care about the social value. Social Finance  the organization I helped set up  cares about social stuff. But we wanted to make the economic case  because if we could make the economic case  then the value of doing this  would be completely compelling. And if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we've been successful at reducing that re offending  then we can do something we think rather interesting. The idea is called the social impact bond. Now  the social impact bond is simply saying  if we can get the government to agree  that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked. So that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn't work  which for still quite a lot of bits of government  that's a serious issue. Now  many of you may have noticed there's a problem at this point  and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened. So we have to raise some money. We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors. Socially motivated investors  there's an interesting idea  right  But actually  there's a lot of people who  if they're given the chance  would love to invest in something that does social good. And here's the opportunity. Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model  not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re offend and putting them back in again  but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims  So we find some investors  and they pay for a set of services  and if those services are successful  then they improve outcomes  and with those measured reductions in re offending  government saves money  and with those savings  they can pay outcomes. And the investors do not just get their money back  but they make a return. So in March       we signed the first social impact bond with the Ministry of Justice around Peterborough Prison. It was to work with       offenders split into three cohorts of       each. Now  each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison. They've got to have a year to commit their crimes  six months to get through the court system  and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer  as similar as possible  and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of    percent reduction  for every conviction event that didn't happen. So we get paid for crimes saved. Now if we achieved that    percent reduction across all three cohorts  then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment  and if we do better than that  they can get up to    percent annualized return on their investment  which is okay. So everyone wins here  right  The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works. Investors get two opportunities  for the first time  they can invest in social change. Also  they make a reasonable return  and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things  they're going to have to believers. They're going to have to care in the social program  but if this builds a track record over five or    years  then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product. The service providers  well  for the first time  they've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they're doing over five or six years  not just one or two as often happens at the moment. Society wins  fewer crimes  fewer victims. Now  the offenders  they also benefit. Instead of just coming out of the prison with    pounds in their pocket  half of them not knowing where they're spending their first night out of jail  actually  someone meets them in prison  learns about their issues  meets them at the gate  takes them through to somewhere to stay  connects them to benefits  connects them to employment  drug rehabilitation  mental health  whatever's needed. So let's think of another example  working with children in care. Social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people. So children in the state care tend to do very badly. Only    percent achieve a reasonable level of five GCSEs at     against    percent of the wider population. More troublingly     percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care. And even more worryingly  and this is a Home Office statistic     percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care. The state is not a great parent. But there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care  and    percent of kids going into care are adolescents. So we set up a program with Essex County Council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system. Essex only pays in the event that it's saving them care costs. Investors have put in  .  million pounds. That program started last month. Others  around homelessness in London  around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country. There are now    social impact bonds in Britain  and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world. So David Cameron's put    million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea. Obama has suggested     million dollars in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward  and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest. So what's caused this excitement  Why is this so different for people  Well  the first piece  which we've talked about  is innovation. It enables testing of new ideas in a way that's less difficult for everybody. The second piece it brings is rigor. By working to outcomes  people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one's dealing with. So taking Peterborough as an example  we add case management across all of the different organizations that we're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners  and at the same time they learn from the Ministry of Justice  and we learn  because we pushed for the data  what actually happens  whether they get re arrested or not. And we learn and adapt the program accordingly. And this leads to the third element  which is new  and that's flexibility. Because normal contracting for things  when you're spending government money  you're spending our money  tax money  and the people who are in charge  of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it. Now any entrepreneur in the room knows that version  .   the business plan  is not the one that generally works. So when you're trying to do something like this  you need the flexibility to adapt the program. And again  in Peterborough  we started off with a program  but we also collected data  and over the period of time  we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements  so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term  greater engagement from the prisoners  longer term engagement as well. The last element is partnership. There is  at the moment  a stale  debate going on very often  state's better  public sector's better  private sector's better  social sector's better  for a lot of these programs. Actually  for creating social change  we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work. And this creates a structure through which they can combine. So where does this leave us  This leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change. We've met thousands  possibly millions of people  who want the opportunity to invest in social change. We've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences. With this kind of model  we can help bring them together. Thank you. We have a global health challenge in our hands today  and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly  takes far too long  and it fails more often than it succeeds. It really just isn't working  and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them  and diseases are going untreated. We seem to be spending more and more money. So for every billion dollars we spend in R D  we're getting less drugs approved into the market. More money  less drugs. Hmm. So what's going on here  Well  there's a multitude of factors at play  but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work  whether it has efficacy  or whether it's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials  are failing us. They're not predicting what's going to happen in humans. And we have two main tools available at our disposal. They are cells in dishes and animal testing. Now let's talk about the first one  cells in dishes. So  cells are happily functioning in our bodies. We take them and rip them out of their native environment  throw them in one of these dishes  and expect them to work. Guess what. They don't. They don't like that environment because it's nothing like what they have in the body. What about animal testing  Well  animals do and can provide extremely useful information. They teach us about what happens in the complex organism. We learn more about the biology itself. However  more often than not  animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they're treated with a particular drug. So we need better tools. We need human cells  but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body. Our bodies are dynamic environments. We're in constant motion. Our cells experience that. They're in dynamic environments in our body. They're under constant mechanical forces. So if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies  we need to become cell architects. We need to design  build and engineer a home away from home for the cells. And at the Wyss Institute  we've done just that. We call it an organ on a chip. And I have one right here. It's beautiful  isn't it  But it's pretty incredible. Right here in my hand is a breathing  living human lung on a chip. And it's not just beautiful. It can do a tremendous amount of things. We have living cells in that little chip  cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types. There's been many people trying to grow cells in the lab. They've tried many different approaches. They've even tried to grow little mini organs in the lab. We're not trying to do that here. We're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry  the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies. So how does it work  Let me show you. We use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment. We have three fluidic channels. In the center  we have a porous  flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from  say  our lungs  and then underneath  they had capillary cells  the cells in our blood vessels. And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane  so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe. And they experience them how they did in the body. There's air flowing through the top channel  and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel. Now the chip is really beautiful  but what can we do with it  We can get incredible functionality inside these little chips. Let me show you. We could  for example  mimic infection  where we add bacterial cells into the lung. then we can add human white blood cells. White blood cells are our body's defense against bacterial invaders  and when they sense this inflammation due to infection  they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria. Well now you're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip. We've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through  and when they detect that infection  they begin to stick. They stick  and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel. And you can see here  we can actually visualize a single white blood cell. It sticks  it wiggles its way through between the cell layers  through the pore  comes out on the other side of the membrane  and right there  it's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green. In that tiny chip  you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection. It's the way we respond to    an immune response. It's pretty exciting. Now I want to share this picture with you  not just because it's so beautiful  but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips. It tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs  actually have these hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung. These structures are called cilia  and they actually move the mucus out of the lung. Yeah. Mucus. Yuck. But mucus is actually very important. Mucus traps particulates  viruses  potential allergens  and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out. When they get damaged  say  by cigarette smoke for example  they don't work properly  and they can't clear that mucus out. And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis. Cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis. But now  with the functionality that we get in these chips  we can begin to look for potential new treatments. We didn't stop with the lung on a chip. We have a gut on a chip. You can see one right here. And we've put intestinal human cells in a gut on a chip  and they're under constant peristaltic motion  this trickling flow through the cells  and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine. Now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. This is a disease that affects a large number of individuals. It's really debilitating  and there aren't really many good treatments for it. Now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs. Now  the true power of this technology  however  really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them. There's fluid flowing across these cells  so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together to form what we call a virtual human on a chip. Now we're really getting excited. We're not going to ever recreate  a whole human in these chips  but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what's going to happen in humans. For example  now we can begin to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug. Those of you like me who have asthma  when you take your inhaler  we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs  how it enters the body  how it might affect  say  your heart. Does it change the beating of your heart  Does it have a toxicity  Does it get cleared by the liver  Is it metabolized in the liver  Is it excreted in your kidneys  We can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug. This could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry  but a whole host of different industries  including the cosmetics industry. We can potentially use the skin on a chip that we're currently developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you're using are actually  safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing. We could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment  such as chemicals in regular household cleaners. We could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure. We could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as SARS. Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future. Right now  the average participant in a clinical trial is that  average. Tends to be middle aged  tends to be female. You won't find many clinical trials in which children are involved  yet every day  we give children medications  and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults. Children are not adults. They may not respond in the same way adults do. There are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction. Now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations  put them on chips  and create populations on a chip. This could really change the way we do clinical trials. And this is the team and the people that are doing this. We have engineers  we have cell biologists  we have clinicians  all working together. We're really seeing something quite incredible at the Wyss Institute. It's really a convergence of disciplines  where biology is influencing the way we design  the way we engineer  the way we build. It's pretty exciting. We're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise in large scale digital manufacturing. They're going to help us make  instead of one of these  millions of these chips  so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible. And this is key to the potential of that technology. Now let me show you our instrument. This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab  and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link    or more organ chips together. It does something else that's very important. It creates an easy user interface. So a cell biologist like me can come in  take a chip  put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there  put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a C.D.  and away you go. Plug and play. Easy. Now  let's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip  or your stem cells and put them on a chip. It would be a personalized chip just for you. Now all of us in here are individuals  and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs. I myself  a couple of years back  had a really bad headache  just couldn't shake it  thought    Well  I'll try something different.  I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later  I was on my way to the emergency room with a full blown asthma attack. Now  obviously it wasn't fatal  but unfortunately  some of these adverse drug reactions can be fatal. So how do we prevent them  Well  we could imagine one day having Geraldine on a chip  having Danielle on a chip  having you on a chip. Personalized medicine. Thank you. So when I do my job  people hate me. In fact  the better I do my job  the more people hate me. And no  I'm not a meter maid  and I'm not an undertaker. I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News.  Applause  So y'all heard that  right  Just to make sure  right  I am a gay talking head on Fox News. I am going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I've learned. So I go on television. I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in  in some cases  who don't want me and people like me to even exist. It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids  with a live television audience of millions. It's totally almost just like that. And that's just on air. The hate mail I get is unbelievable. Last week alone  I got     pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count. I was called an idiot  a traitor  a scourge  a cunt  and an ugly man  and that was just in one email. So what have I realized  being on the receiving end of all this ugliness  Well  my biggest takeaway is that for decades  we've been focused on political correctness  but what matters more is emotional correctness. Let me give you a small example. I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't. I care about two things. One  I care that you spell it right. Just quick refresher  it's D Y K E. You'd totally be surprised. And second  I don't care about the word  I care about how you use it. Are you being friendly  Are you just being naive  Or do you really want to hurt me personally  Emotional correctness is the tone  the feeling  how we say what we say  the respect and compassion we show one another. And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data. Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct. So when I first went to go work at Fox News  true confession  I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging. That  by the way  in case you're paying attention  is not emotionally correct. But liberals on my side  we can be self righteous  we can be condescending  we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us. In other words  we can be politically right but emotionally wrong. And incidentally  that means that people don't like us. Right  Now here's the kicker. Conservatives are really nice. I mean  not all of them  and not the ones who send me hate mail  but you would be surprised. Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates  and I know that if I ever had a problem  he would do anything he could to help. Now  I think Sean Hannity is    percent politically wrong  but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive  and that's why people listen to him. Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first. We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements  and if we can start to find compassion for one another  then we have a shot at building common ground. It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here  but when you try to put it in practice  it's really powerful. So someone who says they hate immigrants  I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known. Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions  I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter  and they're just looking for someone to blame. Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us. That is emotional correctness. I'm not saying it's easy. An average of  like   .  times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities. This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political spiritual practice for me  and I ain't the Dalai Lama. I'm not perfect  but what I am is optimistic  because I don't just get hate mail. I get a lot of really nice letters  lots of them. And one of my all time favorites begins   I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic  but I'm a big fan of you as a person.  Now this guy doesn't agree with me  yet. But he's listening  not because of what I said  but because of how I said it  and somehow  even though we've never met  we've managed to form a connection. That's emotional correctness  and that's how we start the conversations that really lead to change. Thank you. So this video was taken at Aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of Key Largo  about    feet below the surface. NASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts  and last year  they invited us along for the ride. All the footage was taken from our open ROV  which is a robot that we built in our garage. So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle  which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra thin tether back to the computer topside. It's open source  meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online  allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design. It's built with mostly off the shelf parts and costs about       times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic. So ROVs aren't new. They've been around for decades. Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans. Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction. What we've built isn't unique. It's how we've built it that's really unique. So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started. So a few years ago  my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras. We had heard this story about lost gold from a Gold Rush era robbery  and we wanted to go up there. Unfortunately  we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it. So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot  but we didn't have all the parts figured out  so we did what anybody would do in our situation  we asked the Internet for help. More specifically  we created this website  openROV.com  and shared  our intentions and our plans For the first few months  it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums  but pretty soon  we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists  and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. We kept working on it. We learned a lot. We kept prototyping  and eventually  we decided we wanted to go  to the cave. We were ready. So about that time  our little expedition became quite a story  and it got picked up in The New York Times. And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves. So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter  and when we did  we raised our funding goal in about two hours  and all of a sudden   had this money to make these kits. But then we had to learn how to make them. I mean  we had to learn small batch manufacturing. So we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. But we were able to do it  we got all the kits made  thanks a lot to TechShop  which was a big help to us  and we shipped these kits all over the world just before Christmas of last year  so it was just a few months ago. But we're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world  including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica. We've also learned the penguins love robots. So we're still publishing all the designs online  encouraging anyone to build these themselves. That's the only way that we could have done this. By being open source  we've created this distributed R D network  and we're moving faster than any venture backed counterpart. But the actual robot is really only half the story. The real potential  the long term potential  is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas  So you're probably all wondering  the cave. Did you find the gold  Well  we didn't find any gold  but we decided that what we found was much more valuable. It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration. It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world  but something that we're all participating in. It's an underwater world we're all exploring together. Thank you. Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge  because different from health or education or housing  it tends to get worse as societies become richer. Clearly  a unsustainable model. Mobility  as most other developing country problems  more than a matter of money or technology  is a matter of equality  equity. The great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see  for example  that in terms of transport  an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars  but rather one where even the rich use public transport. Or bicycles  For example  in Amsterdam  more than    percent of the population uses bicycles  despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the United States. There is a conflict in developing world cities for money  for government investment. If more money is invested in highways  of course there is less money for housing  for schools  for hospitals  and also there is a conflict for space. There is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them. Most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage most of society's resources. However  there is a problem with that  that market economy needs inequality of income in order to work. Some people must make more money  some others less. Some companies succeed. Others fail. Then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy  I would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities. The first one is equality of quality of life  especially for children  that all children should have  beyond the obvious health and education  access to green spaces  to sports facilities  to swimming pools  to music lessons. And the second kind of equality is one which we could call  democratic equality.  The first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law. That is not just poetry. It's a very powerful principle. For example  if that is true  a bus with    passengers has a right to    times more road space than a car with one. We have been so used to inequality  sometimes  that it's before our noses and we do not see it. Less than     years ago  women could not vote  and it seemed normal  in the same way that it seems normal today to see a bus in traffic. In fact  when I became mayor  applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest  that a bus with     people has a right to     times more road space than a car  we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes. We called it TransMilenio  in order to make buses sexier. And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol  because as buses zoom by  expensive cars stuck in traffic  it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work. In fact  it's not just a matter of equity. It doesn't take Ph.D.'s. A committee of    year old children would find out in    minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses. In fact  buses are not sexy  but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities. They also have great capacity. For example  this system in Guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China  except for one line in Beijing  at a fraction of the cost. We fought not just for space for buses  but we fought for space for people  and that was even more difficult. Cities are human habitats  and we humans are pedestrians. Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run  we need to walk. There is a really enormous conflict  when we are talking about developing country cities  between pedestrians and cars. Here  what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy. What this shows is that people who walk are third class citizens while those who go in cars are first class citizens. In terms of transport infrastructure  what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks. Here they made a flyover  probably very useless  and they forgot to make a sidewalk. This is prevailing all over the world. Not even schoolchildren are more important than cars. In my city of Bogot   we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars  which had been parking on sidewalks for decades  in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings  and to make space for protected bikeways. First of all  I had black hair before that. And I was almost impeached in the process. It is a very difficult battle. However  it was possible  finally  after very difficult battles  to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity  that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars. Indeed  a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city  which is road space. A city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space. How to distribute it between pedestrians  bicycles  public transport and cars  This is not a technological issue  and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution. We also built  and this was    years ago  before there were bikeways in New York or in Paris or in London  it was a very difficult battle as well  more than     kilometers of protected bicycle ways. I don't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature. They are a right  just as sidewalks are  unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility  without the risk of getting killed. And just as busways are  protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy  because they show that a citizen on a     bicycle is equally important to one in a         car. And we are living in a unique moment in history. In the next    years  more than half of those cities which will exist in the year      will be built. In many developing country cities  more than    and    percent of the city which will exist in      will be built over the next four or five decades. But this is not just a matter for developing country cities. In the United States  for example  more than    million new homes must be built over the next    or    years. That's more than all the homes that today exist in Britain  France and Canada put together. And I believe that our cities today have severe flaws  and that different  better ones could be built. What is wrong with our cities today  Well  for example  if we tell any three year old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today   Watch out  a car   the child will jump in fright  and with a very good reason  because there are more than        children who are killed by cars every year in the world. We have had cities for       years  and children could walk out of home and play. In fact  only very recently  towards       there were no cars. Cars have been here for really less than     years. They completely changed cities. In       for example  nobody was killed by cars in the United States. Only    years later  between      and       almost         people were killed by cars in the United States. Only in       almost       children were killed by cars in the United States. So we could make different cities  cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars  that will give more public space to human beings than to cars  cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens  such as children or the elderly. I will propose to you a couple of ingredients which I think would make cities much better  and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created. Hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss crossing cities in all directions. Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces. They could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways  sort of bicycle highways  and I would invite you to imagine the following  a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles. In new cities which are going to be built  this would not be particularly difficult. When I was mayor of Bogot   in only three years  we were able to create    kilometers  in one of the most dense cities in the world  of these bicycle highways. And this changes the way people live  move  enjoy the city. In this picture  you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods  we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street  and the cars still in the mud. Of course  I would love to pave this street for cars. But what do we do first  Ninety nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars. But you see  when a city is only being created  it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure. Then the city grows around it. And of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it  and it changes the way of life. And the second ingredient  which would solve mobility  that very difficult challenge in developing countries  in a very low cost and simple way  would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses  buses and bicycles and pedestrians. This would be  again  a very low cost solution if implemented from the start  low cost  pleasant transit with natural sunlight. But unfortunately  reality is not as good as my dreams. Because of private property of land and high land prices  all developing country cities have a large problem of slums. In my country of Colombia  almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments. And of course it's very difficult to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments. But even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places  very far from the city centers where it's impossible to provide low cost  high frequency public transport. As a Latin American  and Latin America was the most recently organized region in the world  I would recommend  respectfully  passionately  to those countries which are yet to urbanize    Latin America went from    percent urban in      to    percent urban in         I would recommend Asian and African countries which are yet to urbanize  such as India which is only    percent urban now  that governments should acquire all land around cities. In this way  their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces  with the parks  with the greenways  with the busways. The cities we are going to build over the next    years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future. What a fantastic opportunity for leaders and many young leaders to come  especially in the developing countries. They can create a much happier life for billions towards the future. I am sure  I am optimistic  that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams. I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart  and so just before I get going  I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago. Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom. And so this talk is going to be for him. I grew up in wonder. I grew up amongst those animals. I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve. It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations. Now for as long as I can remember  my job has been to take people out into nature  and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering. Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories  and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories  stories about heroes of heart. Now my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news  and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place  I also know it to be a place where people  animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world. When I was nine years old  President Mandela came to stay with my family. He had just been released from his    years of incarceration  and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status. Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye  and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi. But it was a defining time for me as a young boy. I would take him breakfast in bed  and then  in an old track suit and slippers  he would go for a walk around the garden. At night  I would sit with my family around the snowy  bunny eared TV  and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly. He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa  one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity. Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think  to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa  peace  reconciliation  harmony. Through this act of immense open heartedness  he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call  ubuntu.  Ubuntu  I am because of you. Or  people are not people without other people. It's not a new idea or value but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on. In fact  it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa  we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others. Ubuntu is at play right now. You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am. Without you  I'm just a guy talking to an empty room  and I spent a lot of time last week doing that  and it's not the same as this. If Mandela was the national and international embodiment  then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man  Solly Mhlongo. Solly was born under a tree    kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique. He would never have a lot of money  but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet. Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle. Now  I can tell you  I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle  but it makes for  ber resourcefulness. The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks. Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea  but he could do it. He then moved across into what we called the habitat team. These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well being. He fixed roads  he mended wetlands  he did some anti poaching. And then one day we were out together  and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked. And it was an old track  but for fun he turned and he began to follow it  and I tell you  I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D. level tracker. If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve  you look up in your rearview mirror  you'd see he'd stopped the car        meters down the road just in case you need help with something. The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said   Solly  you are pathologically helpful.  When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment  Solly was my tracker. We worked together as a team. And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast  and they said to Solly  on the side  they said   Before we even go out to see lions and leopards  we want to see where you live.  So we took them up to his house  and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife  who was learning English  was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying   Hello  I love you. Welcome  I love you.   Laughter  And there was something so beautifully African about it to me  this small house with a huge heart in it. Now on the day that Solly saved my life  he was already my hero. It was a hot day  and we found ourselves down by the river. Because of the heat  I took my shoes off  and I rolled up my pants  and I walked into the water. Solly remained on the bank. The water was clear running over sand  and we turned and we began to make our way upstream. And a few meters ahead of us  there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank  and its branches were touching the water  and it was shadowy. And if had been a horror movie  people in the audience would have started saying   Don't go in there. Don't go in there.   Laughter  And of course  the crocodile was in the shadows. Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite. Wham  It hits me by my right leg. It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch. It's shaking me violently. It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you  and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that. Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble. He turns. He begins to make his way to me. The croc again continues to shake me. It goes to bite me a second time. I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream. As it bites the second time  I kick. My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out. I pull myself up into the branches  and as I come out of the water  I look over my shoulder. My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description. The bone is cracked. The meat is torn up. I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again. As I come out of the water  Solly arrives at a deep section  a channel between us. He knows  he sees the state of my leg  he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile  and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second. He comes straight into the channel. He wades in to above his waist. He gets to me. He grabs me. I'm still in a vulnerable position. He picks me and puts me on his shoulder. This is the other thing about Solly  he's freakishly strong. He turns. He walks me up the bank. He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off. He wraps it around my leg  picks me up a second time  walks me to a vehicle  and he's able to get me to medical attention. And I survive. Now    Applause  Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you  but for Solly  it was as natural as breathing. And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa. In a more collective society  we realize from the inside that our own well being is deeply tied to the well being of others. Danger is shared. Pain is shared. Joy is shared. Achievement is shared. Houses are shared. Food is shared. Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share  and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value  his animated  empathetic action in every moment. Now although the root word is about people  I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people. And then I met this young lady. Her name was Elvis. In fact  Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance. She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis. She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route. When I first saw her  I thought she would be dead in a matter of days. And yet  for the next five years she returned in the winter months. And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track. It looked like an inverted bracket  and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow  and then we would come around the corner  and there she would be with her herd. And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her  it was this sense of kinship. And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals. And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving. And then one day we came across them at this small water hole. It was sort of a hollow in the ground. And I watched as the matriarch drank  and then she turned in that  beautiful slow motion of elephants  looks like the arm in motion  and she began to make her way up the steep bank. The rest of the herd turned and began to follow. And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill. She got visibly    ears came forward  she had a full go of it and halfway up  her legs gave way  and she fell backwards. She attempted it a second time  and again  halfway up  she fell backwards. And on the third attempt  an amazing thing happened. Halfway up the bank  a young teenage elephant came in behind her  and he propped his trunk underneath her  and he began to shovel her up the bank. And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant. The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth  and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground. And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant. What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu  and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild  we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us. And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet. If Africa has a gift to share  it's a gift of a more collective society. And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea  what I see is the essence of that value being invented here. Thank you. Pat Mitchell  So Boyd  we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today  and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world. But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts  because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session. Boyd Varty  Well thanks  Pat. I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on. He was suffering. And so of course there's the mixed emotions. But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about. And she was like   Well  it'll be about you.  I mean  that's just incredible humility. He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa. And everything  they used to call it Madiba magic. You know  he used to go to a rugby match and we would win. Anywhere he went  things went well. But I think that magic will be with us  and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for. And so that's what I'm going to try and do  and that's what people all over  South Africa are trying to do. PM  And that's what you've done today. BV  Oh  thank you. PM  Thank you. BV  Thank you. Thanks very much. I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope. I am a native of Burkina Faso. According to the World Bank  Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world  but what does it look like to grow up in a place like that  I am an example of that. I was born in a little village called Gando. In Gando  there was no electricity  no access to clean drinking water  and no school. But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write. For this reason  I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family. In this place I sat in a class like that with more than     other kids  and for six years. In this time  it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died. Today  not so much has changed. There is still no electricity in my village. People still are dying in Burkina Faso  and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem. I had luck. I was lucky  because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that. But I was lucky. I had a scholarship. I could go to Germany to study. So now  I suppose  I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today. From Gando  my home village in Burkina Faso  to Berlin in Germany to become an architect is a big  big step. But what to do with this privilege  Since I was a student  I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gando. I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money  Oh yes  I started to make drawings and asked for money. Fundraising was not an easy task. I even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes  but to sponsor my school project. In real wonder  two years later  I was able to collect        U.S. dollars. When I came home to Gando to bring the good news  my people were over the moon  but when they realized that I was planning to use clay  they were shocked.  A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season  and Francis wants us to use it and build a school. Is this the reason why he spent so much time in Europe studying instead of working in the field with us   My people build all the time with clay  but they don't see any innovation with mud. So I had to convince everybody. I started to speak with the community  and I could convince everybody  and we could start to work. And the women  the men  everybody from the village  was part of this building process. I was allowed to use even traditional techniques. So clay floor for example  the young men come and stand like that  beating  hours for hours  and then their mothers came  and they are beating in this position  for hours  giving water and beating. And then the polishers come. They start polishing it with a stone for hours. And then you have this result  very fine  like a baby bottom. It's not photoshopped.  Laughter  This is the school  built with the community. The walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from Gando. The roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hiding inside concrete. And the classroom  the ceiling is made out of both of them used together. In this school  there was a simple idea  to create comfort in a classroom. Don't forget  it can be    degrees in Burkina Faso  so with simple ventilation  I wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning. And this is the project today     years old  still in best condition. And the kids  they love it. And for me and my community  this project was a huge success. It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando. So I could do a lot of projects  and here I am going to share with you only three of them. The first one is the school extension  of course. How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write  I started to build a prototype like that. The innovation was to build a clay vault. So then  I jumped on the top like that  with my team  and it works. The community is looking. It still works. So we can build.  Laughter  And we kept building  and that is the result. The kids are happy  and they love it. The community is very proud. We made it. And even animals  like these donkeys  love our buildings. The next project is the library in Gando. And see now  we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings  but we often don't have so much material. Something we have in Gando are clay pots. We wanted to use them to create openings. So we just bring them like you can see to the building site. we start cutting them  and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete  and you have this result. The openings are letting the hot air out and light in. Very simple. My most recent project in Gando is a high school project. I would like to share with you this. The innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete. How do you cast mud  We start making a lot of mortars  like you can see  and when everything is ready  when you know what is the best recipe and the best form  you start working with the community. And sometimes I can leave. They will do it themselves. I came to speak to you like that. Another factor in Gando is rain. When the rains come  we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain. Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne Claude. It is simply how we protect our walls. The rain in Burkina comes very fast  and after that  you have floods everywhere in the country. But for us  the rain is good. It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build. We just wait for the rain to go. We take the sand  we mix it with clay  and we keep building. That is it. The Gando project was always connected to training the people  because I just wanted  one day when I fall down and die  that at least one person from Gando keeps doing this work. But you will be surprised. I'm still alive. And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves. Usually  for a young man from Gando to earn money  you have to leave the country to the city  sometimes leave the country and some never come back  making the community weaker. But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. There's a new quality in this work. Yes  you know it. I have won a lot of awards through this work. For sure  it has opened opportunities. I have become myself known. But the reason why I do what I do is my community. When I was a kid  I was going to school  I was coming back every holiday to Gando. By the end of every holidays  I had to say goodbye to the community  going from one compound to another one. All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny. In my culture  this is a symbol of deep affection. As a seven year old guy  I was impressed. I just asked my mother one day   Why do all these women love me so much   She just answered   They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community.  I hope now that I was able to make my community proud through this work  and I hope I was able to prove you the power of community  and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future. Merci beaucoup.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So how many of you have ever been in a cave before  Okay  a few of you. When you think of a cave  most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock  and in fact  that's how most caves are. Around this half of the country  most of your caves are made of limestone. Back where I'm from  most of our  caves are made of lava rock  because we have a lot of volcanoes out there. But the caves I want to share  with you today are made completely of ice  specifically glacier ice that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon  called Mount Hood. Now Mount Hood's only  one hour's drive from Portland  the largest city in Oregon  where over two million people live. Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it. The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave. Now these days  with so many people hiking around  it's pretty hard to find a new cave  so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before. It was kind of like being an astronaut  because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before. So what is a glacier  Well  those of you who have ever seen or touched snow  you know that it's really light  because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together  and it's mostly air. If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball  it gets really small  hard and dense. Well  on a mountain like Hood  where it snows over    feet a year  it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice. Now each year  more and more ice stacks up on top of it  and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight  forming a slow moving river of ice. When ice packed like that starts to move  we call it a glacier  and we give it a name. The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier. Now each year  as new snow lands on the glacier  it melts in the summer sun  and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice  and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier  forming big networks of caves  sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock. Now the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year  new tunnels form. Different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave. Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down  and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up  gets into the cave  and melts the ceilings back taller and taller. But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving  because it's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain. Now this is Brent McGregor  my cave exploration partner. He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we've been climbing mountains a long time  but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before. Back in       Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves. There were no GPS coordinates for it  and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier. So in July of that year  we went out on the glacier  and we found a big crack in the ice. We had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole. This is me looking into the entrance crevasse. At the end of this hole  we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice. We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end  and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three dimensional map of the cave on our way back out. So how do you map a cave  Well  cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes  going to overlapping levels. To make a cave map  you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave  and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations. Then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings. Now those of you taking trigonometry  that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there. In fact  the more I mapped and studied caves  the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be. So when you're done surveying  you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well  and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this  and it'll show you both a bird's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage  kind of like an ant farm view. We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow. Now later this summer  as more snow melted off the glacier  we found more caves  and we realized they were all connected. Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon  Brent discovered this new cave not very far away. The inside of it was coated with ice  so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping. This cave was amazing. The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up. And we couldn't understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end and we found out why. There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going     feet straight up to the surface of the glacier. Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave  freezing everything inside of it. And we were so excited about finding this new pit  we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it. It was so cold outside  we actually had to sleep inside the cave. There's our camp on the left side  of this entrance room. The next morning  we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier  where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time. Brent named this cave Pure Imagination  I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined. So besides really cool ice  what else is inside these caves  Well not too much lives in them  because they're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year. But there are some really cool things in there. There's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice. In fact  this past summer  scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles  tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions  might be living under the ice  kind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of Mars someday. Another really cool things is that  as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die  they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier  sinking deeper and deeper into the ice. As these caves form and melt  their way up into the ice  they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor  where we end up finding them. For example  this is a noble fir seed we found. It's been frozen in the ice for over     years  and it's just now starting to sprout. This mallard duck feather was found over       feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave. This duck died on the surface of the glacier long  long ago  and its feathers have finally made it down through over     feet of ice before falling inside the cave. And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon. Even now  Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were  essentially in our own backyard  hidden away  just waiting to be found. Like I said earlier  the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something  you can only do with space travel now  but that's not true. Every year  new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before. So it's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself. You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it  because it might be in your own backyard. Thank you very much. I have a question  Who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die  I do. I was a young boy  and my grandfather had just died  and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened. What did it mean that he was dead  Where had he gone  It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him. But then the really shocking question occurred to me  If he could die  could it happen to me too  Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me  Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept  Well  at some point  all children become aware of death. It can happen in different ways  of course  and usually comes in stages. Our idea of death develops as we grow older. And if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory  you might remember something like what I felt when my grandfather died and when I realized it could happen to me too  that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting. And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species. Just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were mortal  so at some point in the evolution of our species  some early human's sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize   I'm going to die.  This is  if you like  our curse. It's the price we pay for being so damn clever. We have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will  the end of all our projects  our hopes  our dreams  of our individual world. We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse. And that's frightening. It's terrifying. And so we look for a way out. And in my case  as I was about five years old  this meant asking my mum. Now when I first started asking what happens when we die  the grown ups around me at the time answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness and half hearted Christianity  and the phrase I heard most often was that granddad was now  up there looking down on us   and if I should die too  which wouldn't happen of course  then I too would go up there  which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator. Now this didn't sound very plausible. I used to watch a children's news program at the time  and this was the era of space exploration. There were always rockets going up into the sky  up into space  going up there. But none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people. But I was scared  and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while I slept. And so I believed it anyway  even though it didn't make much sense. And this thought process that I went through as a child  and have been through many times since  including as a grown up  is a product of what psychologists call a bias. Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong  ways in which we miscalculate  misjudge  distort reality  or see what we want to see  and the bias I'm talking about works like this  Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn't true and they can  instead  live forever  even if it means taking the existential elevator. Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all. It has been demonstrated in over     empirical studies. Now these studies are ingenious  but they're simple. They work like this. You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects  and you remind one group that they're going to die but not the other  then you compare their behavior. So you're observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality. And every time  you get the same result  People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever. So here's an example  One recent study took two groups of agnostics  that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs. Now  one group was asked to think about being dead. The other group was asked to think about being lonely. They were then asked again about their religious beliefs. Those who had been asked to think about being dead were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in God and Jesus. Twice as likely. Even though the before they were all equally agnostic. But put the fear of death in them  and they run to Jesus. Now  this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe  regardless of the evidence  and it works not just for religion  but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form  whether it's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism  which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole. This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history. Now  the theory behind this bias in the over     studies is called terror management theory  and the idea is simple. It's just this. We develop our worldviews  that is  the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it  in order to help us manage the terror of death. And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations  but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take. And we can see them repeating themselves throughout history  just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day. Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story  and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they're retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day. Now  the first story is the simplest. We want to avoid death  and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story  and it might at first sound implausible  but actually  almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever. Ancient Egypt had such myths  ancient Babylon  ancient India. Throughout European history  we find them in the work of the alchemists  and of course we still believe this today  only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science. So     years ago  hormones had just been discovered  and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease  and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells  genetic engineering  and nanotechnology. But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir  a story that is as old as civilization. But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy. When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past  the one thing they now have in common is that they're all dead. So we need a backup plan  and exactly this kind of plan B is what the second kind of immortality story offers  and that's resurrection. And it stays with the idea that I am this body  I am this physical organism. It accepts that I'm going to have to die but says  despite that  I can rise up and I can live again. In other words  I can do what Jesus did. Jesus died  he was three days in the  tomb   and then he rose up and lived again. And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe  not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims. But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age  for example  with the idea of cryonics. That's the idea that when you die  you can have yourself frozen  and then  at some point when technology has advanced enough  you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected. And so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again  and other people believe an  omnipotent scientist will do it. But for others  the whole idea of resurrection  of climbing out of the grave  it's just too much like a bad zombie movie. They find the body too messy  too unreliable to guarantee eternal life  and so they set their hopes on the third  more spiritual immortality story  the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul. Now  the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul  and the idea is central to many religions. But even though  in its current form  in its traditional form  the idea of the soul is still hugely popular  nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age  for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind  your essence  the real you  onto a computer  and so live on as an avatar in the ether. But of course there are skeptics who say if we look at the evidence of science  particularly neuroscience  it suggests that your mind  your essence  the real you  is very much dependent on a particular part of your body  that is  your brain. And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story  and that is legacy  the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world  like the great Greek warrior Achilles  who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame. And the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was  and in our digital age  it's even easier to achieve. You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles or a great king or hero. All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat.  Laughter  But some people prefer to leave a more tangible  biological legacy    children  for example. Or they like  they hope  to live on as part of some greater whole  a nation or a family or a tribe  their gene pool. But again  there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality. Woody Allen  for example  who said   I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen. I want to live on in my apartment.  So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories  and I've tried to give just some sense of how they're retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day. And the fact that they recur in this way  in such a similar form but in such different belief systems  suggests  I think  that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories. The fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this on the strength of the evidence. Rather  we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them  and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death. So the question is  are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial  or can we overcome this bias  Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could. He argued that the fear of death is natural  but it is not rational.  Death   he said   is nothing to us  because when we are here  death is not  and when death is here  we are gone.  Now this is often quoted  but it's difficult to really grasp  to really internalize  because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine. So       years later  another philosopher  Ludwig Wittgenstein  put it like this   Death is not an event in life  We do not live to experience death. And so   he added   in this sense  life has no end.  So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void  but it wasn't rational  because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience. Now  overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us  yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational  and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us  then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives. Now  I find it helps to see life as being like a book  Just as a book is bounded by its covers  by beginning and end  so our lives are bounded by birth and death  and even though a book is limited by beginning and end  it can encompass distant landscapes  exotic figures  fantastic adventures. And even though a book is limited by beginning and end  the characters within it know no horizons. They only know the moments that make up their story  even when the book is closed. And so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page. Long John Silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of  Treasure Island.  And so it should be with us. Imagine the book of your life  its covers  its beginning and end  and your birth and your death. You can only know the moments in between  the moments that make up your life. It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers  whether before your birth or after your death. And you needn't worry how long the book is  or whether it's a comic strip or an epic. The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story. Thank you. A couple of years ago  Harvard Business School chose the best business model of that year. It chose Somali piracy. Pretty much around the same time  I discovered that there were     seafarers being held hostage on ships  often anchored just off the Somali coast in plain sight. And I learned these two facts  and I thought  what's going on in shipping  And I thought  would that happen in any other industry  Would we see     airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months  or a year  Would we see     Greyhound bus drivers  It wouldn't happen. So I started to get intrigued. And I discovered another fact  which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before at the age of       . That is how fundamentally  we still depend on shipping. Because perhaps the general public thinks of shipping as an old fashioned industry  something brought by sailboat with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows. But shipping isn't that. Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been. Shipping brings us    percent of world trade. Shipping has quadrupled in size since     . We are more dependent on it now than ever. And yet  for such an enormous industry    there are a         working vessels on the sea   it's become pretty much invisible. Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that  because here shipping is so present that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel. But elsewhere in the world  if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea  you will get essentially a blank face. You will ask someone on the street if they've heard of Microsoft. I should think they'll say yes  because they'll know that they make software that goes on computers  and occasionally works. But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk  I doubt you'd get the same response  even though Maersk  which is just one shipping company amongst many  has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.     .  billion  Now why is this  A few years ago  the first sea lord of the British admiralty    he is called the first sea lord  although the chief of the army is not called a land lord   he said that we  and he meant in the industrialized nations in the West  that we suffer from sea blindness. We are blind to the sea as a place of industry or of work. It's just something we fly over  a patch of blue on an airline map. Nothing to see  move along. So I wanted to open my own eyes to my own sea blindness  so I ran away to sea. A couple of years ago  I took a passage on the Maersk Kendal  a mid sized container ship carrying nearly       boxes  and I departed from Felixstowe  on the south coast of England  and I ended up right here in Singapore five weeks later  considerably less jet lagged than I am right now. And it was a revelation. We traveled through five seas  two oceans  nine ports  and I learned a lot about shipping. And one of the first things that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was  where are all the people  I have friends in the Navy who tell me they sail with       sailors at a time  but on Kendal there were only    crew. Now that's because shipping is very efficient. Containerization has made it very efficient. Ships have automation now. They can operate with small crews. But it also means that  in the words of a port chaplain I once met  the average seafarer you're going to find on a container ship is either tired or exhausted  because the pace of modern shipping is quite punishing for what the shipping calls its human element  a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize sounds a little bit inhuman. So most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time. They don't have time to relax. They're at sea for months at a time  and even when they're on board  they don't have access to what a five year old would take for granted  the Internet. And another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was who I was sitting next to    Not the queen  I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait    But around that dining table in the officer's saloon  I was sitting next to a Burmese guy  I was opposite a Romanian  a Moldavian  an Indian. On the next table was a Chinese guy  and in the crew room  it was entirely Filipinos. So that was a normal working ship. Now how is that possible  Because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last    years  when most of the general public stopped noticing it  was something called an open registry  or a flag of convenience. Ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry. You can get a flag from the landlocked nation of Bolivia  or Mongolia  or North Korea  though that's not very popular. So we have these very multinational  global  mobile crews on ships. And that was a surprise to me. And when we got to pirate waters  down the Bab el Mandeb strait and into the Indian Ocean  the ship changed. And that was also shocking  because suddenly  I realized  as the captain said to me  that I had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship. We were no longer allowed on deck. There were double pirate watches. And at that time  there were those      seafarers being held hostage  and some of them were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience. Not all of them  but some of them were  because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners  it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience. What else does our sea blindness mask  Well  if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship  and look up to the funnel  you'll see very black smoke. And that's because shipping has very tight margins  and they want cheap fuel  so they use something called bunker fuel  which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery  or just one step up from asphalt. And shipping is the greenest method of transport. In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile  it emits about a thousandth of aviation and about a tenth of trucking. But it's not benign  because there's so much of it. So shipping emissions are about three to four percent  almost the same as aviation's. And if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries' carbon emissions  it would come in about sixth  somewhere near Germany. It was calculated in      that the    largest ships pollute in terms of particles and soot and noxious gases as much as all the cars in the world. And the good news is that people are now talking about sustainable shipping. There are interesting initiatives going on. But why has it taken so long  When are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles  I also traveled to Cape Cod to look at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale  because this to me was one of the most surprising things about my time at sea  and what it made me think about. We know about man's impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing  but we don't really know much about what's happening underneath the water. And in fact  shipping has a role to play here  because shipping noise has contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures. Light doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water  so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even     species of fish communicate by sound. And a North Atlantic right whale can transmit across hundreds of miles. A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean. But a supertanker can also be heard coming across a whole ocean  and because the noise that propellers make underwater is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use  then it can damage their acoustic habitat  and they need this for breeding  for finding feeding grounds  for finding mates. And the acoustic habitat of the North Atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to    percent. But there are no laws governing  acoustic pollution yet. And when I arrived in Singapore  and I apologize for this  but I  didn't want to get off my ship. I'd really loved being on board Kendal. I'd been well treated by the crew  I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain  and I would happily have signed up for another five weeks  something that the captain also said I was crazy to think about. But I wasn't there for nine months at a time like the Filipino seafarers  who  when I asked them to describe their job to me  called it  dollar for homesickness.  They had good salaries  but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element. But when I get to this part  I'm in two minds  because I want to salute those seafarers who bring us    percent of everything and get very little thanks or recognition for it. I want to salute the         ships that are at sea that are doing that work  coming in and out every day  bringing us what we need. But I also want to see shipping  and us  the general public  who know so little about it  to have a bit more scrutiny  to be a bit more transparent  to have    percent transparency. Because I think we could all benefit from doing something very simple  which is learning to see the sea. Thank you. By       Detroit had become the poster child for an American city in crisis. There was a housing collapse  an auto industry collapse  and the population had plummeted by    percent between      and       and many people were beginning to write it off  as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities. By       I had also been asked by the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future. I come to this work as an architect and an urban planner  and I've spent my career working in other contested cities  like Chicago  my hometown  Harlem  which is my current home  Washington  D.C.  and Newark  New Jersey. All of these cities  to me  still had a number of unresolved issues related to urban justice  issues of equity  inclusion and access. Now by       as well  popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like Detroit  and devoting whole issues to  fixing the city.  I was asked by a good friend  Fred Bernstein  to do an interview for the October issue of Architect magazine  and he and I kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title   Can This Planner Save Detroit   So I'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now  because obviously  it's completely absurd that a single person  let alone a planner  could save a city. But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession could play a role in helping the city to think about how it would recover from its severe crisis. So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city  a little bit about Detroit  and I want to do that through the voices of Detroiters. So we began our process in September of     . It's just after a special mayoral election  and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide planning process  which brings a lot of anxiety and fears among Detroiters. We had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process  and people came out from all over the city  including areas that were stable neighborhoods  as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy. And most of our audience was representative of the    percent African American population in the city at that time. So obviously  we have a Q A portion of our program  and people line up to mics to ask questions. Many of them step very firmly to the mic  put their hands across their chest  and go   I know you people are trying to move me out of my house  right   So that question is really powerful  and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment  when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had  and actually a lot of African Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit. Many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great grandparents  who were one of  .  million people who migrated from the rural South to the industrial North  as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence   The Great Migration.  They came to Detroit for a better way of life. Many found work in the automobile industry  the Ford Motor Company  as depicted in this mural by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art. The fruits of their labors would afford them a home  for many the first piece of property that they would ever know  and a community with other first time African American home buyers. The first couple of decades of their life in the North is quite well  up until about       which coincides with the city's peak population at  .  million people. Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see a second kind of migration  a migration to the suburbs. Between      and       the region grows by    percent. But this time  the migration leaves African Americans in place  as families and businesses flee the city  leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs. During that same period  between      and             the city loses    percent of its population  and today it hovers at above        . The audience members who come and talk to us that night tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city with such depleted population. Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes on their block that are occupied  and that they can see several abandoned homes from where they sit on their porches. Citywide  there are        vacant homes. They can also see vacant property. They're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties  like illegal dumping  and they know that because the city has lost so much population  their costs for water  electricity  gas are rising  because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need. Citywide  there are about         vacant parcels. Now  to quickly give you all a sense of a scale  because I know that sounds like a big number  but I don't think you quite understand until you look at the city map. So the city is     square miles. You can fit Boston  San Francisco  and the island of Manhattan within its footprint. So if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together  it looks like about    square miles  and that's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we're sitting on today  Manhattan  at    square miles. So it's a lot of vacancy. Now some of our audience members also tell us about some of the positive things that are happening in their communities  and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots  and they're starting community gardens  which are creating a great sense of community stewardship  but they're very  very clear to tell us that this is not enough  that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them. Now there's been a lot of speculation since      about what to do with the vacant property  and a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening  or what we call urban agriculture. So many people would say to us   What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland  It can provide fresh foods  and it can put Detroiters back to work too.  When I hear that story  I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration rolling over in their graves  because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice moving from the South to the North to create a better life for their families  only to see their great grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle  especially in a city where they came with little less than a high school education or even a grammar school education and were able to afford the basic elements of the American dream  steady work and a home that they owned. Now  there's a third wave of migration happening in Detroit  a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs. These folks see that same vacant land and those same abandoned homes as opportunity for new  entrepreneurial ideas and profit  so much so that former models can move to Detroit  buy property  start successful businesses and restaurants  and become successful community activists in their neighborhood  bringing about very positive change. Similarly  we have small manufacturing companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city. This company  Shinola  which is a luxury watch and bicycle company  deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit  and they quote themselves by saying they were drawn to the global brand  of Detroit's innovation. And they also knew that  they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things. Now we have community stewardship happening in neighborhoods  we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises  and we have businesses relocating  and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all  a city that's under the control of an emergency manager  and just this July filed for Chapter   bankruptcy. So       we started this process  and by       we released Detroit Future City  which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence    not what it was  but what it could be  looking at new ways of economic growth  new forms of land use  more sustainable and denser neighborhoods  a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system  and a heightened capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change. Three key imperatives were really important to our work. One was that the city itself wasn't necessarily too large  but the economy was too small. There are only    jobs per     people in Detroit  very different from a Denver or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia that are anywhere between     to    jobs per     people. Secondly  there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come. It wasn't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before  and urban agriculture  while a very productive and successful intervention happening in Detroit  was not the only answer  that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population of what could be new  productive  innovative  and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities  where still nearly         residents lived. So we came up with one neighborhood typology    there are several    called a live make neighborhood  where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises  with a specific emphasis on looking at the  again  majority    percent African American population. So they  too  could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided. Then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses  so that it could be used for storm water management  for example  by using surface lakes and retention ponds  that created neighborhood amenities  places of recreation  and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels. Or we could use it as research plots  where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils  or we could use it to generate energy. So the descendants of the Great Migration could either become precision watchmakers at Shinola  like Willie H.  who was featured in one of their ads last year  or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like Shinola. The good news is  there is a future for the next generation of Detroiters  both those there now and those that want to come. So no thank you  Mayor Menino  who recently was quoted as saying   I'd blow up the place and start over.  There are very important people  business and land assets in Detroit  and there are real opportunities there. So while Detroit might not be what it was  Detroit will not die. Thank you. Einstein said that  I never think about the future   it comes soon enough.  And he was right  of course. So today  I'm here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now. Over the past     years  the world has experienced two major waves of innovation. First  the Industrial Revolution brought us machines and factories  railways  electricity  air travel  and our lives have never been the same. Then the Internet revolution brought us computing power  data networks  unprecedented access to information and communication  and our lives have never been the same. Now we are experiencing another metamorphic change  the industrial Internet. It brings together intelligent machines  advanced analytics  and the creativity of people at work. It's the marriage of minds and machines. And our lives will never be the same. In my current role  I see up close how technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our economy and in our lives  energy  aviation  transportation  health care. For an economist  this is highly unusual  and it's extremely exciting  because this is a transformation as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more  and before the Industrial Revolution  there was no economic growth to speak of. So what is this industrial Internet  Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see  hear  feel a lot more than ever before  generating prodigious amounts of data. Increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data  providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways  a lot more efficiently. And not just individual machines  but fleets of locomotives  airplanes  entire systems like power grids  hospitals. It is asset optimization and system optimization. Of course  electronic sensors have been around for some time  but something has changed  a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and  thanks to advances in cloud computing  a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data. So we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent  they are brilliant. They are self aware  they are predictive  reactive and social. It's jet engines  locomotives  gas turbines  medical devices  communicating seamlessly with each other and with us. It's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it. We are beginning to deploy throughout the industrial system embedded virtualization  multi core processor technology  advanced cloud based communications  a new software defined machine infrastructure which allows machine functionality to become virtualized in software  decoupling machine software from hardware  and allowing us to remotely and automatically monitor  manage and upgrade industrial assets. Why does any of this matter at all  Well first of all  it's already allowing us to shift towards preventive  condition based maintenance  which means fixing machines just before they break  without wasting time servicing them on a fixed schedule. And this  in turn  is pushing us towards zero unplanned downtime  which means there will be no more power outages  no more flight delays. So let me give you a few examples of how these brilliant machines work  and some of the examples may seem trivial  some are clearly more profound  but all of them are going to have a very powerful impact. Let's start with aviation. Today     percent of all flights cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events. Something goes wrong unexpectedly. This results in eight billion dollars in costs for the airline industry globally every year  not to mention the impact on all of us  stress  inconvenience  missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal. So how can the industrial Internet help here  We've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft. It's self learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss. The aircraft  while in flight  will communicate with technicians on the ground. By the time it lands  they will already know if anything needs to be serviced. Just in the U.S.  a system like this can prevent over        delays and cancellations every year  helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time. Or take healthcare. Today  nurses spend an average of    minutes per shift looking for medical equipment. That seems trivial  but it's less time spent caring for patients. St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston  Texas  which has deployed industrial Internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients  staff and medical equipment  has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour. If you need surgery  one hour matters. It means more patients can be treated  more lives can be saved. Another medical center  in Washington state  is piloting an application that allows medical images from city scanners and MRIs to be analyzed in the cloud  developing better analytics at a lower cost. Imagine a patient who has suffered a severe trauma  and needs the attention of several specialists  a neurologist  a cardiologist  an orthopedic surgeon. If all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken  they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster. So all of this translates into better health outcomes  but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits. Just a one percent reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over    billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide  and that is just a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis. Similar advances are happening in energy  including renewable energy. Wind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way  depending on how the wind is blowing  can now produce electricity at a cost of less than five cents per kilowatt hour. Ten years ago  that cost was    cents  six times as much. The list goes on  and it will grow fast  because industrial data are now growing exponentially. By       they will account for over    percent of all digital information. But this is not just about data  so let me switch gears and tell you how this is impacting already the jobs we do every day  because this new wave of innovation is bringing about new tools and applications that will allow us to collaborate in a smarter and faster way  making our jobs not just more efficient but more rewarding. Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm with a handheld device telling her which turbines need servicing. She already has all the spare parts  because the problems were diagnosed in advanced. And if she faces an unexpected issue  the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center  let them see what she sees  transmit data that they can run through diagnostics  and they can stream videos that will guide her  step by step  through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running. And their interaction gets documented and stored in a searchable database. Let's stop and think about this for a minute  because this is a very important point. This new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work. And I know that many of you will be concerned  about the impact that innovation might have on jobs. Unemployment is already high  and there is always a fear  that innovation will destroy jobs. And innovation is disruptive. But let me stress two things here. First  we've already lived through mechanization of agriculture  automation of industry  and employment has gone up  because innovation is fundamentally about growth. It makes products more affordable. It creates new demand  new jobs. Second  there is a concern that in the future  there will only be room for engineers  data scientists  and other highly specialized workers. And believe me  as an economist  I am also scared. But think about it  Just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad  so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man than the Charlie Chaplin of  Modern Times.  And to be sure  new high skilled jobs will be created  mechanical digital engineers who understand both the machines and the data  managers who understand their industry and the analytics and can reorganize the business to take full advantage of the technology. But now let's take a step back. Let's look at the big picture. There are people who argue that today's innovation is all about social media and silly games  with nowhere near the transformational power of the Industrial Revolution. They say that all the growth enhancing innovations are behind us. And every time I hear this  I can't help thinking that even back in the Stone Age  there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy  and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill  and saying to each other   Yeah  this wheel thing  cool toy  sure  but compared to fire  it will have no impact. The big discoveries are all behind us.  This technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational as anything we have ever seen. Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward. They've created jobs. They've raised living standards. They've made our lives healthier and more rewarding. And the new wave of innovation which is beginning to sweep through industry is no different. In the U.S. alone  the industrial Internet could raise average income by    to    percent over the next    years  boosting growth to rates we haven't seen in a long time  and adding between    and    trillion dollars to global GDP. That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today. But this is not a foregone conclusion. We are just at the beginning of this transformation  and there will be barriers to break  obstacles to overcome. We will need to invest in the new technologies. We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices. We will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. And the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills. It's not going to be easy  but it is going to be worth it. The economic challenges facing us are hard  but when I walk the factory floor  and I see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected  and I see the difference this makes in a hospital  in an airport  in a power generation plant  I'm not just optimistic  I'm enthusiastic. This new technological revolution is upon us. So think about the future   it will be here soon enough. Thank you.  I felt a Funeral  in my Brain  and Mourners to and fro kept treading    treading    till  it seemed  that Sense was breaking through    And when they all were seated  a Service  like a Drum    kept beating    beating    till I  thought  my Mind was going numb    And then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul with those same Boots of Lead  again  then Space    began to toll  As  all  the Heavens were a Bell  and Being   but  an Ear  and I  and Silence  some strange Race  wrecked  solitary  here     And  then a Plank in Reason  broke  and I fell down and down    and hit a World  at every plunge  and Finished knowing    then     We know depression through metaphors. Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language  Goya in an image. Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states. As for me  I had always thought myself tough  one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentration camp. In       I had a series of losses. My mother died  a relationship I'd been in ended  I moved back to the United States from some years abroad  and I got through all of those experiences intact. But in       three years later  I found myself losing interest in almost everything. I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do  and I didn't know why. The opposite of depression is not happiness  but vitality. And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment. Everything there was to do seemed like too much work. I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine  and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends  I would think   What a lot of people that is to have to call back.  Or I would decide I should have lunch  and then I would think  but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it  and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross. And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous. You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it's not a big deal  and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity. And then the anxiety set in. If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month  I would say   As long I know it'll be over in November  I can do it.  But if you said to me   You have to have acute anxiety for the next month   I would rather slit my wrist than go through it. It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you  but instead of lasting half a second  the way that does  it lasted for six months. It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of. And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive  and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people. And finally one day  I woke up and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke  because I lay in bed completely frozen  looking at the telephone  thinking   Something is wrong and I should call for help   and I couldn't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial. And finally  after four full hours of my lying and staring at it  the phone rang  and somehow I managed to pick it up  and it was my father  and I said   I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something.  The next day I started with the medications and the therapy. And I also started reckoning with this terrible question  If I'm not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp  then who am I  And if I have to take medication  is that medication making me more fully myself  or is it making me someone else  And how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else  I had two advantages as I went into the fight. The first is that I knew that  objectively speaking  I had a nice life  and that if I could only get well  there was something at the other end that was worth living for. And the other was that I had access to good treatment. But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed  and emerged and relapsed  and emerged and relapsed  and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever. And I thought   But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem  And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure   And I couldn't figure out which it was. And then I understood that actually  we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully. The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play  and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality. I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling. They're not very effective. They're extremely costly. They come with innumerable side effects. They're a disaster. But I am so grateful that I live now and not    years ago  when there would have been almost nothing to be done. I hope that    years hence  people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science. Depression is the flaw in love. If you were married to someone and thought   Well  if my wife dies  I'll find another one   it wouldn't be love as we know it. There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss  and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy. There are three things people tend to confuse  depression  grief and sadness. Grief is explicitly reactive. If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy  and then  six months later  you are still deeply sad  but you're functioning a little better  it's probably grief  and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure. If you experience a catastrophic loss  and you feel terrible  and six months later you can barely function at all  then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances. The trajectory tells us a great deal. People think of depression as being just sadness. It's much  much too much sadness  much too much grief at far too slight a cause. As I set out to understand depression  and to interview people who had experienced it  I found that there were people who seemed  on the surface  to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it. And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes. And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people. What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive  And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression. One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead  and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness  that this is a serious business. It's the leading disability worldwide  and people die of it every day. One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years  and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college  and then plummeted into a horrific depression. She had bipolar illness  or manic depression  as it was then known. And then she did very well for many years on lithium  and then eventually  she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it  and she had another psychosis  and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat in her parents' apartment  more or less catatonic  essentially without moving  day after day after day. And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later    she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins    when I interviewed her  she said   I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone ' over and over  to occupy my mind. I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying  which were  'You are nothing. You are nobody. You don't even deserve to live.' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself.  You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away  the veil of happiness  and that now you're seeing truly. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised  but it's difficult with depressives  because we believe we are seeing the truth. But the truth lies. I became obsessed with that sentence   But the truth lies.  And I discovered  as I talked to depressive people  that they have many delusional perceptions. People will say   No one loves me.  And you say   I love you  your wife loves you  your mother loves you.  You can answer that one pretty readily  at least for most people. But people who are depressed will also say   No matter what we do  we're all just going to die in the end.  Or they'll say   There can be no true communion between two human beings. Each of us is trapped in his own body.  To which you have to say   That's true  but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast.  A lot of the time  what they are expressing is not illness  but insight  and one comes to think what's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don't distract us very much. There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour  and at the end of the hour  they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed. The depressive group was usually accurate to within about    percent  and the non depressed people guessed between    and    times as many little monsters    as they had actually killed. A lot of people said  when I chose to write about my depression  that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet  to have people know. They said   Do people talk to you differently   I said   Yes  people talk to me differently. They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience  or their sister's experience  or their friend's experience. Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has. I went a few years ago to a conference  and on Friday of the three day conference  one of the participants took me aside  and she said   I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it  but I've been taking this medication  and I just wanted to ask you what you think   And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could. And then she said   You know  my husband would never understand this. He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense  so  you know  it's just between us.  And I said   Yes  that's fine.  On Sunday of the same conference  her husband took me aside  and he said   My wife wouldn't think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this  but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication  and I wondered what you think   They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom. And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems. But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy. Depression is so exhausting. It takes up so much of your time and energy  and silence about it  it really does make the depression worse. And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better. I'd started off as a medical conservative. I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked  it was clear what they were    there was medication  there were certain psychotherapies  there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment  and that everything else was nonsense. But then I discovered something. If you have brain cancer  and you say that standing on your head for    minutes every morning makes you feel better  it may make you feel better  but you still have brain cancer  and you'll still probably die from it. But if you say that you have depression  and standing on your head for    minutes every day makes you feel better  then it's worked  because depression is an illness of how you feel  and if you feel better  then you are effectively not depressed anymore. So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments. And I get letters  I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what's worked for them. Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation. My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy  medication  she had tried pretty much everything  and she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world  and that was making little things from yarn. She sent me some of them. And I'm not wearing them right now. I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM. And yet  when I went to look at alternative treatments  I also gained perspective on other treatments. I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal that involved a great deal of ram's blood and that I'm not going to detail right now  but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda  working on a different project  and I happened to describe my experience to someone  and he said   Well  that's West Africa  and we're in East Africa  and our rituals are in some ways very different  but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what you're describing.  And he said   But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers  especially the ones who came right after the genocide.  I said   What kind of trouble did you have   And he said   Well  they would do this bizarre thing. They didn't take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better. They didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going. They didn't involve the whole community. They didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit. Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them.  He said   We had to ask them to leave the country.  Now at the other end of alternative treatments  let me tell you about Frank Russakoff. Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man. He was constantly depressed. He was  when I met him  at a point at which every month  he would have electroshock treatment. Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week. Then he would feel okay for a week. Then he would have a week of going downhill. And then he would have another electroshock treatment. And he said to me when I met him   It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way. I can't go on this way  and I've figured out how I'm going to end it if I don't get better.   But   he said to me   I heard about a protocol at Mass General for a procedure called a cingulotomy  which is a brain surgery  and I think I'm going to give that a try.  And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him  somewhere  enough optimism to reach out for one more. And he had the cingulotomy  and it was incredibly successful. He's now a friend of mine. He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children. He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery  and he said   My father sent me two presents this year  First  a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image that I didn't really need  but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love. And the other present was a photo of my grandmother  who committed suicide. As I unwrapped it  I began to cry  and my mother came over and said  'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew ' And I said  'She had the same disease I have.' I'm crying now as I write to you. It's not that I'm so sad  but I get overwhelmed  I think  because I could have killed myself  but my parents kept me going  and so did the doctors  and I had the surgery. I'm alive and grateful. We live in the right time  even if it doesn't always feel like it.  I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern  Western  middle class thing  and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts  and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent. And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression. And what I discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression. Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability  which is presumably evenly distributed in the population  and triggering circumstances  which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished. And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time  you think   Why do I feel like this  I must have depression.  And you set out to find treatment for it. But if you have a perfectly awful life  and you feel miserable all the time  the way you feel is commensurate with your life  and it doesn't occur to you to think   Maybe this is treatable.  And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people that's not being picked up and that's not being treated and that's not being addressed  and it's a tragedy of a grand order. And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C.  where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression  and then provided six months of the experimental protocol. One of them  Lolly  came in  and this is what she said the day she came in. She said  and she was a woman  by the way  who had seven children. She said   I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldn't go out of the house. I have nothing to say to my children. In the morning  I can't wait for them to leave  and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head  and three o'clock when they come home  it just comes so fast.  She said   I've been taking a lot of Tylenol  anything I can take so that I can sleep more. My husband has been telling me I'm stupid  I'm ugly. I wish I could stop the pain.  Well  she was brought into this experimental protocol  and when I interviewed her six months later  she had taken a job working in childcare for the U.S. Navy  she had left the abusive husband  and she said to me   My kids are so much happier now.  She said   There's one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls  but at night  they're just all up on my bed  and we're doing homework all together and everything. One of them wants to be a preacher  one of them wants to be a firefighter  and one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer. They don't cry like they used to  and they don't fight like they did. That's all I need now  is my kids. Things keep on changing  the way I dress  the way I feel  the way I act. I can go outside not being afraid anymore  and I don't think those bad feelings are coming back  and if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that  I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head  if I were still alive at all. I asked the Lord to send me an angel  and He heard my prayers.  I was really moved by these experiences  and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on  but also in an article  and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent. And I turned in my story  and my editor called me and said   We really can't publish this.  And I said   Why not   And she said   It just is too far fetched. These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley  It's just too implausible.  She said   I've never even heard of anything like it.  And I said   The fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news.   And you are a news magazine.  So after a certain amount of negotiation  they agreed to it. But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment  the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities  that would be exploitative  because we would be changing them. There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us  that treatment of depression  the medications and so on  are an artifice  and that it's not natural. And I think that's very misguided. It would be natural for people's teeth to fall out  but there is nobody militating against toothpaste  at least not in my circles. People then say   But isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience  Didn't we evolve to have depression  Isn't it part of your personality   To which I would say  mood is adaptive. Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have  that's incredibly valuable. And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken. It's maladaptive. People will come to me and say   I think  though  if I just stick it out for another year  I think I can just get through this.  And I always say to them   You may get through it  but you'll never be    again. Life is short  and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up. Think it through.  It's a strange poverty of the English language  and indeed of many other languages  that we use this same word  depression  to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday  and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide. People say to me   Well  is it continuous with normal sadness   And I say  in a way it's continuous with normal sadness. There is a certain amount of continuity  but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting  and what happens if you leave the house for     years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust. And it's that orange dust spot  that orange dust problem  that's the one we're setting out to address. So now people say   You take these happy pills  and do you feel happy   And I don't. But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch  and I don't feel sad about my answering machine  and I don't feel sad about taking a shower. I feel more  in fact  I think  because I can feel sadness without nullity. I feel sad about professional disappointments  about damaged relationships  about global warming. Those are the things that I feel sad about now. And I said to myself  well  what is the conclusion  How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through  What is the mechanism of resilience  And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience  and say   I was depressed a long time ago  I never want to think about it again  I'm not going to look at it and I'm just going to get on with my life   ironically  those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have. Shutting out the depression strengthens it. While you hide from it  it grows. And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience. So Frank Russakoff said to me   If I had a do over  I suppose I wouldn't do it this way  but in a strange way  I'm grateful for what I've experienced. I'm glad to have been in the hospital    times. It taught me so much about love  and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me  and will be always.  And Maggie Robbins said   I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic  and I would just talk and talk and talk  and the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive  and I thought  'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.'   And then I realized  I realized that they weren't going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk. It was simply going to be an occasion where I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying  but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were. Our needs are our greatest assets. It turns out I've learned to give all the things I need.  Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse  but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate. The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful. It's of seeking that meaning and thinking  when it comes again   This will be hellish  but I will learn something from it.  I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be  how it can be more real than facts  and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. The opposite of depression is not happiness  but vitality  and these days  my life is vital  even on the days when I'm sad. I felt that funeral in my brain  and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world  and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day    years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit. I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again  I've found a way to love my depression. I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. I love it because each day I decide  sometimes gamely  and sometimes against the moment's reason  to cleave to the reasons for living. And that  I think  is a highly privileged rapture. Thank you. Thank you. Nine years ago  I worked for the U.S. government in Iraq  helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure. And I was there  and I worked in that job because I believe that technology can improve people's lives. One afternoon  I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad  and he said to me   You Americans  you can put a man on the moon  but when I get home tonight  I won't be able to turn on my lights.  At the time  the U.S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction. How do you ensure technology reaches users  How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful  So those are the questions that my colleagues and I at D Rev ask ourselves. And D Rev is short for Design Revolution. And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users  and not just any users  but customers who live on less than four dollars a day. One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices  and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then  there are some commonalities. Despite the advanced technology  it's not reaching the people who need it most. So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on  the ReMotion Knee  and it's a prosthetic knee for above knee amputees. And this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization  the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world  came to the Bay Area and they said   We need a better knee.  Chances are  if you're living on less than four dollars a day  and you're an amputee  you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident. Most people think it's land mines  but it's a vehicle accident. You're walking by the side of the road and you're hit by a truck  or you're trying to to jump on a moving train  you're late for work  and your pant leg gets caught. And the reality is that if you don't have much money  like this young named Kamal right here  the option you really have is a bamboo staff to get around. And how big a problem is this  There's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee. And what are their options  This is a high end. This is what we'd call a  smart knee.  It's got a microprocessor inside. It can pretty much do anything  but it's        dollars  and to give you a sense of who wears this  veterans  American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq would be fit with something like this. This is a low end titanium knee. It's a polycentric knee  and all that that means is the mechanism  is a four bar mechanism  that mimics a natural human knee. But at       dollars  it's still too expensive for people like Kamal. And lastly  here you see a low end knee. This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people. And while you have affordability  you've lost on functionality. The mechanism here is a single axis  and a single axis is like a door hinge. So you can think about how unstable that would be. And this is the type of mechanism that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee  and I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like  because I'm showing you all these knees and I imagine it's hard to think  how it all fits together. So at the top you have a socket  and this fits over someone's residual limb  and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different. And then you have the knee  and here I've got a single axis on the knee so you can see how it rotates  and then a pylon  and then a foot. And we've been able to develop a knee  a polycentric knee  so that type of knee that acts like a human knee  mimics human gait  for    dollars retail. But the key is  you can have this great invention  you can have this great design  but how do you get it to the people who most need it  How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives  So at D Rev  we've done some other projects  and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers  to users  to people who need it. And the first thing is that the product  needs to be world class. It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market. Regardless of your income level  you want the most beautiful  the best product that there is. I'm going to show you a video now of a man named Ash. You can see him walking. He's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee. And he's doing a    meter walk test. And you'll notice that he's struggling  with stability as he's walking. And something that's not obvious  that you can't see  is that it's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling. Now this is a video of Kamal. You remember Kamal earlier  holding the bamboo staff. He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee  and he's doing that same    meter walk test. And you can see his stability is much better. So world class isn't just about technical performance. It's also about human performance. And most medical devices  we've learned  as we've dug in  are really designed for Westerners  for wealthier economies. But the reality is our users  our customers  they do different things. They sit cross legged more. We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer. And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market. So the second thing we learned  and this leads into my second point  which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user centric. And at D Rev  we go one step further and we say you need to be user obsessed. So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about  but everyone who interacts with the product  so  for example  the prosthetist who fits the knee  but also the context in which the knee is being fit. What is the local market like  How do all these components get to the clinic  Do they all get there on time  The supply chain. Everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user  and it goes in as part of the system  and it's used. So I wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version  the Jaipur Knee  so this is it right here. Notice anything about it  It clicks. We'd seen that users had actually modified it. So do you see that black strip right there  That's a homemade noise dampener. We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways. You can see there that that particular amputee  he had wrapped bandages around the knee. He'd made a cosmesis. And if you look at the knee  it's got those pointy edges  right  So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari  it's really obvious that you're wearing a prosthetic limb  and in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled  people are particularly acute about this. So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did. We did a lot of iterations  not just  around this  but some other things. But here we have the version three   the ReMotion Knee  but if you look in here  you can see the noise dampener. It's quieter. The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile. We made it thinner. And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production. And this goes into my last point. We really  truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed  it needs to be market driven  and market driven means that products are sold. They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized. Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user. It also has to be designed to be very affordable. But a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer  and use is what creates impact. And we believe that as designers  it holds us accountable to our customers. And with centralized manufacturing  you can control the quality control  and you can hit that     price point with profit margins built in. And now  those profit margins are critical  because if you want to scale  if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee  it needs to be economically sustainable. So I want to give you a sense of where we are at. We have fit over       amputees  and one of the big indicators we're looking at  of course  is  does it improve lives  Well  the standard is  is someone still wearing their knee six months later  The industry average is about    percent. Ours is    percent  and we're hoping to get that higher. Right now  our knees are worn in    countries. This is where we want to get  though  in the next three years. We'll double the impact in       and we'll double it each of the following years after that. But then we hit a new challenge  and that's the number of skilled prosthetists who are able to fit knees. So I want to end with a story of Pournima. Pournima was    years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg  and she traveled    hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee  and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers  she's particularly meaningful to me  as an engineer and as a woman  because she was in school  she had just started school to study engineering. And she said   Well  now that I can walk again  I can go back and complete my studies.  And to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users. So thank you. I want you to  for a moment  think about playing a game of Monopoly  except in this game  that combination of skill  talent and luck that help earn you success in games  as in life  has been rendered irrelevant  because this game's been rigged  and you've got the upper hand. You've got more money  more opportunities to move around the board  and more access to resources. And as you think about that experience  I want you to ask yourself  how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way that you think about yourself and regard that other player  So we ran a study on the U.C. Berkeley campus to look at exactly that question. We brought in more than     pairs of strangers into the lab  and with the flip of a coin randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game. They got two times as much money. When they passed Go  they collected twice the salary  and they got to roll both dice instead of one  so they got to move around the board a lot more. And over the course of    minutes  we watched through hidden cameras what happened. And what I want to do today  for the first time  is show you a little bit of what we saw. You're going to have to pardon the sound quality  in some cases  because again  these were hidden cameras. So we've provided subtitles. Rich Player  How many    s did you have  Poor Player  Just one. Rich Player  Are you serious. Poor Player  Yeah. Rich Player  I have three.  Laughs  I don't know why they gave me so much. Paul Piff  Okay  so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up. One person clearly has a lot more money than the other person  and yet  as the game unfolded  we saw very notable differences and dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players. The rich player started to move around the board louder  literally smacking the board with their piece as he went around. We were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs  displays of power and celebration among the rich players. We had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side. It's on the bottom right corner there. That allowed us to watch participants' consummatory behavior. So we're just tracking how many pretzels participants eat. Rich Player  Are those pretzels a trick  Poor Player  I don't know. PP  Okay  so no surprises  people are onto us. They wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place. One even asks  like you just saw  is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick  And yet  despite that  the power of the situation seems to inevitably dominate  and those rich players start to eat more pretzels. Rich Player  I love pretzels. PP  And as the game went on  one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person  less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor  poor players  and more and more demonstrative of their material success  more likely to showcase how well they're doing. Rich Player  I have money for everything. Poor Player  How much is that  Rich Player  You owe me    dollars. You're going to lose all your money soon. I'll buy it. I have so much money. I have so much money  it takes me forever. Rich Player    I'm going to buy out this whole board. Rich Player    You're going to run out of money soon. I'm pretty much untouchable at this point. PP  Okay  and here's what I think was really  really interesting  is that at the end of the    minutes  we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game. And when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of Monopoly    they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game  and they became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation  including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place. And that's a really  really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage. Now this game of Monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure  wherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status  and a lot of people don't. They have a lot less wealth and a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources. And what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies. What we've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person's levels of wealth increase  their feelings of compassion and empathy go down  and their feelings of entitlement  of deservingness  and their ideology of self interest increases. In surveys  we found that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good  and that the pursuit of self interest is favorable and moral. Now what I want to do today is talk about some of the implications of this ideology self interest  talk about why we should care about those implications  and end with what might be done. Some of the first studies that we ran in this area looked at helping behavior  something social psychologists call pro social behavior. And we were really interested in who's more likely to offer help to another person  someone who's rich or someone who's poor. In one of the studies  we bring in rich and poor members of the community into the lab and give each of them the equivalent of    dollars. We told the participants that they could keep these    dollars for themselves  or they could share a portion of it  if they wanted to  with a stranger who is totally anonymous. They'll never meet that stranger and the stranger will never meet them. And we just monitor how much people give. Individuals who made        sometimes under        dollars a year  gave    percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making         or         dollars a year. We've had people play games to see who's more or less likely to cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize. In one of the games  we actually rigged a computer so that die rolls over a certain score were impossible. You couldn't get above    in this game  and yet  the richer you were  the more likely you were to cheat in this game to earn credits toward a     cash prize  sometimes by three to four times as much. We ran another study where we looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children    participating    I'm not kidding. I know it sounds like I'm making a joke. We explicitly told participants this jar of candy's for children participating in a developmental lab nearby. They're in studies. This is for them. And we just monitored how much candy participants took. Participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor. We've even studied cars  not just any cars  but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law. In one of these studies  we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk. Now in California  as you all know  because I'm sure we all do this  it's the law to stop for a pedestrian who's waiting to cross. So here's an example of how we did it. That's our confederate off to the left posing as a pedestrian. He approaches as the red truck successfully stops. In typical California fashion  it's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over. Now here's an example of a more expensive car  a Prius  driving through  and a BMW doing the same. So we did this for hundreds of vehicles on several days  just tracking who stops and who doesn't. What we found was that as the expensiveness of a car increased  the driver's tendencies to break the law increased as well. None of the cars  none of the cars in our least expensive car category broke the law. Close to    percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category broke the law. We've run other studies finding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations  to endorse unethical behavior at work like stealing cash from the cash register  taking bribes  lying to customers. Now I don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior. Not at all. In fact  I think that we all  in our day to day  minute by minute lives  struggle with these competing motivations of when  or if  to put our own interests above the interests of other people. And that's understandable because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper  as long as we apply ourselves and work hard  and a piece of that means that sometimes  you need to put your own interests above the interests and well being of other people around you. But what we're finding is that  the wealthier you are  the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success  of achievement and accomplishment  to the detriment of others around you. Here I've plotted for you the mean household income received by each fifth and top five percent of the population over the last    years. In       the differences between the different quintiles of the population  in terms of income  are fairly egregious. It's not difficult to discern that there are differences. But over the last    years  that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else. In fact  the top    percent of our population own close to    percent of the total wealth in this country. We're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality. What that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals  but the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us. And if it's the case  as we've been finding  that the wealthier you are  the more entitled you feel to that wealth  and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people  and be willing to do things to serve that self interest  well then there's no reason to think that those patterns will change. In fact  there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse  and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same  at the same linear rate  over the next    years. Now  inequality  economic inequality  is something we should all be concerned about  and not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy  but because individuals and groups with lots of economic inequality do worse  not just the people at the bottom  everyone. There's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world showcasing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse. Social mobility  things we really care about  physical health  social trust  all go down as inequality goes up. Similarly  negative things in social collectives and societies  things like obesity  and violence  imprisonment  and punishment  are exacerbated as economic inequality increases. Again  these are outcomes not just experienced by a few  but that resound across all strata of society. Even people at the top experience these outcomes. So what do we do  This cascade of self perpetuating  pernicious  negative effects could seem like something that's spun out of control  and there's nothing we can do about it  certainly nothing we as individuals could do. But in fact  we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions  small changes to people's values  small nudges in certain directions  can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy. For instance  reminding people of the benefits of cooperation  or the advantages of community  cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people. In one study  we had people watch a brief video  just    seconds long  about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them  and after watching that  we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress. After watching this video  an hour later  rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person  a stranger  as someone who's poor  suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical  but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values  and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy. And beyond the walls of our lab  we're even beginning to see  signs of change in society. Bill Gates  one of our nation's wealthiest individuals  in his Harvard commencement speech  talked about the problem facing society of inequality as being the most daunting challenge  and talked about what must be done to combat it  saying   Humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries  but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.  And there's the Giving Pledge  in which more than     of our nation's wealthiest individuals are pledging half of their fortunes to charity. And there's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements  like We are the One Percent  the Resource Generation  or Wealth for Common Good  in which the most privileged members of the population  members of the one percent and elsewhere  people who are wealthy  are using their own economic resources  adults and youth alike  that's what's most striking to me  leveraging their own privilege  their own economic resources  to combat inequality by advocating for social policies  changes in social values  and changes in people's behavior  that work against their own economic interests but that may ultimately restore the American dream. Thank you. It's the fifth time I stand on this shore  the Cuban shore  looking out at that distant horizon  believing  again  that I'm going to make it all the way across that vast  dangerous wilderness of an ocean. Not only have I tried four times  but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since       and it's still never been done. The team is proud of our four attempts. It's an expedition of some    people. Bonnie is my best friend and head handler  who somehow summons will  that last drop of will within me  when I think it's gone  after many  many hours and days out there. The shark experts are the best in the world    large predators below. The box jellyfish  the deadliest venom in all of the ocean  is in these waters  and I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt. The conditions themselves  besides the sheer distance of over     miles in the open ocean    the currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself  the most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth. And by the way  it's amusing to me that journalists and people before these attempts often ask me   Well  are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything   And I'm thinking  what are they imagining  That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation  and carry a bowie knife in my mouth  and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them  and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water. Yes  I have a team.  Laughter  And the team is expert  and the team is courageous  and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery  as is true with any major expedition on the planet. And we've been on a journey. And the debate has raged  hasn't it  since the Greeks  of isn't it what it's all about  Isn't life about the journey  not really the destination  And here we've been on this journey  and the truth is  it's been thrilling. We haven't reached that other shore  and still our sense of pride and commitment  unwavering commitment. When I turned     the dream was still alive from having tried this in my   s  and dreamed it and imagined it. The most famous body of water on the Earth today  I imagine  Cuba to Florida. And it was deep. It was deep in my soul. And when I turned     it wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment  it wasn't the ego of  I want to be the first.  That's always there and it's undeniable. But it was deeper. It was  how much life is there left  Let's face it  we're all on a one way street  aren't we  and what are we going to do  What are we going to do as we go forward to have no regrets looking back  And all this past year in training  I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote to paraphrase it  floating around in my brain  and it says   You go ahead  you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic  you be the observer  while the brave one gets in the ring and engages and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again  but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid and lives life in a bold way.  And so of course I want to make it across. It is the goal  and I should be so shallow to say that this year  the destination was even sweeter than the journey. But the journey itself was worthwhile taking. And at this point  by this summer  everybody    scientists  sports scientists  endurance experts  neurologists  my own team  Bonnie    said it's impossible. It just simply can't be done  and Bonnie said to me   But if you're going to take the journey  I'm going to see you through to the end of it  so I'll be there.  And now we're there. And as we're looking out  kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke  standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway  the Cuban flag is flying above  all my team's out in their boats  hands up in the air   We're here  we're here for you   Bonnie and I look at each other  and we say  this year  the mantra is    and I've been using it in training    find a way. You have a dream and you have obstacles in front of you  as we all do. None of us ever get through this life without heartache  without turmoil  and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality  you find your way  and Bonnie grabbed my shoulders  and she said   Let's find our way to Florida.  And we started  and for the next    hours  it was an intense  unforgettable life experience. The highs were high  the awe  I'm not a religious person  but I'll tell you  to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream as if  as you're breathing  you're looking down miles and miles and miles  to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on  it's awe inspiring. I have a playlist of about    songs  and especially in the middle of the night  and that night  because we use no lights    lights attract jellyfish  lights attract sharks  lights attract baitfish that attract sharks  so we go in the pitch black of the night. You've never seen black this black. You can't see the front of your hand  and the people on the boat  Bonnie and my team on the boat  they just hear the slapping of the arms  and they know where I am  because there's no visual at all. And I'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist. I've got a tight rubber cap  so I don't hear a thing. I've got goggles and I'm turning my head    times a minute  and I'm singing    Imagine there's no heaven     doo doo doo doo doo     It's easy if you try     doo doo doo doo doo   And I can sing that song a thousand times in a row. Now there's a talent unto itself. And each time I get done with   Ooh  you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one      .   Imagine there's no heaven   And when I get through the end of a thousand of John Lennon's  Imagine   I have swum nine hours and    minutes  exactly. And then there are the crises. Of course there are. And the vomiting starts  the seawater  you're not well  you're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection. It's difficult to swim in. It's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth  but the tentacles can't get you. And the hypothermia sets in. The water's    degrees  and yet you're losing weight and using calories  and as you come over toward the side of the boat  not allowed to touch it  not allowed to get out  but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and asks me what I'm doing  am I all right  I am seeing the Taj Mahal over here. I'm in a very different state  and I'm thinking  wow  I never thought I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here. It's gorgeous. I mean  how long did it take them to build that  It's just    So  uh  wooo.  Laughter  And then we kind of have a cardinal rule that I'm never told  really  how far it is  because we don't know how far it is. What's going to happen to you between this point and that point  What's going to happen to the weather and the currents and  God forbid  you're stung when you don't think you could be stung in all this armor  and Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning that I was suffering and I was hanging on by a thread and she said   Come here   and I came close to the boat  and she said   Look  look out there   and I saw light  because the day's easier than the night  and I thought we were coming into day  and I saw a stream of white light along the horizon  and I said   It's going to be morning soon.  And she said   No  those are the lights of Key West.  It was    more hours  which for most swimmers would be a long time. You have no idea how many    hour training swims I had done. So here we go  and I somehow  without a decision  went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting Stephen Hawking and the parameters of the universe  I just went into thinking about this dream  and why  and how. And as I said  when I turned     it wasn't about that concrete  Can you do it   That's the everyday machinations. That's the discipline  and it's the preparation  and there's a pride in that. But I decided to think  as I went along  about  the phrase usually is reaching for the stars  and in my case  it's reaching for the horizon. And when you reach for the horizon  as I've proven  you may not get there  but what a tremendous build of character and spirit that you lay down. What a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons. And now the shore is coming  and there's just a little part of me that's sad. The epic journey is going to be over. So many people come up to me now and say   What's next  We love that  That little tracker that was on the computer  When are you going to do the next one  We just can't wait to follow the next one.  Well  they were just there for    hours  and I was there for years. And so there won't be another epic journey in the ocean. But the point is  and the point was that every day of our lives is epic  and I'll tell you  when I walked up onto that beach  staggered up onto that beach  and I had so many times in a very puffed up ego way  rehearsed what I would say on the beach. When Bonnie thought that the back of my throat was swelling up  and she brought the medical team over to our boat to say that she's really beginning to have trouble breathing. Another        hours in the saltwater  the whole thing    and I just thought in my hallucinatory moment  that I heard the word tracheotomy. And Bonnie said to the doctor   I'm not worried about her not breathing. If she can't talk when she gets to the shore  she's gonna be pissed off.  But the truth is  all those orations that I had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation  it wasn't like that. It was a very real moment  with that crowd  with my team. We did it. I didn't do it. We did it. And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us. And the three things that I did sort of blurt out when we got there  was first   Never  ever give up.  I live it. What's the phrase from today from Socrates  To be is to do. So I don't stand up and say  don't ever give up. I didn't give up  and there was action behind these words. The second is   You can chase your dreams at any age  you're never too old.  Sixty four  that no one at any age  any gender  could ever do  has done it  and there's no doubt in my mind that I am at the prime of my life today. Yeah. Thank you. And the third thing I said on that beach was   It looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world  and in many ways  of course  it is  and in other ways  and the most important ways  it's a team  and if you think I'm a badass  you want to meet Bonnie.  Bonnie  where are you  Where are you  There's Bonnie Stoll.  Applause  My buddy. The Henry David Thoreau quote goes  when you achieve your dreams  it's not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them. And yeah  I stand before you now. In the three months since that swim ended  I've sat down with Oprah and I've been in President Obama's Oval Office. I've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves. I've signed a wonderful major book contract. All of that's great  and I don't denigrate it. I'm proud of it all  but the truth is  I'm walking around tall because I am that bold  fearless person  and I will be  every day  until it's time for these days to be done. Thank you very much and enjoy the conference. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Find a way   Applause
